Let's analyze the situation around the revealed numbers. \n\nLooking at the top-left part of the board, we see a '2' at position (1,2) and a '1' at position (0,3). Since there is already a '1' at position (0,3), it's likely that the bomb is located above or to the left of the '1'. However, we can't be certain yet.\n\nMoving to the bottom part of the board, we see a '3' at position (7,6). This suggests that there are three bombs in the adjacent squares. We also see a '2' at position (8,6), which indicates two bombs in the adjacent squares.\n\nConsidering the remaining number of flags (10) and bombs (10), we should be cautious not to place too many flags without sufficient evidence.\n\nOne potential move is to reveal the tile at position (8,5). This tile is adjacent to the '2' at position (8,6) and the '1' at position (9,6). Revealing this tile may provide more information about the location of the bombs.\n\nMOVE: 8,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . . 2 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 . . 2 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n3 . . 2 _ _ _ 1 . 1 _\n4 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n5 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n6 1 1 1 _ 1 . 2 1 1 _\n7 . . 1 _ 1 1 3 . 2 _\n8 . 2 1 _ _ _ 2 . 3 1\n9 . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . . .", "sucess": true}

Since there are no flags placed yet, we can start by analyzing the revealed numbers. The top-left 1 at position (0,3) suggests that there is a bomb adjacent to it. Given the empty space below it, it's likely that the bomb is either to the left or right of the 1. However, without more information, we can't be certain. \n\nA safer approach would be to look for a space that is likely to be empty. The 2 at position (1,2) has an adjacent 1, which suggests that the space above the 2 is likely to be empty.
