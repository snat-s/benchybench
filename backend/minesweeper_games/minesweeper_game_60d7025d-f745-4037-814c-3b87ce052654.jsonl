The `1` at (0, 7) already has one adjacent unexplored square (0, 8) and is surrounded by (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 7), and possibly (1, 6). But there's no immediate conflict since it can accommodate one bomb.\n\n2. The `2` at (1, 7) has one adjacent flag already placed nearby and needs at least one more adjacent bomb. The current arrangement leaves us with two unexplored squares around it: (1, 8) and (0, 7).\n\n3. The `1` at (1, 8) also supports an unexplored square (1, 9) or (2, 8). However, we only know that (2, 8) is adjacent to this `1`.\n\n4. We look to the `2` at (3, 7) that has adjacent squares: (2, 7), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 7). The current known flags do not conflict with this, and this will not be an issue at this moment.\n\nAfter reviewing numbers and flags, it becomes evident that the area around (1, 8) and (2, 8) needs attention, as they might hold bombs.

This means that (0, 1) cannot have another bomb adjacent to it.\n   - The tile at (1, 7) is a '2' and has 1 adjacent flag at (0, 1). This means there has to be at least 1 more bomb in the adjacent unflagged tiles.\n   - The tile at (3, 1) is a '1' with 1 flag already, thus it cannot have an adjacent bomb.\n\n2. **Potential Conflicts**:\n   - The tile at (3, 1) needs its adjacent flag to remain safe (since it shows '1'). Hence, there can't be a bomb in any adjacent space to (3, 1) which includes (2, 0) or (2, 1) or similar.\n   - The tile at (4, 5) shows '1', it has no flags next to it but needs one due to adjacent tiles showing either 'x' or 'x' + 1.\n\n3. **Safe Moves**:\n   - The tile at (4, 2) is currently unflagged and doesn't interfere with neighboring tiles.\n   - The tile at (4, 3) is also a good candidate for revealing since it doesn't block any adjacent tiles.\n   - All tiles at (8, 1) and (8, 2) are visible and safe to reveal since their adjacent tiles make it clear that no bombs exist there.\n\n### Suggested Move:\n1. Given that (4, 1) is a '1' and already has two adjacent-unflagged tiles that could potentially be one next to it, revealing (4, 3) seems ideal where this would help clarify parts of (3, 5) being flagged.\n2.
