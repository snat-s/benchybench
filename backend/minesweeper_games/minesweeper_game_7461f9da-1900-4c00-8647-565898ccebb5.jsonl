The board is completely unexplored.\n\nFor the first move in Minesweeper, it's generally best to reveal a random spot, often starting in a corner or the center of the board. The first move in most implementations of Minesweeper is guaranteed to be safe, as the game typically places mines after the first click.\n\nThe center of the board would be around coordinates (4,4) or (5,5), which gives the highest probability of creating larger open areas, as corners and edges tend to be more constrained.\n\nEXPLANATION: Making my first move near the center of the board, which is typically safer and more likely to open up a larger area.\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
