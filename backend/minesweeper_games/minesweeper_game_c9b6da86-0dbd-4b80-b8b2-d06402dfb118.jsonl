The best initial strategy is to choose a middle square that has a higher probability of being safe, as it's less likely to be near edge bombs.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nI chose the center square (4,4) for the first move because:\n1. It's in the middle of the board\n2. It reduces the chance of an immediate game-ending bomb\n3. Provides the most initial information about surrounding tiles\n4. Gives us the best opportunity to understand the bomb distribution\n\nThis move will reveal a square, and depending on the result (a number or empty space), we'll gain crucial information to guide our subsequent moves.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

I notice several areas with some clear patterns and some potential flag locations.\n\n2. Looking at the bottom left area around (5,2) to (7,2), there are some interesting number patterns.\n   - (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) all show '1', suggesting bombs are nearby but not immediately adjacent\n   - (6,3) is an unexplored tile next to these '1's\n\n3. Around (7,1) to (7,2), we see a '2' which currently has no flags. This suggests two bombs are nearby.\n\n4. I'm going to start by checking a square that seems relatively safe.\n\nEXPLANATION: The square at (6,3) looks promising. It's near some '1' tiles but not definitively indicating a bomb.
