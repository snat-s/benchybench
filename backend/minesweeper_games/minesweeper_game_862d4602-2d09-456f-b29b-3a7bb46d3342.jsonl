The tile at (5,3) is a '1', and it has only one unexplored adjacent tile at (4,2). Therefore, (4,2) must contain a bomb.\n\n2. The tile at (5,4) is a '1', and the unexplored tiles around it are (4,3) and (5,5). However, since (4,2) is a bomb because of the '1' at (5,3), (5,5) cannot be a bomb.

The number '2' at position (3,3) already has one adjacent flag at (4,2). This means there must be exactly one more bomb among its other adjacent tiles, which are (3,2), (3,4), and (4,3).\n\nSince the (3,4) and (4,3) are next to the '2' at (4,4), and there are no adjacent flags to this '2', placing a flag at either of these positions would satisfy the '2' requirement for both (3,3) and (4,3). To maximize the potential information gained and avoid unnecessary risk, we should reveal a tile that is most likely to yield new information.\n\nThe safest next move is to reveal the only remaining non-flagged, unexplored tile next to both '2's on the fourth row \u2014 tile (4,1).
