Looking at the board, we have several safe-looking areas and some potentially dangerous zones.\n\n2. The bottom left (lower left quadrant) looks promising for exploration, especially around (8,0) to (9,3).\n\n3. The '3' at (5,9) is particularly interesting. It currently has 2 flags adjacent, which means it should have one more bomb nearby.\n\n4. The '1' at (4,4) seems to have a suspicious area near the flagged space at (4,7).\n\n5. Given the remaining flags (9) and total bombs (10), we're likely close to solving the board.\n\nSTRATEGIC MOVE:\nI'll reveal a tile in the safer-looking bottom left area.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (8,1) looks relatively safe.
