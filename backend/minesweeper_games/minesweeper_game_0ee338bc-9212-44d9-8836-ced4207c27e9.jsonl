{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 2, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Let's analyze the current state of the board step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Check existing numbers and flags\n- **Position (0,6):** It shows '1'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles (0,5), (1,5), and (1,6).\n- **Position (1,4):** It shows '1'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles (0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,3), and (2,4).\n- **Position (1,5):** It shows '1'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), and (2,5).\n- **Position (1,6):** It shows '2'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly two bombs in the adjacent unexplored tiles (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), and (2,7).\n- **Position (2,3):** It shows '1'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), and (3,4).\n- **Position (2,4):** It shows '2'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly two bombs in the adjacent unexplored tiles (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5).\n- **Position (3,3):** It shows '1'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4).\n- **Position (4,3):** It shows '2'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly two bombs in the adjacent unexplored tiles (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), and (5,4).\n- **Position (5,1):** It shows '1'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), and (6,2).\n- **Position (5,2):** It shows '1'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), and (6,3).\n- **Position (5,3):** It shows '2'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly two bombs in the adjacent unexplored tiles (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), and (6,4).\n- **Position (6,1):** It shows '1'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), and (7,2).\n- **Position (7,0):** It shows '1'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), and (8,1).\n- **Position (7,1):** It shows '2'. There are no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly two bombs in the adjacent unexplored tiles (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), and (8,2).\n\n### Step 2: Look for obvious conflicts\n- No obvious conflicts are present at this stage.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\n- Flags remaining: 10\n- Bombs: 10\n\n### Step 4: Decide on the next move\n- **Position (1,6):** It shows '2', and there are no adjacent flags. There must be exactly two bombs in the adjacent unexplored tiles (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), and (2,7). Given the complexity, we should look for a safer move elsewhere.\n- **Position (5,3):** It shows '2', and there are no adjacent flags. There must be exactly two bombs in the adjacent unexplored tiles (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), and (6,4). Again, this is complex.\n- **Position (6,1):** It shows '1', and there are no adjacent flags. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), and (7,2). Given that (5,1) and (5,2) are already revealed and safe, we can deduce that the bomb must be in one of the remaining unexplored tiles.\n\n### Conclusion\n- The safest move is to reveal one of the unexplored tiles adjacent to (6,1), as it has a higher chance of being safe.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Revealing a tile adjacent to (6,1) is the safest move because it reduces the uncertainty of bomb placement in that area.\n**MOVE:** 6,2,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 . . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 2 . . . . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n4 _ _ _ 2 . . . . . .\n5 _ 1 1 2 . . . . . .\n6 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n7 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
