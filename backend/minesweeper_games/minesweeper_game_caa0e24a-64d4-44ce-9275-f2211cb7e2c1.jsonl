We'll look for squares that are adjacent to numbers with a known number of adjacent bombs.

Check the position (1,8) where the number 1 is visible. The unexplored adjacent squares are: (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,8), and (2,9). Since there are no flagged squares around it yet, it suggests one of these must be bombed, but it's not definitive which one without more information.\n\n2. Examine position (2,2) showing the number 1, with unexplored squares (1,3), (2,3), and (3,3). Since only (1,3) and (3,3) are unexplored near other 2s and neither has too many uncovered unexplored neighbors, revealing in these locations could be safer choices.\n\n3. Position (2,5) is surrounded by unexplored squares at (1,5), (1,6), and (2,6), with a '3' in position (2,4). Since (1,5) has other numbers defining its risk, and (2,6) is adjacent to a clear '1', this suggests (1,5) and revealing more of (2,5)'s unknowns might clarify the board and be a significant risk spot.\n\nAnalyzing these options leads to more insight, but for a safer, more conservative path, an approach could be chosen from less impact-immediate numbers in broader context away from understood mines or reveals, looking towards expanding potential knowns safely.\n\nHence, I choose to reveal at less emphasized numbers to lower immediate board risk.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (2,3) appears least boarded in potential miscues, outside overcrowded numerals and risks, while still adjacent to driving board advances with less density numerical overload potential.\n\nMOVE: 2,3,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 2 . . 1 _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ 2 . . 2 1 _ 1 1\n2 _ _ 1 2 3 . 1 _ 1 .\n3 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n5 _ _ 1 2 2 1 _ 1 . .\n6 1 1 2 . . 1 _ 1 1 1\n7 . . 3 2 2 1 _ _ _ _\n8 . . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}

Looking at the tiles with numbers and their adjacent unexplored spaces, several opportunities become apparent. For instance, consider the Explorer (2,2), which indicates only 1 bomb among the adjacent tiles. This position is surrounded by several unexplored spaces, but because we have identified that all possible positions except (2,2) are already secure, it suggests that other options must be safe.\n\nNext, explore the (6,9) tile, which shows the number 1. All but one of its adjacent unexplored tiles have been explored, implying that the remaining tile cannot contain a bomb. Therefore, exploring the positions which surround (5,9), such as (5,5), produces a safe opportunity that determines the same logic.\n\nBased on the current analysis and understanding, we can conclude that exploring the position directly beneath it at (2,5) will lead to a safe operation.\n\nMOVE: 2,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 2 . . 1 _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ 2 . . 2 1 _ 1 1\n2 _ _ 1 2 3 . 1 _ 1 .\n3 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n5 _ _ 1 2 2 1 _ 1 . .\n6 1 1 2 . . 1 _ 1 1 1\n7 . . 3 2 2 1 _ _ _ _\n8 . . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": false}
