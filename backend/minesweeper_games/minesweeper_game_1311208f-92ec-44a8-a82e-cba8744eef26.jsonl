{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current state of the board. It's a 10x10 grid, and all the squares are still unexplored, represented by dots. The game info tells me that there are 10 bombs placed on the board, and I have 10 flags remaining. Since no moves have been made yet, every square is still a mystery.\n\nI remember that in Minesweeper, the goal is to either reveal all the safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs. Since the game just started, I don't have any revealed numbers or flags to go by. That means I can't use any of the critical flag placement rules yet because there's no information to base decisions on.\n\nI'm thinking about the rules, especially the ones about placing flags correctly. Each number on the board must exactly match the number of adjacent bombs. But since no numbers are revealed, I can't apply those rules right now. Also, I have to be careful not to place flags in a way that conflicts with future revealed numbers.\n\nSince I don't have any information, my options are limited. I could either start by revealing a square to get some information or place a flag somewhere. But placing a flag without any information seems risky because I don't know where the bombs are. If I place a flag incorrectly, it could lead to a conflict later when numbers are revealed.\n\nOn the other hand, revealing a square could give me some clues. If I reveal a number, I can start using the rules to deduce where the bombs might be. If I reveal a bomb, the game ends, so that's a risk, but it's part of the game.\n\nI think the safest move right now is to reveal a square. Since all squares are the same, it doesn't matter which one I choose. I'll pick the top-left corner, (0,0), to reveal. This way, I can start getting some information about the board without the risk of placing a flag incorrectly.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the user hasn't made any moves yet, so the board is completely blank. If I reveal a square and it's a bomb, the game ends. But if it's a number or empty, I can proceed. Since I have no information, I have to take that risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the possibility that placing a flag first could be better, but without any info, it's just a guess. I think revealing is the better approach because it gives me data to work with, even though there's a chance of hitting a bomb.\n\nSo, I'll go ahead and reveal the square at (0,0). Hopefully, it's not a bomb. If it is, the game ends, but that's part of the strategy. If it's a number, I can use that to help place flags more accurately in the future.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Since the board is completely unexplored, the best move is to reveal a square to gain information. Starting with (0,0) is a logical choice to begin uncovering the board's layout.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 1, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, which is standard. There are 10 bombs in total, and I have 10 flags remaining. That means I can potentially flag all the bombs, but I need to be careful not to place any flags incorrectly because that could lead to a conflict with the numbers already revealed.\n\nLooking at the board, the revealed squares are at (0,0) and (0,1), both showing a '1'. The rest are unexplored, which means there's a lot I don't know yet. Since the game is in its early stages, I don't have much information to go on, so I need to be cautious.\n\nFirst, I'll check the revealed numbers against existing flags. Right now, I don't see any flags placed yet because the board only shows '.' and '1's. So there are no flags to check for conflicts. That's a relief because it means I don't have to worry about removing any flags right now.\n\nNext, I think about where to place a flag or reveal a tile. Since I have 10 flags and 10 bombs, I could start by flagging potential bomb locations, but without any information, it's hard to know where to start. Alternatively, revealing a tile might give me more information about the surrounding area, which could help me place flags more accurately in the future.\n\nI notice that (0,0) and (0,1) are both '1's. That means each of these squares has exactly one bomb in their adjacent eight squares. For (0,0), the adjacent squares would be (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). But (0,1) is already a '1', so the bomb adjacent to (0,0) must be in either (1,0) or (1,1). Similarly, for (0,1), the adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2). Since (0,0) is a '1', the bomb for (0,1) must be in one of the other squares.\n\nWait, but if I consider both (0,0) and (0,1) being '1's, maybe the bomb they're both indicating is in the same square. For example, if there's a bomb at (1,0), that would satisfy both (0,0) and (0,1) because each would have one adjacent bomb. Alternatively, if the bomb is at (1,1), that would also satisfy both '1's. Hmm, that's possible.\n\nBut without more information, I can't be sure. Maybe I should try to reveal a square that's adjacent to both (0,0) and (0,1) to see if it's a bomb or a number. Let's think about which square would give me the most information if I reveal it. If I reveal (1,0), and it's a bomb, the game would end, which I don't want. So maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, I could reveal a square that's adjacent to only one of them. For example, revealing (0,2) would only affect (0,1)'s count. If (0,2) is a '1', that might help, but if it's a '2', that could complicate things. Or maybe I should look further down the board for a square that's less likely to be a bomb.\n\nWait, but since all the other squares are unexplored, maybe I should try to find a square that's adjacent to both (0,0) and (0,1) to see if it's a bomb or not. For example, (1,1) is adjacent to both, so if I could reveal that without it being a bomb, it would help me determine where the bombs are.\n\nBut revealing (1,1) could be risky because it might be a bomb. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's farther away, like (0,2), to see if it's a number or a bomb. If it's a number, that could help me figure out the adjacent squares.\n\nWait, but since I have 10 flags and 10 bombs, maybe I should start by placing a flag somewhere. But without any information, it's hard to choose where. Maybe I should wait until I have more revealed numbers before placing flags.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's in a corner or edge because they have fewer adjacent squares, making it easier to deduce if it's a bomb or not. For example, (0,9) is a corner, but it's unexplored. Revealing that might not help much because it's only adjacent to (0,8) and (1,8) and (1,9). But without knowing anything about those, it's still risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's in the middle of the board because it has more adjacent squares, so if it's a number, it might give me more information about the surrounding area. But again, without any info, it's a gamble.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a revealed number. For example, (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1), which is a '1'. If I reveal (0,2), and it's a '1', that would mean there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. But since (0,1) is already a '1', the bomb adjacent to (0,2) can't be (0,1), so it must be somewhere else, like (0,3) or (1,2) or (1,3), etc.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just start by revealing a square that's adjacent to the already revealed '1's to get more info. Let's consider (1,0), which is adjacent to (0,0) and (0,1). If I reveal (1,0) and it's a '1', that would mean there's one bomb adjacent to it. But since (0,0) is already a '1', the bomb for (0,0) must be in either (1,0) or (1,1). If (1,0) is a '1', then the bomb adjacent to it must be in one of its other adjacent squares, but that might not help much.\n\nAlternatively, if (1,0) is a '0', that would mean there are no bombs adjacent, which can't be because (0,0) is a '1'. So that can't be the case. Wait, no, (1,0) can't be a '0' because (0,0) is a '1', meaning there's a bomb adjacent to it, so (1,0) can't be a '0'. Therefore, revealing (1,0) would either be a bomb (which would end the game) or a number indicating how many bombs are adjacent to it.\n\nBut if I reveal (1,0) and it's a '1', that would mean there's one bomb adjacent to it. But since (0,0) is a '1', the bomb for (0,0) is either (1,0) or (1,1). If (1,0) is a '1', then the bomb for (0,0) must be in (1,1), because (1,0) is a '1', meaning it has one bomb adjacent, which can't be (0,0) because that's a '1' already. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since the board is mostly unexplored, perhaps the best move is to reveal a square that's adjacent to the most revealed numbers to get more info. For example, (1,1) is adjacent to both (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,2). If I reveal (1,1) and it's a number, that could give me information about multiple surrounding squares, which might help me figure out where the bombs are.\n\nBut again, revealing (1,1) could be risky because it might be a bomb. If I reveal it and it's a bomb, the game ends. But if it's a number, say '2', that would mean there are two bombs adjacent to it, which could be in any of the surrounding squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's not adjacent to any revealed numbers to avoid conflicts. For example, (2,2) is somewhere in the middle, but it's not adjacent to any revealed squares yet. If I reveal that, and it's a '0', that would mean no bombs around it, which could be useful. But if it's a '1' or higher, that would indicate bombs nearby, which could help in the future.\n\nBut again, without knowing, it's a gamble. Maybe I should just reveal a square that's in the top row or first few rows where I can get more info. For example, (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1), which is a '1'. If I reveal (0,2), and it's a '1', that would mean there's one bomb adjacent to it, which could be (0,3), (1,2), or (1,3). But since (0,1) is a '1', the bomb adjacent to it must be in (1,0) or (1,1), as I thought before.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should consider placing a flag instead of revealing. But I have 10 flags and 10 bombs, so I could start flagging where I think bombs are likely. But without any info, it's hard to choose.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's adjacent to both (0,0) and (0,1) to see if it's a bomb. For example, (1,0) is adjacent to both. If I reveal (1,0) and it's a bomb, the game ends. If it's not, then I know that the bomb for (0,0) must be in (1,1). But that's risky because I might hit a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, I could reveal (1,1), which is adjacent to both (0,0) and (0,1). If (1,1) is a '2', that would mean there are two bombs adjacent to it, which could be in (0,0) and (0,1), but (0,0) and (0,1) are already '1's, so that can't be. Therefore, if (1,1) is a '2', the bombs must be elsewhere, like (1,0) and (1,2), but that might not be the case.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just make a move that's less risky. Since the board is empty except for the first two rows, maybe I should reveal a square that's farther away from the revealed '1's to avoid potential bombs. For example, revealing (5,5) is in the middle, but it's not adjacent to any revealed squares yet. If it's a '0', that's safe. If it's a number, it might help in the future.\n\nBut again, without any info, it's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe I should just flag a square that's not adjacent to any revealed numbers, so I can start using my flags without causing conflicts. For example, (9,9) is a corner, so flagging it might be safe if it's a bomb. But I don't know if it's a bomb yet.\n\nWait, but I have 10 flags and 10 bombs, so I can't afford to waste flags on non-bomb squares. I need to be precise. Maybe I should wait until I have more info before placing flags.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal a square that's adjacent to multiple revealed numbers to maximize the info I get. For example, (1,1) is adjacent to both (0,0) and (0,1). If I reveal (1,1) and it's a '2', that tells me there are two bombs adjacent to it, which could be in (1,0) and (1,2), but that might help me figure out where the bombs are.\n\nBut again, it's risky because (1,1) could be a bomb. If I reveal it and it's a bomb, I lose. So maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should just reveal a square that's adjacent to one of the '1's to see if it's a bomb or not. For example, (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1). If I reveal (0,2) and it's a '1', that would mean there's one bomb adjacent to it, which could be (0,3), (1,2), or (1,3). But without knowing, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (1,0), which is adjacent to (0,0). If (1,0) is a '1', then it would mean there's one bomb adjacent to it, which could be (0,0) is already a '1', so the bomb for (1,0) must be elsewhere, but I don't know.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should just make a move that's less risky, like revealing a square that's not adjacent to any revealed numbers. For example, (2,2) is somewhere in the middle. If I reveal that and it's a '0', that's safe. If it's a number, it might help in the future.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here. I think I need to make a move, even if it's risky. Maybe I'll go ahead and reveal (1,1). If it's a '2', that gives me info. If it's a bomb, well, that's a loss, but I have to take that risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (0,2), which is adjacent to (0,1). If (0,2) is a '1', then there's a bomb in one of its adjacent squares. But again, it's a gamble.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the number of flags I have. I have 10 flags and 10 bombs, so I can afford to place flags, but I need to be accurate. Maybe I should wait until I have more info before placing flags.\n\nBut since the board is mostly unexplored, perhaps I should start by revealing a square that's adjacent to the revealed '1's to get more info. Let's say I reveal (1,1). If it's a '2', that tells me there are two bombs adjacent to it, which could be in (1,0) and (1,2), for example. Then, I can use that info to guide future moves.\n\nBut again, revealing (1,1) could be a bomb, which would end the game. So maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's in a corner, like (0,9). If it's a '0', that's safe. If it's a bomb, then I can flag it. But I don't know yet.\n\nWait, but (0,9) is in the top row, which is mostly unexplored except for (0,0) and (0,1). Revealing (0,9) could give me info about the top row. If it's a '0', then I know the top row from (0,2) to (0,9) is safe. If it's a '1', that would mean there's a bomb adjacent to it, which could be in (0,8), (1,8), or (1,9).\n\nBut again, it's a gamble. Maybe I should just go ahead and reveal (1,1), knowing that it might be a bomb but hoping it's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just place a flag somewhere. Since I have 10 flags and 10 bombs, maybe I can start by flagging squares that are likely to be bombs based on the revealed '1's. But without more info, it's hard to choose.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the fact that (0,0) and (0,1) are '1's, so their adjacent bombs must be in specific places. For example, (0,0) must have a bomb in (1,0) or (1,1). Similarly, (0,1) must have a bomb in (1,0), (1,1), or (1,2). So maybe I can look for a square that's adjacent to both, like (1,1), and see if that's a bomb or not.\n\nBut again, revealing (1,1) is risky. If it's a bomb, I lose. If it's a number, it helps. Maybe I should take that risk to get more info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just place a flag on (1,1), but I don't know if it's a bomb yet. That could be a waste of a flag if it's not a bomb.\n\nWait, but I have 10 flags and 10 bombs, so if I place a flag on a non-bomb, I'm just wasting a flag. So I need to be careful.\n\nI think the best move is to reveal a square that's adjacent to the already revealed '1's to get more info. So, let's go with revealing (1,1). If it's a '2', that would mean there are two bombs adjacent to it, which could be in (1,0) and (1,2), for example. If it's a '1', then it would mean one bomb adjacent, but since (0,0) and (0,1) are already '1's, that might not be possible because each can only have one bomb adjacent.\n\nWait, no, each '1' must have exactly one bomb adjacent. So if (1,1) is a '2', that would mean two bombs are adjacent, which could be in (1,0) and (1,2). But (0,0) is a '1', so the bomb for (0,0) must be in (1,0) or (1,1). Similarly, (0,1) is a '1', so its bomb must be in (1,0), (1,1), or (1,2).\n\nIf (1,1) is a '2', then the bombs would be in (1,0) and (1,2), but (1,0) is adjacent to (0,0) which is a '1', so (1,0) can't be a bomb because that would make (0,0)'s count go to '2', which is invalid. Therefore, (1,0) must be a '0' or a number, but since (0,0) is a '1', (1,0) can't be a bomb because that would make (0,0) have two bombs adjacent, which is impossible. Therefore, if (1,1) is a '2', then (1,0) must be a '0' or a number, but that can't be because (0,0) is a '1'.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to lay this out:\n\n- (0,0) is a '1', so it has one bomb adjacent.\n- The possible positions for that bomb are (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1) is already a '1', so the bomb for (0,0) must be in (1,0) or (1,1) because (0,1) is a '1' and can't have a bomb itself.\n\nWait, no, (0,1) is a '1', so it must have one bomb adjacent. That bomb can't be in (0,0) because that's already a '1', so it must be in (1,0), (1,1), or (1,2). But (0,0) is a '1', so its bomb must be in (1,0), (1,1), or (0,1) is already a '1', so that can't be.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should just make a move and see.\n\nSo, after considering all that, I think the best move is to reveal (1,1) to see if it's a '2' or a bomb. If it's a '2', that would help me figure out where the bombs are. If it's a bomb, the game ends, but I have to take that risk to get more info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just reveal a different square, but I think (1,1) is a good choice because it's central and adjacent to both (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nSo, I'll go ahead and reveal (1,1). If it's a '2', that would mean there are two bombs adjacent to it, which could be in (1,0) and (1,2). But (1,0) can't be a bomb because (0,0) is a '1', so that would mean (1,0) is a '0' or something else, which can't be because (0,0) is a '1'. Therefore, the bomb for (0,0) must be in (1,1), which is (1,1).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So if I reveal (1,1) and it's a '2', then I know that the bombs are in (1,0) and (1,2), but (1,0) can't be a bomb because (0,0) is a '1', so (1,0) must be a '0' or something else. Therefore, the bomb for (0,0) must be in (1,1). So, if (1,1) is a '2', that's consistent.\n\nBut if (1,1) is a bomb, then the game ends, which I don't want. So, I think I should avoid revealing (1,1) for now and instead reveal a different square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (1,0), which is adjacent to (0,0). If (1,0) is a '1', then (0,0)'s bomb is in (1,0) or (1,1). But (0,0) is a '1', so (1,0) can't be a bomb, so the bomb must be in (1,1). Therefore, if I reveal (1,0) and it's a '1', that would mean the bomb is in (1,1), which I don't know yet.\n\nBut if I reveal (1,0) and it's a '1', then (1,1) must be the bomb for (0,0), but I don't know that yet. So, maybe I should reveal (1,0) to see if it's a '1' or a bomb. If it's a '1', then I know that (1,1) is the bomb for (0,0). But I don't know if (1,1) is a bomb yet.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should just make a different move. Perhaps I should reveal (0,2), which is adjacent to (0,1). If (0,2) is a '1', that would mean there's a bomb in one of its adjacent squares, like (0,3), (1,2), or (1,3). But without knowing, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just place a flag on a square that's likely to be a bomb based on the revealed '1's. But I don't have enough info yet.\n\nI'm stuck. I think I need to make a move, so I'll go ahead and reveal (1,1) to see if it's a '2' or a bomb. If it's a '2', that would help me figure out where the bombs are. If it's a bomb, well, that's a loss, but I have to take that risk to get more info.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The next move is to reveal the square at (1,1) to gain more information about the surrounding area and determine if it's a bomb or a number indicating adjacent bombs.\n\nMOVE: 1,1,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 . 1 . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. So, the board is 10x10 with 10 bombs. Currently, there are two revealed tiles: (0,0) and (1,1), both showing 1. The rest are unexplored, so it's pretty early in the game.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Minesweeper, the numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that square. So, the square at (0,0) has a 1, meaning there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares. Similarly, (1,1) also has a 1, so it has one bomb around it.\n\nLooking at the revealed tiles, (0,0) is at the top-left corner. Its adjacent squares would be (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). But since (1,1) is already a 1, the bomb adjacent to (0,0) must be in one of the other two squares: (0,1) or (1,0). But wait, (1,1) is a 1, so it has one bomb around it. Its adjacent squares include (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2). Since (0,0) is already a 1, the bomb that's adjacent to (1,1) can't be in (0,0). So, the bomb for (1,1) must be in one of the other surrounding squares.\n\nNow, considering that (0,0) and (1,1) both have a 1, their adjacent bombs might overlap. For example, if the bomb for (0,0) is at (0,1), then (1,1)'s bomb could be at (1,2) or (2,1), etc. But since we don't have any other revealed numbers yet, it's hard to tell exactly where the bombs are.\n\nThe player has 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total, so all bombs need to be flagged or all safe squares revealed. But since it's early, maybe revealing more squares could help. However, revealing a square could also hit a bomb, which would end the game. So, I need to be cautious.\n\nLooking at the board, the only revealed squares are (0,0) and (1,1). The rest are all unexplored. I should consider which squares to reveal next to get more information without hitting a bomb.\n\nIf I reveal (0,1), which is adjacent to (0,0), and if it's a bomb, the game ends. But if it's a number, say 2, that would give me more info. Alternatively, revealing (1,0) could help determine if that's the bomb for (0,0). But again, if it's a bomb, game over.\n\nAnother approach is to look for squares that are adjacent to both revealed 1s, which might help narrow down the bomb locations. For example, (1,0) is adjacent to both (0,0) and (1,1). If (1,0) is a bomb, then both (0,0) and (1,1) would have their required bomb adjacent, which fits because each shows a 1. But if I reveal (1,0) and it's a bomb, the game ends. If it's a number, say 2, that would indicate another bomb nearby.\n\nAlternatively, revealing a square that's not adjacent to any revealed numbers might be safer, but it might not give as much information. For example, revealing (0,2) could be safe, but if it's a number, it might not directly help with the current situation.\n\nWait, considering the critical flag placement rules, each number must have exactly the number of bombs adjacent. So, if I place a flag somewhere, I have to make sure it doesn't conflict with the numbers. But since there are no flags placed yet, I don't have to worry about that right now.\n\nSo, maybe the best move is to reveal a square that's adjacent to both (0,0) and (1,1), like (1,0). If it's a bomb, game over. If it's a number, it gives more info. Alternatively, revealing (0,1) could also help.\n\nBut since I don't want to risk hitting a bomb, maybe I should reveal a square that's less likely to be a bomb. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a square that, if it's a number, would give me more clues.\n\nWait, another thought: since both (0,0) and (1,1) are 1s, and they are diagonally adjacent, their adjacent bombs might not overlap. So, (0,0)'s bomb could be at (0,1), and (1,1)'s bomb could be at (1,2), for example. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's adjacent to only one of them, to see if that helps. For example, revealing (0,2) would only affect (0,0)'s possible bomb locations, as (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1) and (0,0). But again, if (0,2) is a bomb, the game ends.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Since it's early in the game, maybe it's better to reveal a square that's adjacent to one of the 1s but is less likely to be a bomb. Let's consider (1,0). If I reveal (1,0), and it's a 1, that would mean there's one bomb adjacent to it. But since (1,0) is adjacent to (0,0), which is a 1, that bomb could be (1,0) itself, but that can't be because (0,0) is a 1, meaning it has one bomb adjacent, which would be (1,0) if (1,0) is a bomb. But (1,1) is also a 1, so if (1,0) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s adjacent bomb count would be satisfied by (1,0). But wait, (1,1)'s adjacent squares include (1,0), so if (1,0) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s count is satisfied. But then (0,0)'s count would be satisfied by (1,0) as well. So, in that case, (0,0) and (1,1) both have their bomb at (1,0). But that's impossible because each can only have one bomb adjacent, and they can't share a bomb in their counts unless that bomb is adjacent to both. So, if (1,0) is a bomb, both (0,0) and (1,1) would have their required bomb, which is allowed because a single bomb can be adjacent to multiple squares.\n\nWait, but in Minesweeper, each bomb can affect multiple squares. So, if (1,0) is a bomb, then both (0,0) and (1,1) would have their counts satisfied. That makes sense. So, if I reveal (1,0) and it's a bomb, the game ends. If it's a number, say 1, that would mean there's another bomb adjacent to (1,0), but that might not make sense because (0,0) and (1,1) already have their counts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (0,1). If (0,1) is a bomb, game over. If it's a number, say 2, that would indicate another bomb nearby, but considering (0,0) is already a 1, that might conflict.\n\nWait, let me think again. (0,0) is 1, so it has exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. Those are (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). But (1,1) is a 1, so it can't be a bomb. So, the bomb for (0,0) must be either (0,1) or (1,0). Similarly, (1,1) is 1, so its bomb must be in one of its adjacent squares, which are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). But (0,0) is a 1, so it can't be a bomb. So, the bomb for (1,1) must be in one of the other squares.\n\nSo, the bomb for (0,0) is either (0,1) or (1,0). The bomb for (1,1) is in one of the other squares. If I can determine whether (0,1) or (1,0) is a bomb, that would help.\n\nSuppose I reveal (0,1). If it's a bomb, game over. If it's a number, say 1, that would mean there's another bomb adjacent to (0,1). But (0,0) is already a 1, so that might not be possible. Alternatively, if (0,1) is a 2, that would indicate two bombs adjacent to it. But considering (0,0) is a 1, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (1,0) could help. If it's a bomb, game over. If it's a number, say 1, that would mean there's another bomb adjacent to (1,0), but again, considering (0,0) and (1,1) are 1s, that might not be possible.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to both (0,0) and (1,1), which is (1,0). If I reveal (1,0), and it's a bomb, the game ends. If it's a number, say 2, that would mean there's another bomb adjacent to (1,0). But considering (0,0) is a 1, if (1,0) is a bomb, then (0,0)'s count is satisfied, and (1,1)'s count would need another bomb. So, (1,1) would have to have another bomb adjacent to it.\n\nAlternatively, if (1,0) is not a bomb, then (0,0)'s bomb must be at (0,1). Then, (1,1)'s bomb would have to be somewhere else, like (1,2) or (2,1), etc.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to reveal a square that's adjacent to only one of them to get more info without risking a bomb. For example, revealing (0,2) would only affect (0,0)'s possible bomb locations. If (0,2) is a bomb, game over. If it's a number, it could give more clues.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (2,1) would be adjacent to (1,1). If it's a bomb, game over. If it's a number, it could help.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the safest move is to reveal (0,1). If it's a bomb, I lose. If not, it might show a number that helps. Alternatively, revealing (1,0) could give more info, but again, it's risky.\n\nWait, another idea: since both (0,0) and (1,1) are 1s, and they are diagonally adjacent, their bombs must be in their respective adjacent squares that don't overlap. So, (0,0)'s bomb is either (0,1) or (1,0), and (1,1)'s bomb is somewhere else, like (1,2) or (2,1).\n\nIf I reveal (0,1) and it's a bomb, then (0,0)'s count is satisfied, and (1,1) must have its bomb elsewhere. But if (0,1) is not a bomb, then (0,0)'s bomb must be at (1,0), which would then require (1,1)'s bomb to be somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (1,0) could be the key. If it's a bomb, both (0,0) and (1,1) are satisfied, which is possible. If it's not a bomb, then (0,0)'s bomb is at (0,1), and (1,1)'s bomb is elsewhere.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing (1,0). If it's a bomb, I lose, but if it's a number, it could help. So, the move would be to reveal (1,0).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (1,0) to determine if it's a bomb, which would satisfy both (0,0) and (1,1)'s counts, or if it's a number, providing more information.\nMOVE: 1,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 . 1 . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
