The board is currently completely unexplored, with no revealed cells yet.\n\nSince I haven't made any moves yet, and the board is completely unexplored, my first move should be to reveal a cell. In Minesweeper, the first move is usually safe in most implementations (though the rules don't explicitly state this). \n\nA good starting strategy is to pick a cell that's not on the edge of the board, as edge and corner cells have fewer adjacent cells and thus provide less information when revealed. I'll aim for somewhere near the middle of the board.\n\nLet's go with position (4,4), which is near the center of the board.\n\nI'll reveal this cell with the move:\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nWhere:\n- 4 is the x coordinate (row)\n- 4 is the y coordinate (column)\n- false means I want to reveal the tile, not place a flag\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Move Analysis\n\nLooking at the board, I'm facing a completely unexplored 10x10 grid with 10 bombs hidden somewhere. Since this is my first move, I want to maximize my chances of gaining useful information.\n\nIn Minesweeper, a good opening strategy is to click near the center of the board rather than at the edges. This is because:\n\n1. Center squares reveal more adjacent cells (8 surrounding squares)\n2. Edge and corner squares reveal fewer adjacent cells (5 or 3 respectively)\n3. The center of the board statistically gives me better chances to start a large clearing\n\nSince the board is completely unexplored, there's no pattern analysis I can perform yet.

The potential bomb locations are at (0,0) and (0,9).\n\nLooking at the row 1:\n- Position (1,0) and (1,1) both show 1s. The potential bomb could be at (0,0), (2,0), or (2,1). Since (1,0) has only two adjacent unexplored squares (0,0 and 2,0), one of them must be a bomb.\n- Position (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), and (1,8) all show 1s. The potential bombs are in row 2, columns 5-9.\n\nLet's continue this analysis through the board...\n\nLooking at row 2:\n- Position (2,5) shows a 1, with possible bomb locations at (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), or (3,9).\n\nLooking at row 3:\n- Position (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) show 1s. \n- Position (3,4) shows a 1.\n- Position (3,5) shows a 2, meaning there are 2 bombs in its adjacent tiles.\n\nLooking at row 4:\n- Position (4,2) and (4,4) show 1s.\n- Position (4,6) shows a 2.\n- Position (4,7) shows a 1.\n- Position (4,8) shows a 2.\n\nLooking at row 5:\n- Position (5,2) shows a 1.\n- Position (5,4) and (5,5) and (5,6) show 1s.\n- Position (5,8) shows a 1.\n\nLooking at row 6:\n- Position (6,2) shows a 1.\n- Position (6,8) shows a 1.\n- Position (6,9) shows a 1.\n\nLooking at row 7:\n- Position (7,2) shows a 1.\n\nLooking at row 8:\n- Position (8,0), (8,1), (8,2) show 1s.\n- Position (8,4), (8,5), (8,6) show 1s.\n\nLooking at row 9:\n- Position (9,4) shows a 1.\n- Position (9,6) shows a 1.\n\nNow, let's look for patterns and constraints to make deductions:\n\n1. Corner (0,0): \n   - Adjacent to (0,1) and (1,0) and (1,1), which all show 1s.\n   - This suggests (0,0) is likely a bomb.\n\n2. Corner (0,9):\n   - Adjacent to (0,8) and (1,8), which show 1s.\n   - This suggests (0,9) is likely a bomb.\n\n3. Bottom-left area:\n   - Position (9,0) is adjacent to (8,0) which shows a 1. \n   - Since (8,0) has adjacent revealed positions with no bombs, the bomb must be at (9,0).\n\n4. Let's look at (4,8) which shows a 2:\n   - Adjacent unexplored squares are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9).\n   - So 2 of these must be bombs.\n\n5. Looking at (4,6) which shows a 2:\n   - Adjacent unexplored squares are (3,6), (3,7), (5,7).\n   - So 2 of these must be bombs.\n\n6. Looking at (3,5) which shows a 2:\n   - Adjacent unexplored squares are (2,6), (3,6).\n   - So both of these must be bombs.\n\nBased on my analysis, I can confidently determine:\n- Position (0,0) is a bomb.\n- Position (0,9) is a bomb.\n- Position (9,0) is a bomb.\n- Positions (2,6) and (3,6) are bombs.\n\nNow, I need to make a decision about my next move. I should either:\n1. Place a flag on a definite bomb\n2. Reveal a safe square\n\nI think the most confident move is to flag position (0,0) as a bomb, since it's adjacent to three 1s.\n\nActually, I notice there's a constraint I missed:\n\nLooking at positions (3,5) and (4,6):\n- (3,5) shows a 2, indicating 2 bombs in adjacent squares. The only adjacent unexplored squares are (2,6) and (3,6).\n- (4,6) shows a 2, indicating 2 bombs in adjacent squares. The adjacent unexplored squares are (3,6), (3,7), and (5,7).\n\nSince (3,6) is common to both constraints, it must be a bomb. And if (3,6) is a bomb, then (2,6) must also be a bomb (to satisfy the constraint from (3,5)).\n\nAnd if (3,6) and (2,6) are bombs, then for (4,6)'s constraint, the remaining bomb must be either at (3,7) or (5,7).\n\nSo I'm confident that (0,0), (0,9), (9,0), (2,6), and (3,6) are bombs.\n\nI'll flag position (0,0) for my next move.\n\nActually, wait. Let me check if there are any safe squares I can reveal instead, which would be more informative.\n\nGiven the constraints I've identified, positions adjacent to the 1s in rows 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 that aren't likely bomb positions might be safe.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll go with flagging a definite bomb position. I'll flag position (0,0).\n\nEXPLANATION: Position (0,0) is adjacent to three 1s at (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1), making it a definite bomb location.\nMOVE: 0,0,true\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the current board, I need to identify definite bomb locations or safe squares to reveal.\n\n## Key Observations:\n1. Position (0,0) is adjacent to THREE '1' tiles at (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1)\n   - This means (0,0) must be a bomb since it's the only unexplored tile adjacent to all three of these '1's\n\n2. Looking at position (3,5) which shows a '2':\n   - It has only two unexplored adjacent squares: (2,6) and (3,6)\n   - This means both (2,6) and (3,6) must be bombs\n\n3. Position (9,0) must be a bomb:\n   - It's adjacent to (8,0) which shows '1'\n   - All other adjacents to (8,0) are already revealed as safe\n\nSince I know with certainty that (0,0) is a bomb, I'll flag it.\n\nEXPLANATION: Position (0,0) must be a bomb as it's adjacent to three '1' tiles at (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1), and these numbers would be impossible to satisfy otherwise.\nMOVE: 0,0,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n3 1 1 1 _ 1 2 . . . .\n4 . . 1 _ 1 . 2 1 2 .\n5 . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 .\n6 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n7 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n8 1 1 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 2, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nLet me analyze the current Minesweeper board state. I'll go through the revealed numbers and check for any obvious moves, and then make a decision based on the safest option.\n\nFirst, let's count the existing flags and see how many bombs remain:\n- There is 1 flag visible at position (0,0)\n- The game info says there are 10 bombs total, with 9 flags remaining\n- This means we've placed 1 flag already\n\nLet me go through the board and check the numbers:\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- Position (0,0) has a flag\n- Position (0,1) has a 1, which is satisfied by the flag at (0,0)\n- Position (0,8) has a 1, which might indicate a bomb at (0,9), (1,9), or (1,7)\n\nRow 1:\n- Position (1,0) has a 1, which is satisfied by the flag at (0,0)\n- Position (1,1) has a 1, which is satisfied by the flag at (0,0)\n- Positions (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8) all have 1s\n\nRow 2:\n- Nothing significant\n\nRow 3:\n- Position (3,0) and (3,1) both have 1\n- Position (3,4) has a 1\n- Position (3,5) has a 2\n\nRow 4:\n- Position (4,2) has a 1\n- Position (4,4) has a 1\n- Positions (4,6), (4,7), (4,8) have 2, 1, 2 respectively\n\nRow 5:\n- Position (5,2), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,8) have 1s\n\nRow 6:\n- Position (6,2) has a 1\n- Positions (6,8) and (6,9) have 1s\n\nRow 7:\n- Position (7,2) has a 1\n\nRow 8:\n- Positions (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6) have 1s\n\nRow 9:\n- Position (9,4) has a 1\n- Position (9,6) has a 1\n\nLet's look for obvious constraints and see if we can identify any safe moves or places where we need to put flags.\n\nLet's look at position (0,8) which has a 1. It's adjacent to unexplored spaces at (0,9), (1,9). Since there's a 1 here, one of those must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at position (6,8) which has a 1. Its adjacent unexplored spaces are at (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). Since there's only 1, only one of those can be a bomb.\n\nLet's also look at position (6,9) which has a 1. Its adjacent unexplored spaces are at (5,9), (7,8), (7,9). Since there's only 1, only one of those can be a bomb.\n\nThe positions (6,8) and (6,9) share some unexplored neighbors, so there might be some information we can derive by considering them together.\n\nLet's check (5,8) which has a 1. Its adjacent unexplored spaces are at (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8).\n\nNow let's analyze combined constraints:\n- (6,8) has a 1, and its adjacent unexplored spaces are (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n- (6,9) has a 1, and its adjacent unexplored spaces are (5,9), (7,8), (7,9)\n\nSince (6,9) has a 1, and its adjacent unexplored spaces include (7,8) and (7,9), if one of those is a bomb, the other cannot be. And since (6,8) also has a 1, and its adjacent unexplored spaces include those same (7,8) and (7,9), there can't be bombs in both places.\n\nLet me try to find a definite safe move or a definite flag placement.\n\nI notice that (4,8) has a 2, and its adjacent unexplored spaces are at (3,9), (4,9), (5,9). Since there's a 2 here, two of those must be bombs.\n\nMeanwhile, (5,8) has a 1, and its adjacent unexplored spaces include (4,9), (5,9) and some others. So at least one of (4,9) or (5,9) must be a bomb.\n\nAlso, (6,9) has a 1, and its adjacent unexplored spaces include (5,9). If (5,9) is a bomb, then neither (7,8) nor (7,9) can be bombs, which would mean that (6,8)'s bomb must be in one of (5,7), (6,7), or (7,7).\n\nI'm trying to find a safe move, where we can be certain there's no bomb.\n\nLet's look at (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). These are adjacent to (8,6) which has a 1 and (9,6) which has a 1. So there should be exactly 2 bombs in this area.\n\nLet me try to reason through these constraints again:\n- (4,8) has a 2, and is adjacent to (3,9), (4,9), (5,9) - so 2 of these are bombs\n- (5,8) has a 1, and is adjacent to (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8) - so 1 of these is a bomb\n- (6,9) has a 1, and is adjacent to (5,9), (7,8), (7,9) - so 1 of these is a bomb\n- (6,8) has a 1, and is adjacent to (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9) - so 1 of these is a bomb\n\nIf (5,9) is a bomb, then it satisfies part of the constraints for (4,8), (5,8), and (6,9). This would mean (4,8) needs one more bomb, which must be at (3,9) or (4,9). Also, (6,9) would need no more bombs, meaning (7,8) and (7,9) are safe.\n\nHmm, I think I should look for simpler constraints. Let me check the corners of the board where there's more revealed information.\n\nLooking at position (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), and (9,3). These are adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), and (8,2) which all have 1s. So there must be at least one bomb among (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), and (9,3).\n\nLet me try an easier approach. Let's focus on areas where we have a lot of revealed information.\n\nPosition (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9) are unexplored. They're adjacent to (1,6), (1,7), (1,8) which are all 1s. This means there's exactly one bomb next to each of them, and there's likely at least one bomb among those unexplored cells.\n\nOne key insight: if I find a position that has a number N and exactly N unrevealed adjacent cells, then all those cells must contain bombs.\n\nLet me check for positions that have a number equal to the count of adjacent unexplored cells:\n\nThe position (4,8) has a 2, and it has 3 adjacent unexplored cells: (3,9), (4,9), (5,9). So I can't deduce anything definitive here.\n\nLet me check other positions that might have this property.\n\nI notice that position (7,2) has a 1, and its adjacent unexplored cells are at (6,3), (7,3), (8,3). So there's 1 bomb among these 3 cells.\n\nPosition (8,2) has a 1, and its adjacent unexplored cells are at (7,3), (8,3), (9,2), (9,3). So there's 1 bomb among these 4 cells.\n\nI'll try to find a safe move by combining constraints.\n\nI see that (3,5) has a 2, and its adjacent unexplored cells are at (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,5). So there are 2 bombs among these 5 cells.\n\nI see that position (2,3) is adjacent to (2,2) and (3,2) which are both unexplored, and also to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (3,3), (3,4) which are all revealed. Since the board square at (2,3) is unexplored, we can safely reveal it as none of the revealed adjacent squares hint at a bomb there.\n\nLet me double-check:\n- Position (1,2) is revealed and shows \"_\", meaning it's an empty revealed space with no bombs adjacent.\n- Position (1,3) is revealed and shows \"_\", meaning it's an empty revealed space with no bombs adjacent.\n- Position (1,4) is revealed and shows \"_\", meaning it's an empty revealed space with no bombs adjacent.\n- Position (3,3) is revealed and shows \"_\", meaning it's an empty revealed space with no bombs adjacent.\n- Position (3,4) is revealed and shows \"1\", meaning there's 1 bomb adjacent. This could be at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), or (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Since there's only 1 bomb adjacent, and there are multiple possibilities, we can't be certain about (2,3) yet.\n\nActually, it appears that (2,3) is unexplored, so I was mistaken there. \n\nLet me look more carefully.\n\nPosition (3,3) has a 1, and its adjacent unexplored cells are at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). So there's 1 bomb among these 3 cells.\n\nPosition (3,4) has a 1, and its adjacent unexplored cells are at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). So there's 1 bomb among these 3 cells.\n\nNotice that both (3,3) and (3,4) involve (2,3) and (2,4). Since each has a 1, and they share these unexplored cells, it's likely that either (2,3) or (2,4) is a bomb, but not both. This doesn't give us a definitive safe move yet.\n\nLet me continue scanning the board.\n\nI notice that position (6,3) is unexplored and is adjacent to (5,2), (6,2), (7,2) which all have 1s. This means there's at least one bomb nearby, and (6,3) might be a bomb.\n\nI also notice that position (9,3) is unexplored and is adjacent to (8,2), (9,2) which have 1s. This means there's at least one bomb nearby, and (9,3) might be a bomb.\n\nI'm trying to find a position where I can be certain there's no bomb.\n\nI think I'll try a slightly different approach. Let me see if there are any numbers on the board that are \"satisfied\" by the flags already placed, which would mean that the other adjacent unexplored cells are safe.\n\nSince there's only one flag placed at (0,0), the numbers (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1) are satisfied, which means that any adjacent unexplored cells to these numbers are safe.\n\nSo let's check:\n- Position (0,1) has a 1, and the flag at (0,0) satisfies this. Adjacent unexplored cells are at (0,2), which is safe.\n- Position (1,0) has a 1, and the flag at (0,0) satisfies this. There are no adjacent unexplored cells.\n- Position (1,1) has a 1, and the flag at (0,0) satisfies this. Adjacent unexplored cells are at (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). These are safe.\n\nSo I can safely reveal position (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), or (2,2).\n\nLet me double-check this.\n\nWait, let me carefully verify again. The flag is at (0,0). The positions with 1s that are adjacent to this flag are:\n- (0,1) - to the right of the flag\n- (1,0) - below the flag\n- (1,1) - diagonally below and to the right of the flag\n\nAnd indeed, each of these has a 1, which is satisfied by the flag at (0,0). So any other adjacent unexplored cells to these positions are safe.\n\nFor (0,1), the adjacent unexplored cell is at (0,2), which is safe to reveal.\nFor (1,0), there are no adjacent unexplored cells.\nFor (1,1), the adjacent unexplored cells are at (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2). These are all safe to reveal.\n\nSo I can safely reveal (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), or (2,2). I'll go with revealing (0,2) as my move.\n\nLet me double-check this. The 1 at (0,1) is adjacent to the flag at (0,0) and the unexplored cell at (0,2). Since there's only 1 bomb adjacent to (0,1), and we've already found that bomb at (0,0), the cell at (0,2) must be safe. So I'll reveal (0,2).\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Move Analysis\n\nLooking at the current board state, I need to find a safe move or identify a tile that must be a bomb.\n\nFirst, let me check numbers that are satisfied by existing flags:\n- Position (0,1) shows a 1, and it's adjacent to the flag at (0,0)\n- Position (1,0) shows a 1, and it's adjacent to the flag at (0,0)\n- Position (1,1) shows a 1, and it's adjacent to the flag at (0,0)\n\nSince these 1s are already satisfied by the flag at (0,0), any other adjacent unexplored cells must be safe.\n\nFor position (0,1), which shows a 1, the adjacent unexplored cell is at (0,2).
