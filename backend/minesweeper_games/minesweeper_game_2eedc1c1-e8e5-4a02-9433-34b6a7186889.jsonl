{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The board is completely unexplored, all squares are still dots. The game is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining. Since the entire board is hidden, there's no information to go on. The first move in Minesweeper is usually a safe click. Typically, players start by clicking the center or a corner, but since all squares are equally likely to be safe at the beginning, maybe the best bet is to click a corner. Wait, but in Minesweeper, the first click is always safe, right? So no matter where I click, it won't be a bomb. So maybe I should click the center to maximize the chance of opening up a larger area. Wait, but in some versions, the first click might generate the bombs after the first move, ensuring that the first click is safe. So in this case, since the board is all dots, the first move is safe. So I can choose any square. Let's pick the middle, maybe (5,5). That way, when revealed, it might show a number that gives information about surrounding squares. Alternatively, maybe a corner like (0,0) to start. But in standard Minesweeper strategy, starting in the middle can open up more space. Hmm. But since the board is 10x10 and there are 10 bombs, the density is low. So the first click is safe. Let's go with (5,5) and reveal it. That's the best move here.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The entire board is unexplored. The first move in Minesweeper is always safe.
