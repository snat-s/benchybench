{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current state of the board. The board is 10x10, and all the squares are unexplored, represented by dots. There are 10 bombs placed, and I have 10 flags remaining. Since no moves have been made yet, the board is completely blank except for the dots.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules of Minesweeper. The goal is to either reveal all the safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs. Each number on the board indicates how many bombs are in the adjacent eight squares. If I reveal a square with a number, I have to use that information to deduce where the bombs might be. If I hit a bomb, the game ends.\n\nSince the board is completely unexplored, I don't have any numbers to go on yet. All the squares are still hidden, so I have to decide whether to start by revealing a square or placing a flag. However, placing a flag without any information is risky because I might be flagging a safe square, which could lead to a loss if I run out of flags or if I have to remove it later.\n\nI remember that in Minesweeper, the best initial move is often to start revealing squares in the middle because it gives more adjacent squares to work with, making it easier to get numbers that can help deduce the locations of the bombs. Alternatively, some people start at the edges, but the middle usually provides more information early on.\n\nLooking at the coordinate system, the board goes from (0,0) at the top-left to (9,9) at the bottom-right. So, the center would be around (4,4) or (5,5). But since the board is 10x10, maybe starting at (4,4) is a good idea because it's the exact center.\n\nWait, but actually, in a 10x10 grid, the center would be between (4,4) and (5,5). So, perhaps starting at (4,4) is a good starting point because it's a central position and likely to have more adjacent squares, which could lead to more information once revealed.\n\nAlternatively, some strategies suggest starting in a corner, but I think the middle is better because it maximizes the number of surrounding squares. Revealing a corner would only give me three adjacent squares, which might not provide as much information early on.\n\nSo, my next move should be to reveal the square at (4,4). That way, I can get the first number and start building from there. Since all other squares are unexplored, this seems like a logical first step.\n\nI also need to consider the flag placement rules, but since I'm not placing a flag right now, that's not an issue. My main goal is to start revealing squares to get numbers that will help me figure out where the bombs are.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes, people click on a square that's likely to be a zero, which means no adjacent bombs, but in a 10x10 board with 10 bombs, the chance of hitting a zero on the first click isn't too high. But starting in the middle increases the chances of getting a number that can help me branch out.\n\nWait, but actually, in Minesweeper, the first click never hits a mine, right? Or does it? I think in some implementations, the first click is safe, but in others, it's random. The user didn't specify, so I can't assume that. So, revealing (4,4) might be risky if it's a mine, but without any information, it's as good as any other square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start by flagging a square, but that seems counterproductive because I have no information to base the flag on. It's better to reveal squares first to get numbers.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to reveal (4,4). That gives me the most potential for adjacent squares and starts the game off with a central point of reference.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Starting by revealing the central square (4,4) to maximize the potential for adjacent information and begin the game with a central reference point.\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 8, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs with 10 flags remaining. I need to decide whether to place a flag or reveal a tile, making sure not to conflict with the numbers already shown.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. I'll go through each row and see where the numbers are and how they relate to each other and the potential bombs.\n\nLooking at row 0: It starts with three dots, then a 1, and the rest are unexplored. The 1 at (0,3) means there's exactly one bomb in the surrounding 8 squares. Since the squares around it are mostly unexplored, I can't do much here yet.\n\nRow 1: It has a 3 at (1,1), which is high. That means there are three bombs around it. Then there are 1s at (1,3) and (1,4). Hmm, so around (1,1), there are three bombs. Let me check the surrounding squares. The squares adjacent to (1,1) are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Among these, (1,0) is a dot, (0,0) is a dot, (0,1) is a dot, (0,2) is a dot, (1,2) is a 1, (2,0) is a dot, (2,1) is a 2, and (2,2) is a dot. So, the 3 at (1,1) must have three bombs in these surrounding squares. But I don't see any revealed bombs yet, so maybe some of these are bombs.\n\nRow 2: At (2,1) there's a 2, which means two bombs around it. The adjacent squares are (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). From row 1, (1,1) is a 3, which is a number, so not a bomb. (1,2) is a 1, so also a number. So the bombs around (2,1) must be in the other squares. But I don't see any flags yet, so maybe I can't determine much here.\n\nRow 3: At (3,1) there's a 1. So only one bomb around it. The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Since (2,1) is a 2, which is a number, and (3,0) is a dot, maybe the bomb is somewhere else. Not sure yet.\n\nRow 4: At (4,1) there's a 1, and at (4,7) a 3. The 3 at (4,7) means three bombs around it. Let's check its adjacent squares: (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). Hmm, (5,7) is a dot, (5,8) is a dot, (4,8) is a 2, (3,8) is a 1, and (3,7) is a dot. So, three bombs must be in these squares. Not sure yet.\n\nRow 5: At (5,3) there's a 1. So only one bomb around it. The adjacent squares include (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Not sure where the bomb is.\n\nRow 6: At (6,2) there's a 2, and at (6,4) a 1, (6,5) a 1, and (6,6) a 1. Also, (6,7) is a 2. So, (6,2) has two bombs around it. Let me check its adjacent squares: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). (5,3) is a 1, so not a bomb. So the two bombs must be in the other squares. Maybe (5,1) or (5,2) or (7,1), etc.\n\nRow 7: At (7,2) there's a 1. So only one bomb around it. The adjacent squares include (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (6,2) is a 2, so not a bomb. So the bomb must be somewhere else here.\n\nRow 8: At (8,0) and (8,1) there are 1s, and at (8,5) a 1, (8,6) a 1, (8,7) a 1, (8,8) a 1, and (8,9) a 1. So, each of these 1s must have exactly one bomb around them. Let's look at (8,0): adjacent squares are (7,0), which is a dot, (7,1), which is a dot, (8,1), which is a 1, and (9,0), which is a dot. So the bomb around (8,0) must be in one of these. Similarly, (8,1) has adjacent squares including (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). But (7,2) is a 1, so maybe the bomb is around there.\n\nRow 9: At (9,9) there's a 1. So one bomb around it. The adjacent squares are (8,8), which is a 1, and (8,9), which is a 1, and (9,8), which is a dot. So the bomb must be in one of these.\n\nNow, looking for obvious conflicts. Let's check the numbers against existing flags. Wait, the board doesn't show any F's, so no flags are placed yet. So I don't have to worry about conflicting flags yet.\n\nNext, I should look for areas where numbers can help me deduce where bombs are. For example, if a 1 is next to a 2, maybe the 1's bomb is in a specific spot.\n\nLooking at row 8, there are multiple 1s. Let's look at (8,0). It's a 1, so only one bomb around it. The adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), and (9,0). (8,1) is also a 1, so it's possible that the bomb is in (7,0) or (7,1). But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at row 6, (6,7) is a 2, so two bombs around it. The adjacent squares include (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). (5,7) is a dot, (5,8) is a dot, (6,6) is a 1, (6,8) is a dot, (7,6) is a dot, (7,7) is a dot, (7,8) is a dot. So, two bombs must be in these squares.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a spot where revealing would give me more information. For example, if I reveal a tile that's adjacent to multiple numbers, it could help me figure out where the bombs are.\n\nLooking at (0,3), which is a 1. If I reveal the tiles around it, maybe I can find the bomb. But since it's in row 0, the adjacent tiles are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2) is a dot, (0,4) is a dot, (1,2) is a 1, (1,3) is a 1, (1,4) is a dot. So maybe the bomb is in one of these. But I don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for tiles that are surrounded by numbers, making them likely to be bombs. For example, if a tile is adjacent to two 1s, it might be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (2,3): It's an empty space. Let's see what's around it. (1,2) is a 1, (1,3) is a 1, (1,4) is a dot, (2,2) is a dot, (2,4) is a dot, (3,2) is a dot, (3,3) is a dot, (3,4) is a dot. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, looking at (1,3) which is a 1, its adjacent squares are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (0,3) is a 1, so that's a number, not a bomb. So the bomb around (1,3) must be in one of the other squares. But since (1,2) is a 1, which is also a number, the bomb can't be there. So maybe the bomb is in (0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), or (1,4). But without more info, it's hard.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a tile that's adjacent to a 1 and see if it's a good candidate to reveal. For example, if I reveal a tile next to a 1, and it's a bomb, the game ends. But if it's a number, it could help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a tile that's surrounded by multiple numbers, making it a likely candidate for a bomb.\n\nLooking at (5,5), which is a dot. It's adjacent to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (4,6) is a dot, (5,6) is a 1, (6,6) is a 1. So, maybe (5,5) is a bomb? But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can look for a tile that's adjacent to a 2 and a 1, which might indicate it's a bomb. For example, if a tile is next to a 2 and a 1, and those numbers require a bomb there.\n\nLooking at (2,4): It's a dot. Adjacent squares include (1,3), which is a 1, (1,4) is a dot, (1,5) is a dot, (2,3) is a dot, (2,5) is a dot, (3,3) is a dot, (3,4) is a dot, (3,5) is a dot. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe I should look for a tile that's adjacent to multiple numbers, so revealing it would give me more info. For example, (3,7) is a dot, adjacent to (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). (2,8) is a 1, (3,8) is a 2, (4,7) is a 3, (4,8) is a 1. So, revealing (3,7) might show a number that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a tile that's in a corner, like (9,9), which is a 1. If I reveal (9,8), which is a dot, maybe it's a bomb or a number.\n\nWait, (9,9) is a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (8,8), (8,9), and (9,8). (8,8) is a 1, (8,9) is a 1. So, if (9,9) is a 1, there's exactly one bomb among (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). But (8,8) is a 1, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. Similarly, (8,9) is a 1, so also a number. Therefore, the bomb must be at (9,8). So, (9,8) is a bomb. But wait, if I place a flag there, that would be correct. Since the user has 10 flags remaining, and there are 10 bombs, maybe that's a good move.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that placing a flag at (9,8) doesn't conflict with any numbers. Let me check the numbers around (9,8). The adjacent squares to (9,8) are (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), and (9,9). (8,8) is a 1, so it expects one bomb around it. If (9,8) is a bomb, then (8,8) would have that as one bomb, which is correct. (9,9) is a 1, which would also have one bomb at (9,8). So that works.\n\nSo, placing a flag at (9,8) seems correct. Let me check if any other numbers would be affected. For example, (8,7) is a 1. Its adjacent squares include (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). If (9,8) is a bomb, then (8,7)'s count is satisfied if there's another bomb elsewhere, but I don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a tile instead of placing a flag, to get more information.\n\nBut since I can place a flag at (9,8) without conflicting with any numbers, and it's likely a bomb, I think that's a good move. Also, since the user has 10 flags left and 10 bombs, it's a good opportunity.\n\nSo, the move would be to place a flag at (9,8).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (9,8) because it's the only possible bomb adjacent to (9,9) without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nMOVE: 9,8,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n3 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 .\n4 . 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 3 .\n5 . . . 1 _ _ _ 1 . .\n6 . . 2 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n7 . . 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n8 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 1 .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let's start by looking at the board and the information given.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10 with 10 bombs. There are 9 flags remaining, which means I can place 9 more flags if needed. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without hitting a mine.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice that position (9,9) is flagged, so that's one bomb accounted for. Now, I need to check other areas where numbers might help me deduce where the bombs are.\n\nStarting from the top, in row 0, there's a 1 at (0,3). Since it's a 1, it means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares. The squares around (0,3) include (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4). But I don't have much info there yet.\n\nMoving down to row 1, there's a 3 at (1,1). That means three bombs are around it. The surrounding squares would be (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). But again, not much revealed here.\n\nIn row 2, there's a 2 at (2,1) and 1s at (2,8) and (2,9). The 2 at (2,1) indicates two bombs around it. The surrounding squares are (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). Since (1,1) is a 3, which is a number, it's safe, so the bombs must be elsewhere around (2,1).\n\nLooking at row 3, there's a 1 at (3,1) and 1s at (3,2), (3,6), (3,7). The 1 at (3,1) suggests one bomb around it. The surrounding squares include (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Since (2,1) is a 2, which is a number, it's safe, so the bomb must be in one of the other squares.\n\nIn row 4, there's a 1 at (4,1), 1s at (4,2), (4,3), and a 2 at (4,7). The 1 at (4,1) has surrounding squares including (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Since (3,1) is a 1, which is a number, it's safe, so the bomb must be elsewhere.\n\nRow 5 has a 1 at (5,3) and 1s at (5,6), (5,7). The 1 at (5,3) is surrounded by (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Not much info here yet.\n\nRow 6 has a 2 at (6,2), a 1 at (6,3), and 1s at (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). The 2 at (6,2) means two bombs around it. The surrounding squares include (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). (5,3) is a 1, which is a number, so it's safe, so the bombs must be in other squares.\n\nRow 7 has a 1 at (7,2) and 1s at (7,4), (7,5). The 1 at (7,2) is surrounded by (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (6,2) is a 2, which is a number, so it's safe, so the bomb must be elsewhere.\n\nRow 8 has 1s at (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). The 1s here suggest each has one bomb around them. But since (9,9) is already flagged, maybe that's one of them.\n\nRow 9 has a 1 at (9,8) and the flagged F at (9,9). The 1 at (9,8) is surrounded by (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9). Since (9,9) is flagged, that's one bomb, so the 1 at (9,8) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. But (8,9) is a 1, which is a number, so it's safe, so the bomb must be at (8,8) or (9,7). But (9,7) is unexplored, so maybe that's where the bomb is.\n\nWait, but let's check the numbers again. The 1 at (9,8) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The possible squares are (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9). (8,9) is a 1, which is a number, so it's safe. (9,9) is flagged, so that's one bomb. So the 1 at (9,8) is satisfied because (9,9) is a bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares must not have any bombs. So (8,7), (8,8), and (9,7) must be safe. That means I can safely reveal (9,7) because it's adjacent to a 1 which is already accounted for by the flag at (9,9).\n\nSo, the next move would be to reveal (9,7). Since it's unexplored and we've deduced it's safe, revealing it will help open up more of the board.\n\nWait, but I should also check if placing a flag somewhere makes more sense. Since I have 9 flags remaining and only one bomb is already flagged, I have 9 more to place. But maybe revealing is better to get more info.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8, the 1s there: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), etc. Each of these has one bomb adjacent. Since (9,9) is flagged, maybe some of these 1s are pointing to that. For example, (8,9) is a 1, which is adjacent to (9,9), so that's accounted for. Similarly, (8,8) is a 1, but it's adjacent to (9,8) which is a 1, so maybe (8,8) is safe because (9,8)'s bomb is already at (9,9). Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nBut going back to (9,7), since (9,8) is a 1 and (9,9) is a bomb, (9,7) must be safe. So revealing (9,7) is a good move because it's definitely safe and will help uncover more of the board.\n\nSo, the move would be to reveal (9,7).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (9,7) because it's adjacent to a 1 at (9,8) which is already satisfied by the flag at (9,9), making (9,7) safe to reveal.\nMOVE: 9,7,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n3 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 .\n4 . 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 3 .\n5 . . . 1 _ _ _ 1 . .\n6 . . 2 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n7 . . 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n8 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 1 .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ F .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 9, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current board state and the game info to understand where I can make a safe move.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I've already placed 9 flags, so I have one flag left. I need to be careful because if I place a flag incorrectly, it might conflict with the numbers already revealed.\n\nLooking at the board, I see several revealed numbers. For example, at (0,3) there's a 1. This means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares. Let me check the surrounding squares of (0,3). The adjacent squares are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4). From the board, I see that (1,2) is 3, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (1,3) is 1, which is another number. So the bomb adjacent to (0,3) must be somewhere else. Maybe (0,4) or (1,4), but those are still unexplored. I don't see any flags around (0,3), so that's okay for now.\n\nNext, looking at row 1, column 1 is 3. That means there are three bombs around it. The surrounding squares include (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). I know (0,0) is unexplored, (0,1) is unexplored, (0,2) is 1, (1,0) is unexplored, (1,2) is 3, (2,0) is 2, (2,1) is unexplored, (2,2) is unexplored. So, the three bombs must be somewhere in these areas. I don't see any flags around here yet, so maybe I can come back to this later.\n\nMoving to row 2, column 0 is 2. The surrounding squares are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). (1,0) is unexplored, (1,1) is 3, (2,1) is unexplored, (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 1. So two bombs are around here. I don't see any flags in this area, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0 is 1. The surrounding squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is 2, (2,1) is unexplored, (3,1) is 1, (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is 1. So one bomb is around here. Again, no flags nearby, so that's okay.\n\nRow 4, column 0 is 1. Surrounding squares are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is unexplored, (4,1) is 1, (5,0) is unexplored, (5,1) is 1. So one bomb is around here. No flags, so no issue.\n\nRow 5, column 3 is 1. Surrounding squares include (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (5,3) is 1, so one bomb around here. No flags nearby, so that's fine.\n\nRow 6, column 2 is 2. Surrounding squares are (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). (5,1) is unexplored, (5,2) is unexplored, (5,3) is 1, (6,1) is unexplored, (6,3) is 1, (7,1) is 1, (7,2) is unexplored, (7,3) is unexplored. So two bombs here. No flags nearby, so that's okay.\n\nRow 7, column 2 is 1. Surrounding squares include (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (6,1) is unexplored, (6,2) is 2, (6,3) is 1, (7,1) is 1, (7,3) is unexplored, (8,1) is 1, (8,2) is 1, (8,3) is 1. So one bomb here. No flags, so no problem.\n\nRow 8, column 0 is 1. Surrounding squares are (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1). (7,0) is unexplored, (7,1) is 1, (8,1) is 1, (9,0) is unexplored, (9,1) is unexplored. So one bomb around here. No flags nearby.\n\nRow 9, column 8 is F, which is a flag. So that's one bomb accounted for.\n\nNow, considering the critical flag placement rules, I need to make sure that any flag I place doesn't conflict with the numbers already shown. Since I have one flag left, I should look for a spot where placing a flag would satisfy the numbers around it.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice that at position (9,9), it's unexplored, but I don't have any information around it. Similarly, position (9,8) is flagged, so that's already a bomb.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that at row 8, column 9 is 1. So the square at (8,9) is 1, meaning there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. The surrounding squares include (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9). (7,8) is unexplored, (7,9) is unexplored, (8,8) is 1, (9,8) is F, and (9,9) is unexplored. Since (9,8) is already a flag, that counts as the one bomb adjacent to (8,9). Therefore, the other surrounding squares cannot have any more bombs because the number is 1. So, (7,8), (7,9), (9,9) must be safe. \n\nTherefore, (9,9) must be a safe square because it's adjacent to a 1 at (8,9) and there's already a flag at (9,8). So, revealing (9,9) should be safe. Alternatively, since I have one flag left, maybe I can place a flag somewhere else, but I need to make sure it doesn't conflict.\n\nWait, but (9,9) is at the bottom-right corner. Let me check the surrounding squares again. (8,9) is 1, and (9,8) is F. So, the bomb is at (9,8), so (9,9) is safe. Therefore, I can safely reveal (9,9) without worrying about hitting a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for another spot where a flag can be placed without conflicting. Let me see. At row 0, column 9 is unexplored. The surrounding squares include (0,8), which is unexplored, and (1,8), which is 3. Wait, (1,8) is 3, meaning three bombs around it. The surrounding squares of (1,8) are (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). (0,7) is unexplored, (0,8) is unexplored, (0,9) is unexplored, (1,7) is unexplored, (1,9) is unexplored, (2,7) is unexplored, (2,8) is 1, (2,9) is 1. So, three bombs around (1,8). I don't see any flags here, so maybe placing a flag at (0,9) would be possible, but I need to check if it's allowed.\n\nWait, but (1,8) is 3, so three bombs around it. If I place a flag at (0,9), that would count as one bomb. Then, I need to check if the other surrounding squares can have two more bombs without conflicting with other numbers. For example, (2,8) is 1, so only one bomb around it. If (0,9) is a bomb, then (2,8) would have one bomb accounted for, so the other surrounding squares of (2,8) must not have any more bombs. But this might get complicated. Maybe it's safer to reveal (9,9) since I'm certain it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, column 5 is unexplored. The surrounding squares include (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (4,4) is unexplored, (4,5) is unexplored, (4,6) is unexplored, (5,4) is unexplored, (5,6) is unexplored, (6,4) is 1, (6,5) is unexplored, (6,6) is 2. So, (6,6) is 2, meaning two bombs around it. If I place a flag at (5,5), would that interfere? I'm not sure. It might be better to avoid this area for now.\n\nLooking back, I think the safest move is to reveal (9,9) because it's adjacent to a 1 at (8,9) and a flag at (9,8), so it must be safe. Revealing it would also help me see if there are any numbers there, which might give me more information for future moves.\n\nSo, my next move should be to reveal (9,9). That way, I can safely open it without worrying about hitting a bomb, and it might reveal a number that helps with the rest of the board.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (9,9) is safe because it's adjacent to a 1 at (8,9) and a flag at (9,8), ensuring no bomb is present there.\nMOVE: 9,9,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n3 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 .\n4 . 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 3 .\n5 . . . 1 _ _ _ 1 . .\n6 . . 2 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n7 . . 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n8 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 1 .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ F .", "sucess": false}
