Examine Revealed Numbers and Existing Flags:\n- Each '1' and '2' on the board indicates a specific requirement for adjacent bombs, which can lead us to flag placement.\n- Checking individual numbers next to existing _ or . (unexplored spaces) and any flags that are already placed helps us analyze where potential bombs are.\n\n#### Conflicts:\nLet's look for conflicts:\n- The '1's at (0,1), (0,6), (1,1), (1,6), and (3,1) have no flags adjacent to them. So there's room for potential bomb placements around them.\n- The '2's at (2,1) and (4,2) require further examination. The '2' at (2,1) is already adjacent to the flagged space at (0,1), meaning it must have one flag in its neighbors but still needs another bomb. The other adjacent unexplored spaces can hold the second bomb.\n\n### Observing Adjacent Boards\nThe two '2's definitely influence the space around them. For the '2' at (4,2), if we count adjacent unexplored spaces:\n- Adjacent unexplored spaces to (4,2): (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). \n- Among these, (3,1) is adjacent and contributes to adjacent bomb counts.\n\n#### 2. Making a Decision:\n- Since we have the maximum flags available (10 flags remaining) and there is potential for ambiguity without a clear deduction of bomb placements based on existing numbers and flags, the best immediate move is to reveal a square.\n- There\u2019s a highly unexplored area within (5,5), as adjacent squares in that area appear safe. In particular, (5, 5) does not violate the adjacent bomb numbers.\n\n### Final Decision:\nBased on this analysis, I propose the following action:\n\n### Explanation:\nTo explore safe spaces that are not directly adjacent to existing flags or where bombs must not conflict with adjacent numbers. I\u2019ll reveal (5,5) for a safer check rather than placing more flags now.\n\n### Move:\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . . . 1 _ _ _\n1 _ 1 . . . . 1 _ _ _\n2 _ 2 . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n3 _ 1 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ 1 2 2 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n7 _ _ _ _ 1 2 2 2 . .\n8 _ _ _ 1 2 . . . . .\n9 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Specifically, we will look at how many adjacent bombs there are for each number and where flags might be placed or need to be removed.\n\n2. **Reviewing Numbers and Flags**:\n   - The board has a set of revealed numbered squares indicating adjacent bombs and a certain number of flags placed around them. We need to check for any conflicts based on the current flags.\n\n3. **Checking Each Number**:\n   - Let's review the crucial numbers:\n\n   For example:\n   - Cell (4,8) shows 1: It has one adjacent flag (on (5,7)), thus it does not conflict, and no action needs to be taken around here.\n   - Cell (4,9) shows 1: It is adjacent to one unknown square (5,9) and does not conflict with flags.\n   - Cell (3,0) shows 1: No adjacent flags, potential to flag (3,1) or (4,0).\n   - Cell (2,2) shows 3 and is already surrounded by 2 flags (at (1,2) (1,3)). Therefore, we need to flag one of the unknowns adjacent to (2,3) or (3,2).\n\n4. **Available Flags**:\n   - There are 10 flags remaining. We need to decide on placing flags or revealing more squares.\n\n### Next Move\n\nWe can confidently place a flag at (3, 2) because:\n- There\u2019s a '3' at (2, 2) indicating it needs exactly three bombs. Given it only has 2 adjacent flags already and needs one more bomb flagged between (2,1), (3,1) or (3,2), placing the flag here is safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on this analysis, the next move will be to place a flag on (3, 2).\n\nEXPLANATION: I am placing a flag at (3, 2) because the adjacent number (2, 2) shows 3, and it currently has 2 adjacent flags.
