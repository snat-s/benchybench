{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 1, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs, and I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: Starting the game by revealing the center square, which is safe.\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after revealing (4,4), the board shows a '1'. That means there's exactly one bomb adjacent to this square. The adjacent squares are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5).\n\nSince it's my first move and I just revealed one square, I don't have any other information yet. So, I need to explore more to find out where the bomb is.\n\nNext, I can try revealing another square that's not adjacent to the first one to maximize the area I'm exploring. Let's say I choose (2,2).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another square to expand the known area.\nMOVE: 2,2,false\n\nAssuming that (2,2) is also a '1', now I have two separate '1's on the board. I need to look at their adjacent squares to see if there's any overlap in potential bomb locations.\n\nLet's list the adjacent squares for both '1's:\n\n- (4,4): Adjacent squares are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\n- (2,2): Adjacent squares are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nNotice that (3,3) is adjacent to both '1's. This is interesting because if there's a bomb in (3,3), it would satisfy both '1's. However, since both '1's are indicating only one bomb each, having a bomb in (3,3) would mean that no other bombs are adjacent to either (4,4) or (2,2).\n\nBut wait, if (3,3) has a bomb, then (3,4), (4,3), etc., cannot have bombs because (4,4) already has its one adjacent bomb in (3,3). Similarly, (3,2), (2,3), etc., cannot have bombs because (2,2) has its one adjacent bomb in (3,3).\n\nSo, in this scenario, (3,3) is likely to be a bomb. But I need to confirm this by revealing more squares.\n\nNext, I can try revealing a square that's adjacent to one of the '1's but not overlapping with the other '1's adjacent squares. For example, I can reveal (4,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a square adjacent to the first '1' to get more information.\nMOVE: 4,5,false\n\nAssuming that (4,5) reveals a '0', which means there are no adjacent bombs. So, it will automatically reveal the surrounding squares.\n\nNow, the board might look like this:\n\n- (4,5) is '0', and it reveals (3,5), (4,6), (5,5), (5,6), etc., all as '0's or numbers based on adjacent bombs.\n\nFor the sake of this example, let's say revealing (4,5) as '0' reveals a cluster of '0's, expanding the board.\n\nNow, focusing back on (3,3), which is adjacent to both '1's. If (3,3) is a bomb, then all other adjacent squares to both '1's should be safe.\n\nI can try revealing (3,4), which is adjacent to (4,4), to check if it's safe.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a square adjacent to the first '1' to check for safety.\nMOVE: 3,4,false\n\nAssuming (3,4) reveals a '0', which again expands the board.\n\nNow, with this expansion, if (3,3) is indeed a bomb, then the '1's are satisfied, and I can start placing flags on (3,3).\n\nBut before placing a flag, I need to make sure that it doesn't conflict with any other numbers.\n\nLet's say that after revealing (3,4), I see that (3,4) is '0', and it reveals (2,4), (3,5), etc., as '0's.\n\nNow, looking back at (2,2), which is a '1', and its adjacent squares are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nOut of these, (3,3) is still unrevealed, and if I place a flag there, it would satisfy the '1' for (2,2). Similarly, for (4,4), placing a flag on (3,3) would satisfy its '1' as well.\n\nSo, it seems logical to place a flag on (3,3).\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag on (3,3) as it satisfies both adjacent '1's.\nMOVE: 3,3,true\n\nNow, I have placed one flag, and I have 9 flags left.\n\nNext, I need to continue expanding the board by revealing more squares.\n\nLet's choose a square that's not adjacent to any known bombs or numbers. For example, (6,6).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a new area to expand the known board.\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\nAssuming (6,6) is a '2', and its adjacent squares are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nI need to see if any of these adjacent squares are flagged or if I can deduce anything about them.\n\nCurrently, (5,5) might be revealed or not. If (5,5) is revealed and shows a number, that can give me more information.\n\nFor now, since I don't have information about (5,5), I'll reveal another square.\n\nLet's reveal (6,7).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a square adjacent to the new '2' to get more information.\nMOVE: 6,7,false\n\nAssuming (6,7) reveals a '1', and its adjacent squares are (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8).\n\nNow, (6,6) is a '2', and (6,7) is a '1'. If I look at their overlapping adjacent squares, which are (5,6), (5,7), (6,6), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7), I need to see if I can deduce anything about potential bombs.\n\nGiven that (6,6) is '2', meaning two bombs adjacent, and (6,7) is '1', meaning one bomb adjacent.\n\nIf there are two bombs adjacent to (6,6) and only one adjacent to (6,7), then the bombs must be placed in such a way that they satisfy both conditions.\n\nLet's consider the squares (5,6), (5,7), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nIf I assume that (5,6) and (7,6) are bombs, then (6,6) would have two adjacent bombs, and (6,7) would have one adjacent bomb in (5,7) or (7,7). But this might not satisfy both conditions.\n\nI need to think carefully.\n\nLet's say (5,7) and (7,7) are bombs. Then, (6,6) would have two adjacent bombs, satisfying its '2', and (6,7) would have one adjacent bomb, satisfying its '1'.\n\nAlternatively, (5,6) and (7,7) could be bombs, making (6,6) see two bombs and (6,7) see one bomb.\n\nI need more information to decide.\n\nPerhaps I should reveal another square, like (7,6).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another square to get more information about the potential bomb locations.\nMOVE: 7,6,false\n\nAssuming (7,6) reveals a '0', which expands the board by revealing (6,6), (7,5), (7,7), (8,6), etc., as '0's or numbers.\n\nNow, if (7,6) is '0', and it reveals surrounding squares, perhaps (6,6) is already revealed as '2', and (7,7) is revealed as '1', and so on.\n\nWith this expansion, I might get a clearer picture of where the bombs are.\n\nAssuming that after revealing (7,6) as '0', it reveals a cluster of '0's, and now I have more numbers and safe squares.\n\nNow, looking back at the earlier flag I placed on (3,3), I need to ensure that it doesn't conflict with any new information.\n\nAlso, I need to keep track of the remaining flags. I have 9 flags left, and there are 10 bombs in total.\n\nAs I progress, I should mark flags only where I'm certain there are bombs, and use the numbers to deduce the locations.\n\nLet's say that after revealing several squares, I have a section of the board that looks like this:\n\n- (4,4) is '1', with flag on (3,3)\n\n- (2,2) is '1', with flag on (3,3)\n\n- (6,6) is '2', with flags on (5,7) and (7,7)\n\n- (6,7) is '1', with flag on (7,7)\n\nThis is just an example. I need to adjust based on actual reveals.\n\nContinuing this process, revealing squares and placing flags where necessary, while ensuring that the numbers match the adjacent flags, I can gradually uncover the board.\n\nIt's important to be cautious and not to rush into placing flags without sufficient evidence, as mistakes can lead to losing the game.\n\nSo, my next move, based on the earlier steps, would be:\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a new area to expand the known board.\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\nBut since I already assumed that (6,6) is '2', perhaps I should reveal another square.\n\nLet's try revealing (1,1).\n\nEXPLANATION: Exploring a new area to find more safe squares.\nMOVE: 1,1,false\n\nAssuming (1,1) is a '0', which reveals surrounding squares.\n\nNow, with this expansion, I might find more numbers or '0's, helping me to deduce where bombs are not present.\n\nContinuing in this manner, step by step, revealing squares and placing flags only when certain, I can progress through the game.\n\nIt's also helpful to keep track of the number of remaining flags versus the number of unexplored squares in potentially dangerous areas.\n\nFor example, if I have a group of unexplored squares around a '1', and there's only one remaining flag, it's likely that the single unflagged square in that group is a bomb.\n\nBut I need to be careful with such assumptions, ensuring that there are no other possible configurations that could satisfy the numbers.\n\nMinesweeper requires patience and logical deduction. By carefully analyzing the numbers and the positions of flags, I can increase my chances of winning the game.\n\nSo, for now, I'll continue to reveal squares in unexplored areas to expand my knowledge of the board.\n\nEXPLANATION: Continuing to reveal squares in unexplored areas to find safe spaces.\nMOVE: 8,8,false\n\nAnd so on, until the board is fully revealed or all flags are placed correctly.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this Minesweeper game, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Moves:**\n   - Start by revealing the center square to begin the game safely.\n     ```plaintext\n     EXPLANATION: Starting the game by revealing the center square, which is safe.\n     MOVE: 4,4,false\n     ```\n   - Reveal another square away from the first to expand the known area.\n     ```plaintext\n     EXPLANATION: Revealing another square to expand the known area.\n     MOVE: 2,2,false\n     ```\n\n2. **Analyze Revealed Numbers:**\n   - Look at the numbers revealed and their adjacent squares to deduce potential bomb locations.\n   - For example, if a '1' is revealed, and it has only one unflagged adjacent square, that square likely contains a bomb.\n\n3. **Place Flags Carefully:**\n   - Place flags only when you are certain a square contains a bomb, based on the numbers and existing flags.\n     ```plaintext\n     EXPLANATION: Placing a flag on (3,3) as it satisfies both adjacent '1's.\n     MOVE: 3,3,true\n     ```\n\n4. **Expand Safe Areas:**\n   - Continue revealing squares in safe areas to expand the known parts of the board.\n     ```plaintext\n     EXPLANATION: Revealing a new area to expand the known board.\n     MOVE: 6,6,false\n     ```\n\n5. **Use Logical Deduction:**\n   - Use the numbers and existing flags to logically deduce the positions of bombs.\n   - For example, if a '2' has two adjacent unflagged squares, both likely contain bombs.\n\n6. **Verify and Adjust:**\n   - Regularly verify that the placement of flags matches the numbers on the board.\n   - If a conflict is found, adjust the flags accordingly.\n\n7. **Proceed with Caution:**\n   - Always proceed with caution, revealing one square at a time and updating your deductions.\n     ```plaintext\n     EXPLANATION: Exploring a new area to find more safe squares.\n     MOVE: 1,1,false\n     ```\n\n8. **Track Remaining Flags:**\n   - Keep track of the remaining flags and ensure that the number of flags matches the number of unexplored bombs.\n\nBy following these steps and using logical deduction at each turn, you can successfully solve the Minesweeper game.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 0, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left to find, with 10 flags remaining. That means I need to flag all 10 remaining bombs to win.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the revealed numbers and see what they tell me about the surrounding squares. Let's start from the top left and work our way across.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Column 0: It's blank, so it's an empty revealed space.\n\n- Column 1: It's a '1', which means there's one bomb adjacent to this square.\n\n- Column 2: Another '1'.\n\n- Column 3: It's a '.', which means it's unexplored.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for areas where I can deduce the exact positions of bombs.\n\nLet's look at row 5, column 5: It's a '1'. Let's see the surrounding squares:\n\n- Above it: row 4, column 5: unexplored.\n\n- Below it: row 6, column 5: '1'.\n\n- Left: row 5, column 4: unexplored.\n\n- Right: row 5, column 6: '1'.\n\n- Diagonals: row 4, column 4; row 4, column 6; row 6, column 4; row 6, column 6.\n\nWait, but row 6, column 5 is a '1', and row 5, column 6 is a '1', and row 6, column 6 is a '1'.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's check row 2, column 3: It's a '3'. That means there are three bombs adjacent to it.\n\nLooking at the adjacent squares:\n\n- row 1, column 3: unexplored.\n\n- row 2, column 2: '.', unexplored.\n\n- row 2, column 4: '1'.\n\n- row 3, column 3: '1'.\n\n- row 3, column 2: '1'.\n\n- row 3, column 4: '.'.\n\n- row 1, column 2: '.'.\n\n- row 1, column 4: '.'.\n\nWait, actually, row 2, column 4 is a '1', which means there's one bomb adjacent to it. But it's also adjacent to the '3' at row 2, column 3.\n\nSo, the '3' has eight adjacent squares, and '1' at row 2, column 4 shares some of those.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look for a place where the number of unexplored squares matches the number needed for the bomb counts.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 9: It's a '1'. Adjacent squares:\n\n- row 2, column 9: '1'.\n\n- row 4, column 9: unexplored.\n\n- row 3, column 8: '2'.\n\n- row 3, column 10: unexplored.\n\n- Diagonals: row 2, column 8; row 2, column 10; row 4, column 8; row 4, column 10.\n\nWait, but row 3, column 10 is unexplored, and row 4, column 9 is unexplored.\n\nThe '1' at row 3, column 9 needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 9: unexplored.\n\nRow 3, column 10: unexplored.\n\nRow 2, column 9: '1'.\n\nRow 3, column 8: '2'.\n\nRow 4, column 8: unexplored.\n\nRow 4, column 10: unexplored.\n\nRow 2, column 8: '.'.\n\nRow 2, column 10: '.'.\n\nSo, the '1' at row 3, column 9 has several unexplored neighbors. But I need to see if I can determine where the bomb is.\n\nWait, maybe not immediately.\n\nLet me look at row 4, column 9: It's unexplored.\n\nRow 5, column 9: '1'.\n\nRow 6, column 9: '1'.\n\nRow 7, column 9: '1'.\n\nRow 8, column 9: '.'.\n\nRow 9, column 9: '.'.\n\nHmm, perhaps looking at column 9 could be useful.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 9: '1'.\n\nRow 6, column 9: '1'.\n\nRow 7, column 9: '1'.\n\nRow 8, column 9: '.'.\n\nRow 9, column 9: '.'.\n\nWait, row 5, column 9 is '1', and rows 6 and 7 are '1's as well.\n\nLet's see the surroundings of row 5, column 9.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- row 4, column 9: unexplored.\n\n- row 6, column 9: '1'.\n\n- row 5, column 8: unexplored.\n\n- row 5, column 10: unexplored.\n\n- Diagonals: row 4, column 8; row 4, column 10; row 6, column 8; row 6, column 10.\n\nWait, row 5, column 9 is '1', and row 6, column 9 is '1', which shares some adjacent squares.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nMaybe I should look for a place where the number of unexplored squares matches the number of bombs needed.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0: It's a '2'.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- row 0, column 0: empty.\n\n- row 0, column 1: '1'.\n\n- row 0, column 2: '1'.\n\n- row 1, column 1: '.'.\n\n- row 1, column 2: '.'.\n\n- row 2, column 0: '2'.\n\n- row 2, column 1: '2'.\n\n- row 2, column 2: '.'.\n\nSo, the '2' at row 1, column 0 has several unexplored neighbors.\n\nWait, row 1, column 1 is '.', row 1, column 2 is '.', row 2, column 0 is '2', row 2, column 1 is '2', row 2, column 2 is '.'.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I can consider that the '2' at row 1, column 0 needs two bombs in its adjacent unexplored squares.\n\nBut there are several unexplored squares, so it's not immediately clear.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a place with fewer unexplored neighbors.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0: It's a '1'.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- row 2, column 0: '2'.\n\n- row 4, column 0: unexplored.\n\n- row 3, column 1: '1'.\n\n- row 3, column -1: out of bounds.\n\n- Diagonals: row 2, column 1; row 4, column 1.\n\nSo, only row 4, column 0 is unexplored adjacent to it.\n\nWait, but the '1' at row 3, column 0 has only one unexplored neighbor, which is row 4, column 0.\n\nTherefore, there must be a bomb at row 4, column 0.\n\nSo, I should flag row 4, column 0 as a bomb.\n\nWait, but let's confirm.\n\nThe '1' at row 3, column 0 has only one unexplored neighbor, which is row 4, column 0.\n\nSince it's a '1', there must be exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nTherefore, row 4, column 0 must be a bomb.\n\nSo, I'll place a flag there.\n\nEXPLANATION: The '1' at (3,0) has only one unexplored adjacent square at (4,0), so it must be a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 4,0,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ 2 . . . . . . . .\n2 _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n7 . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 . . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board and trying to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. The board is 10x10, and there are 9 flags remaining, with 10 bombs in total. That means I've already placed some flags, and there's probably one more bomb that's not yet flagged.\n\nLet's look at the board:\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ 2 . . . . . . . .\n2 _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n4 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n7 . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 . . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n```\n\nSo, I have some revealed numbers and some flagged spaces. Let's start by focusing on areas where I can deduce the positions of the bombs with certainty.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Column 1 and 2 have '1's, and column 0 is empty. Column 3 and beyond are unexplored.\n\nIn row 1:\n\n- Column 1 has a '2', and column 0 is empty.\n\nIn row 2:\n\n- Columns 1 and 2 have '2's, column 3 has a '3', and so on.\n\nIn row 3:\n\n- Columns 1,2,3 have '1's, column 4 is empty, and column 9 has a '1'.\n\nIn row 4:\n\n- Column 0 is flagged, and column 9 has a '1'.\n\nIn row 5:\n\n- Columns 5,6,7,8,9 have '1's.\n\nIn row 6:\n\n- Columns 0,1,2 have '1's, column 5 has a '1', column 7 has a '1', and column 8 is empty.\n\nIn row 7:\n\n- Columns 2,5,6,7 have '1's, and the rest are unexplored.\n\nIn row 8:\n\n- Columns 2 has a '2', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nIn row 9:\n\n- Columns 2 and 3 have '1's, and the rest are unexplored.\n\nAlright, let's start by looking for obvious placements or removals of flags.\n\nFirst, look at row 4, column 0: it's already flagged. Is that correct? Let's check the adjacent numbers.\n\nAdjacent to (4,0):\n\n- (3,0): empty\n\n- (3,1): '1'\n\n- (4,1): empty\n\n- (5,0): empty\n\n- (5,1): empty\n\n- (4,9) has a '1', but that's far away.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look more carefully.\n\nActually, (4,0) is flagged, and (3,1) is a '1'. If (4,0) is a bomb, then (3,1) has one adjacent bomb, which would be (4,0). So that makes sense if there are no other bombs adjacent to (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (4,0) which is flagged as a bomb. So, no other bombs should be adjacent to (3,1). Let's see:\n\nAdjacent to (3,1):\n\n- (2,0): empty\n\n- (2,1): '2'\n\n- (2,2): '2'\n\n- (3,0): empty\n\n- (4,0): flagged\n\n- (4,1): empty\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\n- (4,1): empty\n\nSo, if (4,0) is a bomb, and (3,1) is '1', then there should be no other bombs adjacent to (3,1). So, (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (4,1), and (3,2) should not be bombs.\n\nWait, but (2,1) is a '2'. If (4,0) is a bomb, and (3,1) is '1', then (2,1) being '2' must have two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nAdjacent to (2,1):\n\n- (1,0): empty\n\n- (1,1): '2'\n\n- (1,2): '.'\n\n- (2,0): empty\n\n- (2,2): '2'\n\n- (3,1): '1'\n\n- (3,0): empty\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\nBut (3,1) is '1', which already has (4,0) as a bomb. So, (2,1)'s two bombs must be elsewhere. Maybe (1,0) and (1,2)?\n\nBut (1,1) is '2', which is already counted.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. The board is 10x10, and there are 9 flags remaining, with 10 bombs in total. That means I've already placed some flags, and there's probably one more bomb that's not yet flagged.\n\nLet's look at the board:\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ 2 . . . . . . . .\n2 _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n4 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n7 . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 . . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n```\n\nSo, I have some revealed numbers and some flagged spaces. Let's start by focusing on areas where I can deduce the positions of the bombs with certainty.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Column 1 and 2 have '1's, and column 0 is empty. Column 3 and beyond are unexplored.\n\nIn row 1:\n\n- Column 1 has a '2', and column 0 is empty.\n\nIn row 2:\n\n- Columns 1 and 2 have '2's, column 3 has a '3', and so on.\n\nIn row 3:\n\n- Columns 1,2,3 have '1's, column 4 is empty, and column 9 has a '1'.\n\nIn row 4:\n\n- Column 0 is flagged, and column 9 has a '1'.\n\nIn row 5:\n\n- Columns 5,6,7,8,9 have '1's.\n\nIn row 6:\n\n- Columns 0,1,2 have '1's, column 5 has a '1', column 7 has a '1', and column 8 is empty.\n\nIn row 7:\n\n- Columns 2,5,6,7 have '1's, and the rest are unexplored.\n\nIn row 8:\n\n- Columns 2 has a '2', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nIn row 9:\n\n- Columns 2 and 3 have '1's, and the rest are unexplored.\n\nAlright, let's start by looking for obvious placements or removals of flags.\n\nFirst, look at row 4, column 0: it's already flagged. Is that correct? Let's check the adjacent numbers.\n\nAdjacent to (4,0):\n\n- (3,0): empty\n\n- (3,1): '1'\n\n- (4,1): empty\n\n- (5,0): empty\n\n- (5,1): empty\n\n- (4,9) has a '1', but that's far away.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look more carefully.\n\nActually, (4,0) is flagged, and (3,1) is a '1'. If (4,0) is a bomb, then (3,1) has one adjacent bomb, which would be (4,0). So that makes sense if there are no other bombs adjacent to (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (4,0) which is flagged as a bomb. So, no other bombs should be adjacent to (3,1). Let's see:\n\nAdjacent to (3,1):\n\n- (2,0): empty\n\n- (2,1): '2'\n\n- (2,2): '2'\n\n- (3,0): empty\n\n- (4,0): flagged\n\n- (4,1): empty\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\n- (4,1): empty\n\nSo, if (4,0) is a bomb, and (3,1) is '1', then there should be no other bombs adjacent to (3,1). So, (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (4,1), and (3,2) should not be bombs.\n\nWait, but (2,1) is a '2'. If (4,0) is a bomb, and (3,1) is '1', then (2,1) being '2' must have two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nAdjacent to (2,1):\n\n- (1,0): empty\n\n- (1,1): '2'\n\n- (1,2): '.'\n\n- (2,0): empty\n\n- (2,2): '2'\n\n- (3,1): '1'\n\n- (3,0): empty\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\nBut (3,1) is '1', which already has (4,0) as a bomb. So, (2,1)'s two bombs must be elsewhere. Maybe (1,0) and (1,2)?\n\nBut (1,1) is '2', which is already counted.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look at another area.\n\nLet's look at row 5:\n\nColumns 5,6,7,8,9 all have '1's.\n\nLooking at these '1's, they are in a row, and they are adjacent to each other.\n\nLet's see their adjacencies.\n\nFor (5,5):\n\n- Adjacent: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nBut (4,5) is empty, (4,6) is empty, (5,4) is empty, (5,6) is '1', (6,4) is empty, (6,5) is '1', (6,6) is '1'.\n\nSimilarly for (5,6):\n\n- Adjacent: (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nAnd (5,7) is '1', (6,7) is '1'.\n\nIt seems like these '1's are all connected, and I need to find a way to determine where the single bomb is among them.\n\nBut I have to be careful not to assume things.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 6.\n\nIn row 6:\n\nColumns 0,1,2 have '1's, column 5 has a '1', column 7 has a '1', and column 8 is empty.\n\nLet's look at (6,0):\n\n- Adjacent: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\nBut (5,0) is empty, (5,1) is empty, (5,2) is empty, (6,1) is '1', (7,0) is empty, (7,1) is '1', (7,2) is '1'.\n\nWait, (6,0) is '1', so it has one adjacent bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is '1', so it has one adjacent bomb.\n\n(6,2) is '1', so one adjacent bomb.\n\n(6,5) is '1', one adjacent bomb.\n\n(6,7) is '1', one adjacent bomb.\n\nAnd (6,8) is empty.\n\nThis seems like a complex area. Maybe I should look for a place where I can deduce more clearly.\n\nLet's look at row 8:\n\nColumn 2 has a '2', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nAdjacent to (8,2):\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3)\n\nAll of these are either unexplored or have numbers.\n\nWait, (7,2) is '1', (7,3) is '1', (8,1) is unexplored, (8,3) is unexplored, (9,1) is unexplored, (9,2) is '1', (9,3) is '1'.\n\nSo, (8,2) is '2', meaning there are two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nLooking at the adjacent squares:\n\n- (7,1): unexplored\n\n- (7,2): '1'\n\n- (7,3): '1'\n\n- (8,1): unexplored\n\n- (8,3): unexplored\n\n- (9,1): unexplored\n\n- (9,2): '1'\n\n- (9,3): '1'\n\nNow, (7,2) is '1', which should have one adjacent bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (7,3) is '1', one adjacent bomb.\n\n(9,2) is '1', one adjacent bomb.\n\n(9,3) is '1', one adjacent bomb.\n\nSo, in this area, there are several '1's, each requiring one adjacent bomb.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can find a way to place flags here.\n\nLet's consider that (8,2) needs two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nPossible candidates are (7,1), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1).\n\nNow, (7,1) is adjacent to (7,2) which is '1', so if (7,1) is a bomb, that satisfies (7,2)'s '1'.\n\nSimilarly, (8,1) is adjacent to (8,2)'s '2'.\n\n(8,3) is adjacent to (8,2)'s '2'.\n\n(9,1) is adjacent to (8,2)'s '2'.\n\nAlso, (9,2) is '1', which needs one adjacent bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (9,3) is '1', needing one adjacent bomb.\n\nSo, let's think about possible bomb placements.\n\nIf I place a bomb at (7,1):\n\n- Satisfies (7,2)'s '1'\n\n- Also satisfies one of (8,2)'s '2'\n\nThen, I need another bomb adjacent to (8,2), which could be (8,1), (8,3), or (9,1).\n\nBut, (9,2) is '1', which needs one adjacent bomb.\n\nIf (7,1) is a bomb, then (9,2)'s bomb could be at (9,1) or (9,3).\n\nSimilarly, (9,3) is '1', needing one adjacent bomb.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's consider row 3:\n\nColumns 1,2,3 have '1's, column 4 is empty, and column 9 has a '1'.\n\nAdjacent to (3,1):\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nBut (2,1) is '2', (2,2) is '2', (3,0) is empty, (3,2) is '1', (4,0) is flagged, (4,1) is empty, (4,2) is empty.\n\nWait, (3,1) is '1', and (4,0) is flagged as a bomb.\n\nSo, (3,1)'s '1' is satisfied by (4,0), meaning no other bombs should be adjacent to (3,1).\n\nTherefore, (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (4,1), (3,2) should not be bombs.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal those squares.\n\nLet's check:\n\n- (2,0): unexplored\n\n- (2,1): '2' (already revealed)\n\n- (2,2): '2' (already revealed)\n\n- (3,0): empty (already revealed)\n\n- (4,1): empty (already revealed)\n\n- (3,2): '1' (already revealed)\n\nSo, (2,0) can be safely revealed, since it cannot be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (3,0) is already revealed as empty, so no issue there.\n\nWait, but (3,0) is already revealed as empty, and (4,0) is flagged.\n\nSo, perhaps I can look at (2,0).\n\nSince (3,1) is '1' and (4,0) is the bomb, (2,0) should be safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) should also be safe.\n\nLet me check (4,1):\n\nAdjacent to (4,1):\n\n- (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)\n\nBut (4,0) is flagged as a bomb, and (3,1) is '1', which is already satisfied by (4,0).\n\nSo, no other bombs should be adjacent to (3,1), which includes (4,1).\n\nTherefore, (4,1) should be safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) should also be safe.\n\nWait, but (4,2) is adjacent to (3,2), which is '1'.\n\n(3,2) is '1', and it's adjacent to:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nBut (3,1) is '1' with (4,0) as the bomb, so (3,2)'s '1' must be satisfied by another bomb.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n- (2,1) is '2', which needs two bombs adjacent to it.\n\n- (2,2) is '2', which needs two bombs adjacent to it.\n\n- (2,3) is '3', which needs three bombs adjacent to it.\n\n- (3,3) is empty.\n\n- (4,1) is empty.\n\n- (4,2) is empty.\n\n- (4,3) is empty.\n\nSo, (3,2)'s '1' must be satisfied by one of these adjacent squares.\n\nBut (2,1) and (2,2) are '2's, each needing two bombs adjacent to them.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look at another area.\n\nLet's look at row 5:\n\nColumns 5,6,7,8,9 have '1's.\n\nLooking at these '1's in a row, perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nLet's consider that each '1' needs exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\nThese '1's are connected, so the bombs must be placed in a way that each '1' touches exactly one bomb.\n\nLet's visualize this:\n\n(5,5): '1'\n\nAdjacent: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nBut (4,5) is empty, (4,6) is empty, (5,4) is empty, (5,6) is '1', (6,4) is empty, (6,5) is '1', (6,6) is '1'.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6): '1'\n\nAdjacent: (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nAnd (5,7): '1'\n\nAdjacent: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)\n\nAnd (5,8): '1'\n\nAdjacent: (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)\n\nAnd (5,9): '1'\n\nAdjacent: (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9)\n\nThis seems like a chain of '1's, and each '1' needs exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the bombs are placed in a way that each '1' touches exactly one bomb, and no two bombs are adjacent.\n\nThis could be a linear path of '1's with bombs placed offset.\n\nBut I need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a place where I can place a flag with certainty.\n\nLooking back at row 4, column 9:\n\nThere's a '1' at (4,9).\n\nAdjacent to (4,9):\n\n- (3,8), (3,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9), (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (7,9)\n\nBut (3,8) is '.', (3,9) is '.', (4,8) is empty, (5,8) is '1', (5,9) is '1', (6,8) is empty, (6,9) is empty, (7,8) is '.', (7,9) is '.'.\n\nSo, (4,9) is '1', meaning one of these adjacent squares has a bomb.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n- (3,8), (3,9), (5,8), (5,9), (7,8), (7,9)\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine exactly which one is the bomb.\n\nMaybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nWait, let's consider row 6, column 8:\n\nIt's empty, and adjacent to (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n\nBut (5,7) is '1', (5,8) is '1', (5,9) is '1', (6,7) is '1', (6,9) is empty, (7,7) is '1', (7,8) is '.', (7,9) is '.'.\n\nSo, (6,8) is empty, and it's adjacent to multiple '1's.\n\nPerhaps I can deduce something here.\n\nBut it's getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to look for a place where I can safely reveal a square without risking a bomb.\n\nLooking back at row 2, column 3:\n\nIt's a '3'.\n\nAdjacent to (2,3):\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nBut (1,3) is '.', (1,4) is '1', (2,2) is '2', (2,4) is '1', (3,2) is '1', (3,3) is '1', (3,4) is empty, (1,2) is '.'.\n\nSo, (2,3) is '3', meaning there are three bombs adjacent to it.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (1,2): maybe bomb\n\n- (1,3): maybe bomb\n\n- (1,4): '1' (one adjacent bomb)\n\n- (2,2): '2' (two adjacent bombs)\n\n- (2,4): '1' (one adjacent bomb)\n\n- (3,2): '1' (one adjacent bomb)\n\n- (3,3): '1' (one adjacent bomb)\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I can consider that (2,3)'s three bombs are among (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), since (1,4) is '1', which needs one bomb, and (2,2) is '2', which needs two bombs.\n\nBut it's not clear.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that (2,2) is '2', and it's adjacent to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nBut (1,1) is '2', (1,2) is '.', (1,3) is '.', (2,1) is '2', (2,3) is '3', (3,1) is '1', (3,2) is '1', (3,3) is '1'.\n\nSo, (2,2)'s '2' is likely satisfied by bombs adjacent to it, but it's connected to many other numbers.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for a place with fewer variables.\n\nLet's look at row 9, column 2:\n\nIt's a '1'.\n\nAdjacent to (9,2):\n\n- (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3)\n\nBut since the board is 10x10, row 10 doesn't exist, so only (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3).\n\nBut in the board, row 9 is the last row, so only (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3).\n\nSo, (9,2) is '1', meaning one of these adjacent squares has a bomb.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (8,1): unexplored\n\n- (8,2): '2'\n\n- (8,3): unexplored\n\n- (9,1): unexplored\n\n- (9,3): '1'\n\nNow, (8,2) is '2', which needs two bombs adjacent to it.\n\n(9,3) is '1', which needs one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nSo, for (9,2)'s '1', the bomb must be among (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), considering that (8,2) and (9,3) have their own bomb requirements.\n\nThis is still not giving me a clear indication.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the total number of flags remaining and see if there's a group where I can place the remaining flags.\n\nI have 9 flags remaining, and there are 10 bombs in total, meaning one bomb is not yet flagged.\n\nI need to be careful not to place a flag where there is no bomb.\n\nLooking back at the board, perhaps I can look for areas where the number of unflagged bombs is equal to the number of unexplored squares.\n\nFor example, if I have a '1' with one unexplored square adjacent, then that unexplored square must be a bomb.\n\nBut in this board, I don't see such obvious scenarios.\n\nWait, let's check row 1, column 1:\n\nIt's a '2'.\n\nAdjacent to (1,1):\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nBut (0,0) is empty, (0,1) is '1', (0,2) is '1', (1,0) is empty, (1,2) is '.', (2,0) is empty, (2,1) is '2', (2,2) is '2'.\n\nSo, (1,1)'s '2' is likely satisfied by bombs adjacent to it, but I don't see any unflagged squares here.\n\nWait, (1,2) is unexplored, but I don't know if it's a bomb or not.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is '2', which needs two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nThis is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability and choose a square that seems safer to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 0:\n\nIt's unexplored.\n\nAdjacent to (7,0):\n\n- (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n\nBut (6,0) is '1', (6,1) is '1', (6,2) is '1', (7,1) is '1', (8,0) is '.', (8,1) is '.', (8,2) is '2'.\n\nGiven that, (7,0) is adjacent to multiple '1's, which already have their bomb counts partially satisfied.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, column 8:\n\nIt's empty, adjacent to multiple '1's.\n\nPerhaps revealing (6,8) could be safe, as it's empty and surrounded by '1's that need their bombs placed carefully.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place a flag in a likely bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4:\n\nIt's unexplored, adjacent to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nBut these are all unexplored or have numbers.\n\nThis is getting too speculative.\n\nMaybe I should look back at row 8, column 2, which is '2', and see if I can deduce where its bombs are.\n\nAdjacent to (8,2):\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3)\n\nBut (7,2) is '1', (7,3) is '1', (9,2) is '1', (9,3) is '1', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nSo, (8,2) needs two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nPossible places:\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (8,1)\n\n- (8,3)\n\n- (9,1)\n\nBut (7,1) is adjacent to (7,2)'s '1' and (8,2)'s '2'.\n\nSimilarly, (8,1) is adjacent to (8,2)'s '2' and (9,2)'s '1'.\n\n(8,3) is adjacent to (8,2)'s '2' and (9,3)'s '1'.\n\n(9,1) is adjacent to (8,2)'s '2' and (9,2)'s '1'.\n\nSo, perhaps placing flags in two of these squares that don't conflict with the '1's.\n\nBut I need to make sure that placing a flag in one of these doesn't violate the '1's adjacent bomb count.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for me to decide confidently.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the safest move is to reveal a square that seems less likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 0:\n\n(7,0) is unexplored, adjacent to (6,0)'s '1', (6,1)'s '1', (6,2)'s '1', and (7,1)'s '1'.\n\nIf I reveal (7,0), and it's a bomb, that would contradict the '1's adjacent bomb counts, unless multiple '1's are adjacent to the same bomb.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps revealing (2,0), which is adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nBut (1,1) is '2', (1,2) is '.', (2,1) is '2', (2,2) is '2', (3,1) is '1', (3,2) is '1'.\n\nThis seems risky because of the cluster of numbers.\n\nMaybe I should try revealing (8,0), which is unexplored, adjacent to (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\nBut (7,2) is '1', (8,2) is '2', (9,2) is '1', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps revealing (6,8), which is empty, adjacent to multiple '1's.\n\nBut again, it's risky.\n\nGiven that I have 9 flags remaining and 10 bombs, and I've already placed some flags, perhaps I should consider that there are still bombs to be found.\n\nBut without more concrete deductions, I might have to make an educated guess.\n\nLooking at the board, perhaps the safest move is to reveal (7,0), as it's unexplored and not directly adjacent to any high-numbered tiles.\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** After analyzing the board, I couldn't find a clear indication of where to place a flag with certainty. Therefore, I've decided to reveal an unexplored square that seems less likely to be a bomb based on its adjacency to several '1's. This is a calculated risk, given the lack of definitive information for flag placements at this stage.\n\n**MOVE:** 7,0,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ 2 . . . . . . . .\n2 _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n4 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n7 . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 . . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see a 'F' at position (4,0), so that's where one flag is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. I'll start by looking at the revealed numbers and see if I can deduce where some bombs are.\n\nLet's look at row 0:\n\n0: _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1:\n\n1: _ 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2:\n\n2: _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n\nRow 3:\n\n3: _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 4:\n\n4: F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 5:\n\n5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\nRow 6:\n\n6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nRow 7:\n\n7: 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\nRow 8:\n\n8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 9:\n\n9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo, starting from the top-left, there are some revealed numbers and some unexplored spaces.\n\nLet me focus on the area around the flag at (4,0). Since it's a flag, there should be a bomb there. Now, looking at the '1's and '2's around it, I can try to see if there are any forced moves.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 1 and 2, both are '1's. The '.' at (0,3) is unexplored. Similarly, in row 1, column 1 is '2', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 2, where there are more numbers revealed.\n\nIn row 2:\n\nColumn 0: '_', which is revealed empty.\n\nColumn 1: '2'\n\nColumn 2: '.'\n\nColumn 3: '3'\n\nColumn 4: '1'\n\nColumn 5: '2'\n\nColumn 6: '1'\n\nColumn 7: '2'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nSo, at (2,1): '2', which means there are 2 bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nBut (2,0) is revealed empty, so no bomb there. (1,1) is '2', also revealed, so no bomb. (2,2) is '.', unexplored. (3,0) is '_', revealed empty. (3,1) is '1'. (3,2) is '1'. (1,0) is '_', revealed empty. (1,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, adjacent to (2,1), the possible bomb locations are (2,2) and (1,2), since the others are either revealed empty or have numbers.\n\nBut wait, (2,1) is '2', and it has two possible bomb locations: (2,2) and (1,2). So, both of these must have bombs.\n\nBut, hold on, there's a flag already at (4,0), which is below this area. Maybe I should consider that as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at row 3 and row 4 to see how the flag at (4,0) affects the numbers around it.\n\nIn row 3:\n\nColumn 0: '_', revealed empty.\n\nColumn 1: '1'\n\nColumn 2: '1'\n\nColumn 3: '1'\n\nColumn 4: '_'\n\nColumn 5: '_'\n\nColumn 6: '_'\n\nColumn 7: '_'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nIn row 4:\n\nColumn 0: 'F', flagged.\n\nColumn 1: '_'\n\nColumn 2: '_'\n\nColumn 3: '_'\n\nColumn 4: '_'\n\nColumn 5: '_'\n\nColumn 6: '_'\n\nColumn 7: '_'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nSo, the flag at (4,0) affects the '1's in (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), and (3,8), as well as possibly others.\n\nLet's look at (3,1): '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\n(3,0) is revealed empty, no bomb.\n\n(2,1) is '2', no bomb.\n\n(2,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(3,2) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(4,0) is flagged, bomb there.\n\n(4,1) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,2) is '_', revealed empty.\n\nSo, for (3,1): '1', and we know there's a bomb at (4,0), which is one of its neighbors. So, the '1' is satisfied, meaning there should be only one bomb in its adjacent squares, which is already accounted for at (4,0). Therefore, the other adjacent squares should be safe: (2,2) and (4,1), (4,2) are already revealed or safe.\n\nWait, but (2,2) is still unexplored, but since the '1' is already satisfied, it should be safe. So, maybe I can reveal (2,2).\n\nBut let me check another number to confirm.\n\nLooking at (3,3): '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(3,2) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(4,2) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(2,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(2,3) is '3'.\n\n(2,4) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(3,4) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,3) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,4) is '_', revealed empty.\n\nSo, for (3,3): '1', and we have a '3' at (2,3), which is adjacent to it.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the '3' at (2,3).\n\n'3' means there are 3 bombs adjacent to it. Adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n(2,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(2,4) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(3,2) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(3,3) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(3,4) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(1,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(1,3) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(1,4) is '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, for the '3' at (2,3), the possible bomb locations are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (2,2). That's four possible locations for 3 bombs.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that (2,2) might be safe based on (3,1):'1', but now the '3' at (2,3) suggests that (2,2) could be a bomb.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to look at more numbers to get a better idea.\n\nLooking at row 5:\n\n5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo, columns 5 to 9 have '1's.\n\nLet's look at (5,5): '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(4,4) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,5) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,6) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(5,4) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(5,6) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(6,4) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(6,5) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(6,6) is '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, for (5,5): '1', and all its adjacent squares are either revealed empty or '1's, except (6,6), which is unexplored. Since the '1' is already satisfied by one of the adjacent '1's, which are safe, meaning there must be one bomb in the adjacent squares. But all adjacent squares are safe except (6,6), which is unexplored. So, (6,6) must be a bomb.\n\nWait, but (6,6) is '.', unexplored. So, I should flag (6,6) as a bomb.\n\nBut hold on, let's see: (5,5):'1', and its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,4): safe\n\n- (4,5): safe\n\n- (4,6): '1', safe\n\n- (5,4): safe\n\n- (5,6): '1', safe\n\n- (6,4): '1', safe\n\n- (6,5): '1', safe\n\n- (6,6): unexplored\n\nSince all the '1's are safe, and the '1' at (5,5) needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares, and all adjacent squares are safe except (6,6), which is unexplored, then (6,6) must be a bomb.\n\nSo, I should place a flag at (6,6).\n\nBut looking back at the board, (6,6) is a '.', which is unexplored. So, I can place a flag there.\n\nAfter placing the flag at (6,6), I should update my count of remaining flags. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, but I'm placing one more, so flags remaining should be 8.\n\nBut according to the game info, flags remaining are 9, and bombs are 10. Since one flag is already placed at (4,0), and I'm placing another at (6,6), that would make two flags placed, but the flags remaining are still 9, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the flags remaining count doesn't subtract automatically. Maybe it's up to me to keep track of how many flags I've placed.\n\nIn that case, I've placed one flag at (4,0), and now I'm placing another at (6,6), so I've placed two flags, and the remaining flags should be 8, but the game says flags remaining:9. Maybe the flag at (4,0) wasn't counted correctly, or perhaps the game has a different flag count.\n\nAnyway, assuming that placing a flag reduces the flags remaining by one, then after placing a flag at (6,6), flags remaining should be 8.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll assume that the game will handle the flag count, and I'll proceed with placing the flag at (6,6).\n\nWait, but before placing the flag, I should make sure that it's indeed a bomb.\n\nLooking back at (5,5):'1', with adjacent squares all safe except (6,6), which must be a bomb.\n\nSo, it's safe to place a flag there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for more confirmations.\n\nLooking at (6,5):'1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n(5,4): safe\n\n(5,5): '1', safe\n\n(5,6): '1', safe\n\n(6,4): '1', safe\n\n(6,6): unexplored\n\n(7,4): '1', safe\n\n(7,5): '1', safe\n\n(7,6): '1', safe\n\nSo, for (6,5):'1', the only unexplored adjacent square is (6,6), which must be a bomb to satisfy the '1'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (5,6):'1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\n(4,5): safe\n\n(4,6): '1', safe\n\n(4,7): '1', safe\n\n(5,5): '1', safe\n\n(5,7): '.', unexplored\n\n(6,5): '1', safe\n\n(6,6): unexplored\n\n(6,7): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, for (5,6):'1', the unexplored squares are (5,7) and (6,7), but the '1' needs only one bomb in its adjacent squares. Since (6,6) is likely a bomb, and it's adjacent, then (5,7) and (6,7) can be safe.\n\nBut wait, (6,6) is adjacent to (5,6), so if (6,6) is a bomb, which satisfies the '1' at (5,6), then the other unexplored squares, (5,7) and (6,7), should be safe.\n\nBut (5,7) is '.', unexplored, and (6,7): '1', which is already safe.\n\nSo, perhaps I can reveal (5,7).\n\nBut before doing that, let's confirm that (6,6) is indeed a bomb.\n\nLooking back, from (5,5):'1', with all adjacent squares safe except (6,6), which must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,5):'1', with only (6,6) unexplored, which must be a bomb.\n\nSo, it's safe to place a flag at (6,6).\n\nAfter placing the flag at (6,6), I should update my mental map: there's a bomb at (4,0) and at (6,6).\n\nNow, looking back at row 2, column 3: '3'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nFrom earlier, (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) are unexplored, and (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) are safe.\n\nSo, for the '3' at (2,3), with three bombs adjacent, and possible bomb locations at (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (2,2).\n\nBut we already have a bomb at (6,6), but that's not adjacent to (2,3). So, that doesn't affect this.\n\nWait, but (6,6) is far from (2,3), so it doesn't help here.\n\nLooking at (2,3):'3', and its adjacent unexplored squares are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (2,2).\n\nI need to have three bombs in these four squares.\n\nSo, probably, three of them are bombs, and one is safe.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine which one is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 8:\n\n8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo, columns 0,1,2 are '3','3','2', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nLet's look at (8,0):'3'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\n(7,0): '1', safe\n\n(7,1): '.', unexplored\n\n(7,2): '1', safe\n\n(8,1): '3', safe\n\n(8,2): '2', safe\n\n(9,0): '.', unexplored\n\n(9,1): '.', unexplored\n\n(9,2): '1', safe\n\nSo, for (8,0):'3', it needs three bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (7,1): unexplored\n\n- (8,1): '3', safe\n\n- (8,2): '2', safe\n\n- (9,0): unexplored\n\n- (9,1): unexplored\n\n- (7,0): '1', safe\n\n- (7,2): '1', safe\n\n- (9,2): '1', safe\n\nSo, only (7,1), (9,0), and (9,1) are unexplored.\n\nTherefore, all three must be bombs.\n\nSo, I should place flags at (7,1), (9,0), and (9,1).\n\nBut wait, the game only has 9 flags remaining, and I've already placed one at (4,0) and plan to place one at (6,6), that's two flags placed, with 8 remaining.\n\nBut if I place three more flags, that would make five flags placed, with flags remaining:4.\n\nBut according to the game info, flags remaining:9, bombs:10.\n\nMaybe the game allows more flags than bombs, but ideally, we should have exactly 10 flags placed by the end.\n\nBut for now, assuming that I can place more flags, I'll proceed to flag (7,1), (9,0), and (9,1).\n\nAfter placing these flags, I should have flags at:\n\n- (4,0)\n\n- (6,6)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (9,1)\n\nTotal of five flags placed, with flags remaining:5 (assuming the game subtracts one for each flag placed).\n\nBut according to the game info, flags remaining:9, which might indicate that the game doesn't subtract flags automatically, or perhaps the flag at (4,0) wasn't counted.\n\nIn any case, I'll proceed with the assumption that placing a flag reduces the flags remaining by one.\n\nNow, looking back at row 2, column 3: '3'.\n\nIts adjacent unexplored squares are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (2,2).\n\nEarlier, I thought that three of these must be bombs.\n\nBut now, considering the flags I've placed elsewhere, perhaps the situation changes.\n\nBut actually, the flags I placed at (7,1), (9,0), and (9,1) are in a different area, so they don't affect the bomb count around (2,3).\n\nTherefore, still, for (2,3):'3', with four unexplored adjacent squares: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (2,2), and three of them must be bombs.\n\nSo, probably, I should avoid revealing any of these for now, as I don't know which one is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for other areas where I can make safer moves.\n\nLooking at row 6:\n\n6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nSo, columns 0,1,2,5,7 are '1's, and columns 6 and 9 are '.'.\n\nLooking at (6,6): '.', which I plan to flag as a bomb.\n\nLooking at (6,7): '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)\n\n(5,6): '1', safe\n\n(5,7): '.', unexplored\n\n(5,8): '1', safe\n\n(6,6): flagged as bomb\n\n(6,8): '.', unexplored\n\n(7,6): '1', safe\n\n(7,7): '1', safe\n\n(7,8): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, for (6,7):'1', it has one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (5,7): unexplored\n\n- (5,8): safe\n\n- (6,6): bomb\n\n- (6,8): unexplored\n\n- (7,7): safe\n\n- (7,8): unexplored\n\nSo, the '1' is already satisfied by the bomb at (6,6), so the other unexplored squares: (5,7), (6,8), and (7,8) should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (5,7).\n\nBut before doing that, let's see if there's a better move.\n\nLooking at (5,7): '.', which is unexplored, and according to the above reasoning, it should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (6,8): '.', which should also be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (7,8): '.', should be safe.\n\nSo, I have multiple options for safe reveals.\n\nBut perhaps I should start with (5,7).\n\nSo, I'll choose to reveal (5,7).\n\nBut wait, let's see if there are any other areas I should consider first.\n\nLooking back at row 1:\n\n1: _ 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nAt (1,1): '2', with adjacent squares:\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n(0,0): '_', safe\n\n(0,1): '1', safe\n\n(0,2): '1', safe\n\n(1,0): '_', safe\n\n(1,2): '.', unexplored\n\n(2,0): '_', safe\n\n(2,1): '2', safe\n\n(2,2): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, for (1,1):'2', with two bombs adjacent.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (0,1): '1', safe\n\n- (0,2): '1', safe\n\n- (1,0): '_', safe\n\n- (1,2): '.', unexplored\n\n- (2,1): '2', safe\n\n- (2,2): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, only (1,2) and (2,2) are unexplored.\n\nTherefore, both must be bombs to satisfy the '2' at (1,1).\n\nSo, I should place flags at (1,2) and (2,2).\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that (2,2) might be safe based on (3,1):'1'.\n\nBut now, according to (1,1):'2', both (1,2) and (2,2) must be bombs.\n\nThis contradicts my earlier assumption.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nFrom (1,1):'2', with adjacent squares:\n\n- (0,1): '1', safe\n\n- (0,2): '1', safe\n\n- (1,0): '_', safe\n\n- (1,2): '.', unexplored\n\n- (2,1): '2', safe\n\n- (2,2): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, to satisfy the '2', both (1,2) and (2,2) must be bombs.\n\nBut earlier, from (3,1):'1', with a bomb at (4,0), the '1' was already satisfied, so (2,2) should be safe.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps I miscounted the neighbors for (3,1):'1'.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\n(3,1):'1'. Adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\n(2,0): '_', safe\n\n(2,1): '2', safe\n\n(2,2): '.', unexplored\n\n(3,0): '_', safe\n\n(3,2): '1', safe\n\n(4,0): 'F', bomb\n\n(4,1): '_', safe\n\n(4,2): '_', safe\n\nSo, with the bomb at (4,0), the '1' is satisfied, meaning no other bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nTherefore, (2,2) should be safe.\n\nBut according to (1,1):'2', both (1,2) and (2,2) must be bombs.\n\nThis is a conflict.\n\nPerhaps I need to conclude that (1,1):'2' cannot have both (1,2) and (2,2) as bombs, because (3,1):'1' requires (2,2) to be safe.\n\nThis suggests that there might be an error in the board or in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the '2' at (1,1) is not correctly accounted for.\n\nWait, perhaps the '2' at (1,1) has more than two unexplored adjacent squares.\n\nLooking again, its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,1): '1', safe\n\n- (0,2): '1', safe\n\n- (1,0): '_', safe\n\n- (1,2): '.', unexplored\n\n- (2,1): '2', safe\n\n- (2,2): '.', unexplored\n\nOnly two unexplored squares, so both must be bombs to satisfy the '2'.\n\nBut this conflicts with (3,1):'1', which requires (2,2) to be safe.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the '2' at (1,1) doesn't have two bombs adjacent.\n\nMaybe there's an error in the board setup or in my assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag at (4,0) is incorrect.\n\nWait, but there's a 'F' at (4,0), and the '1' at (3,1) is satisfied by that flag.\n\nSo, assuming that the flag at (4,0) is correct, then (2,2) must be safe.\n\nBut then, for (1,1):'2', with (1,2) and (2,2) as adjacent unexplored squares, if (2,2) is safe, then (1,2) must be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, I should place a flag at (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, for (2,3):'3', with adjacent unexplored squares (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (2,2), and knowing that (1,2) is a bomb, there are still two more bombs to be placed among (1,3), (1,4), and (2,2).\n\nBut earlier, from (3,1):'1', (2,2) must be safe.\n\nWait, that can't be, because if (1,2) is a bomb (from (1,1):'2'), and (3,1):'1' is satisfied by (4,0), then (2,2) must be safe.\n\nBut then, for (2,3):'3', with three bombs adjacent, and (1,2) is a bomb, then two more bombs must be among (1,3), (1,4), and (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) must be safe based on (3,1):'1'.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to accept that there's a contradiction and consider that (1,2) cannot be a bomb, meaning that the '2' at (1,1) is miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag at (4,0) is incorrect.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as it satisfies the '1' at (3,1).\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should make a safer move elsewhere.\n\nLooking back at row 5, column 7: '.', which I earlier concluded is safe based on (5,5):'1' and (6,5):'1'.\n\nSo, perhaps I should reveal (5,7).\n\nBut before doing that, let's see if there are any other areas I should consider.\n\nLooking at row 9:\n\n9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nAt (9,2): '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3)\n\nBut since the board is 10x10, row 10 doesn't exist, so only (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3) are adjacent.\n\n(8,1): '3', safe\n\n(8,2): '2', safe\n\n(8,3): '.', unexplored\n\n(9,1): flagged as bomb\n\n(9,3): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, for (9,2):'1', with one bomb adjacent.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (8,1): '3', safe\n\n- (8,2): '2', safe\n\n- (8,3): unexplored\n\n- (9,1): bomb (flagged)\n\n- (9,3): unexplored\n\nSo, the '1' is already satisfied by the bomb at (9,1), meaning that the other unexplored squares, (8,3) and (9,3), should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (8,3) or (9,3).\n\nPerhaps I'll choose to reveal (8,3).\n\nBut before doing that, let's see if there are more flags I should place.\n\nLooking back at row 2, column 3: '3'.\n\nIts adjacent unexplored squares are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (2,2).\n\nFrom earlier, (1,2) should be a bomb, and (2,2) should be safe.\n\nTherefore, among (1,3) and (1,4), one must be a bomb.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine which one.\n\nSo, perhaps I should avoid that area for now.\n\nInstead, I'll proceed to reveal (8,3).\n\nBut wait, let's make sure that (8,3) is indeed safe.\n\nFrom (9,2):'1', with the bomb at (9,1), the adjacent unexplored squares (8,3) and (9,3) should be safe.\n\nTherefore, revealing (8,3) should be safe.\n\nSo, I'll choose to reveal (8,3).\n\nBut before making that move, let's see if there are any other safe reveals I can make.\n\nLooking back at row 6, column 7: '1'.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)\n\n(5,6): '1', safe\n\n(5,7): '.', unexplored\n\n(5,8): '1', safe\n\n(6,6): flagged as bomb\n\n(6,8): '.', unexplored\n\n(7,6): '1', safe\n\n(7,7): '1', safe\n\n(7,8): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, for (6,7):'1', with the bomb at (6,6), the other adjacent unexplored squares (5,7), (6,8), and (7,8) should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal any of these.\n\nPerhaps I'll choose to reveal (5,7).\n\nBut since I already have (8,3) as a safe reveal from earlier, maybe I'll choose that instead.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps revealing (5,7) would give me more information about other areas.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nIf I reveal (5,7), and it's safe, it might reveal more numbers that can help me deduce the positions of more bombs.\n\nSimilarly, revealing (8,3) might also give me more information.\n\nBetween the two, (5,7) is connected to more revealed numbers, so perhaps it's a better choice.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose to reveal (5,7).\n\nBut before doing that, let's see what's around (5,7).\n\nAdjacent to (5,7):\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)\n\n(4,6): '1', safe\n\n(4,7): '.', unexplored\n\n(4,8): '1', safe\n\n(5,6): '1', safe\n\n(5,8): '1', safe\n\n(6,6): flagged as bomb\n\n(6,7): '1', safe\n\n(6,8): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, revealing (5,7) might connect to more areas and give me more information.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with revealing (5,7).\n\nBut, to be thorough, perhaps I should consider placing more flags first.\n\nLooking back at row 1, column 1: '2'.\n\nIts adjacent unexplored squares are (1,2) and (2,2).\n\nFrom earlier, I concluded that (1,2) should be a bomb, based on (1,1):'2', and (2,2) should be safe based on (3,1):'1'.\n\nBut there's a conflict because (1,1):'2' requires both (1,2) and (2,2) to be bombs, while (3,1):'1' requires (2,2) to be safe.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the flag at (4,0) is incorrect, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to accept that there's a contradiction and consider that the board might have an error, which is unlikely.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize revealing squares that are definitely safe, based on the current information.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose to reveal (5,7).\n\nBut before making that move, let's see if there are any other flags I should place.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 0: '3'.\n\nIts adjacent unexplored squares are (7,1), (9,0), and (9,1), which I've already flagged as bombs.\n\nSimilarly, in row 6, column 7: '1', with the bomb at (6,6), and the other adjacent unexplored squares being safe.\n\nTherefore, I think it's safe to reveal (5,7).\n\nSo, my next move is to reveal (5,7).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this Minesweeper puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the board state and make logical deductions to determine safe moves or places to flag potential bombs.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 8, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see a 'F' at position (4,0), so that's where one flag is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. I'll start by looking at the revealed numbers and see if I can deduce where some bombs are.\n\nLet's look at row 0:\n\n0: _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1:\n\n1: _ 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2:\n\n2: _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n\nRow 3:\n\n3: _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 4:\n\n4: F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 5:\n\n5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\nRow 6:\n\n6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nRow 7:\n\n7: 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\nRow 8:\n\n8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 9:\n\n9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo, starting from the top-left, there are some revealed numbers and some unexplored spaces.\n\nLet me focus on the area around the flag at (4,0). Since it's a flag, there should be a bomb there. Now, looking at the '1's and '2's around it, I can try to see if there are any forced moves.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 1 and 2, both are '1's. The '.' at (0,3) is unexplored. Similarly, in row 1, column 1 is '2', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 2, where there are more numbers revealed.\n\nIn row 2:\n\nColumn 0: '_', which is revealed empty.\n\nColumn 1: '2'\n\nColumn 2: '.'\n\nColumn 3: '3'\n\nColumn 4: '1'\n\nColumn 5: '2'\n\nColumn 6: '1'\n\nColumn 7: '2'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nSo, at (2,1): '2', which means there are 2 bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nBut (2,0) is revealed empty, so no bomb there. (1,1) is '2', also revealed, so no bomb. (2,2) is '.', unexplored. (3,0) is '_', revealed empty. (3,1) is '1'. (3,2) is '1'. (1,0) is '_', revealed empty. (1,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, adjacent to (2,1), the possible bomb locations are (2,2) and (1,2), since the others are either revealed empty or have numbers.\n\nBut wait, (2,1) is '2', and it has two possible bomb locations: (2,2) and (1,2). So, both of these must have bombs.\n\nBut, hold on, there's a flag already at (4,0), which is below this area. Maybe I should consider that as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at row 3 and row 4 to see how the flag at (4,0) affects the numbers around it.\n\nIn row 3:\n\nColumn 0: '_', revealed empty.\n\nColumn 1: '1'\n\nColumn 2: '1'\n\nColumn 3: '1'\n\nColumn 4: '_'\n\nColumn 5: '_'\n\nColumn 6: '_'\n\nColumn 7: '_'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nIn row 4:\n\nColumn 0: 'F', flagged.\n\nColumn 1: '_'\n\nColumn 2: '_'\n\nColumn 3: '_'\n\nColumn 4: '_'\n\nColumn 5: '_'\n\nColumn 6: '_'\n\nColumn 7: '_'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nSo, the flag at (4,0) affects the '1's in (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), and (3,8), as well as possibly others.\n\nLet's look at (3,1): '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\n(3,0) is revealed empty, no bomb.\n\n(2,1) is '2', no bomb.\n\n(2,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(3,2) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(4,0) is flagged, bomb there.\n\n(4,1) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,2) is '_', revealed empty.\n\nSo, for (3,1): '1', and we know there's a bomb at (4,0), which is one of its neighbors. So, the other neighbors cannot have bombs.\n\nTherefore, (2,2) and (4,1), (4,2) are safe.\n\nWait, but (2,2) is '.', unexplored. Since (3,1) is '1' and we already have one bomb at (4,0), the other neighbors cannot have bombs. So, (2,2) is safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): '1'. Its neighbors are:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n(2,1) is '2', no bomb.\n\n(2,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(2,3) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(3,1) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(3,3) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(4,1) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,2) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,3) is '_', revealed empty.\n\nSo, for (3,2): '1', and we have one bomb at (4,0), which is not adjacent to (3,2). Wait, (4,0) is not adjacent to (3,2). So, the '1' at (3,2) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nBut none of its adjacent squares are flagged or have bombs, so one of (2,2), (2,3), or another adjacent square must have a bomb.\n\nWait, but (4,0) is not adjacent to (3,2), so the '1' at (3,2) is independent of the flag at (4,0).\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet me look at row 2, column 3: '3'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n(1,2): '.', unexplored.\n\n(1,3): '.', unexplored.\n\n(1,4): '.', unexplored.\n\n(2,2): '.', unexplored.\n\n(2,4): '1'\n\n(3,2): '1'\n\n(3,3): '1'\n\n(3,4): '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, '3' means there are 3 bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n(1,3): '.', unexplored.\n\n(1,4): '.', unexplored.\n\n(1,5): '.', unexplored.\n\n(2,3): '3'\n\n(2,5): '2'\n\n(3,3): '1'\n\n(3,4): '.', unexplored.\n\n(3,5): '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, (2,4): '1' means one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut (2,3): '3' is already adjacent to it.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler deduction.\n\nLet me look at row 6:\n\nRow 6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nSo, (6,0): '1', (6,1): '1', (6,2): '1', (6,5): '1', (6,7): '1', and (6,8): '.'.\n\nLooking at (6,0): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\n(5,0): '_', revealed empty.\n\n(5,1): '_', revealed empty.\n\n(5,2): '_', revealed empty.\n\n(6,1): '1'\n\n(6,2): '1'\n\n(7,0): '1'\n\n(7,1): '1'\n\n(7,2): '1'\n\nSo, for (6,0): '1', and all its adjacent squares are either revealed numbers or empty, which means there must be one bomb in the unrevealed adjacent squares. But all adjacent squares are revealed, so there are no bombs around it. Wait, but it's showing '1', which means there should be one bomb adjacent. But all adjacent squares are revealed and safe, which is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board. Let me check row 6 again:\n\nRow 5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\nRow 6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nRow 7: 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\nRow 8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nWait, in row 6, column 6: '.', which is unexplored.\n\nSo, for (6,0): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,0): '_', safe\n\n- (5,1): '_', safe\n\n- (5,2): '_', safe\n\n- (6,1): '1', safe\n\n- (6,2): '1', safe\n\n- (7,0): '1', safe\n\n- (7,1): '1', safe\n\n- (7,2): '1', safe\n\nWait, but (6,0) shows '1', meaning one adjacent bomb, but all its adjacent squares are revealed and safe, which suggests that the bomb must be in a square that is not adjacent to it. That doesn't make sense because the bomb should be in one of the adjacent squares.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that (6,0) is '1', and all its adjacent squares are revealed safe, which means that the bomb must be in one of the squares that is adjacent to (6,0)'s neighbors but not to (6,0) itself. This is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet me look at row 8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo, (8,0): '3', (8,1): '3', (8,2): '2', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nLooking at (8,0): '3', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (7,0): '1'\n\n- (7,1): '1'\n\n- (7,2): '1'\n\n- (8,1): '3'\n\n- (8,3): '.'\n\n- (9,0): '.'\n\n- (9,1): '.'\n\n- (9,2): '1'\n\nSo, for (8,0): '3', and we have:\n\n- (7,0): '1', safe\n\n- (7,1): '1', safe\n\n- (7,2): '1', safe\n\n- (8,1): '3', safe\n\n- (8,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (9,0): '.', unexplored\n\n- (9,1): '.', unexplored\n\n- (9,2): '1', safe\n\nSo, out of these, only (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1) are unexplored. Since (8,0) has '3', meaning three bombs adjacent to it, and all revealed squares are safe, the three bombs must be in (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1).\n\nTherefore, I can flag (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1) as bombs.\n\nBut wait, I only have 9 flags remaining, and there are 10 bombs in total. One bomb has already been flagged at (4,0), so there are 9 bombs left to flag. If I flag these three squares, I'll use up 3 flags, leaving me with 6 flags remaining.\n\nBut let's verify if these three squares indeed contain bombs.\n\nLooking at (9,2): '1', which is adjacent to (9,1) and (9,0), as well as (8,2): '2', which is adjacent to (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nWait, (8,2): '2', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (7,1): '1', safe\n\n- (7,2): '1', safe\n\n- (7,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (8,1): '3', safe\n\n- (8,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (9,1): '.', potential bomb\n\n- (9,2): '1', safe\n\n- (9,3): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (8,2): '2', has two bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3).\n\nAmong these, (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), and (9,2) are safe. So, the bombs must be in (7,3), (8,3), and (9,1).\n\nBut earlier, I thought that (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1) are bombs based on (8,0): '3'.\n\nBut now, (8,2): '2' suggests that (7,3), (8,3), and (9,1) are bombs.\n\nThere's an inconsistency here because (9,1) appears in both sets, but (8,0): '3' suggests (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1), while (8,2): '2' suggests (7,3), (8,3), and (9,1).\n\nWait, but (8,2): '2' only needs two bombs adjacent to it. If (8,3) and (9,1) are bombs, that would satisfy it, assuming (7,3) is not a bomb.\n\nBut (8,0): '3' requires three bombs adjacent to it, which are (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1).\n\nSo, perhaps (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1) are bombs, and (7,3) is safe.\n\nBut then (8,2): '2' would have bombs at (8,3) and (9,1), which is two bombs, as required.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I can flag (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1) as bombs.\n\nBut before doing that, let me check if placing these flags would conflict with any other numbers.\n\nLooking at (9,2): '1', which is adjacent to (9,1) and (9,0), both of which are flagged as bombs. But (9,2): '1' should only have one adjacent bomb, so if both (9,0) and (9,1) are bombs, that would make two bombs adjacent to (9,2), which contradicts the '1'.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, if I flag (9,0), (9,1), and (8,3) as bombs, then (9,2): '1' would have two adjacent bombs, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, my earlier assumption must be wrong.\n\nPerhaps not all three of (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1) are bombs. Maybe only two of them are bombs, and one is safe.\n\nBut (8,0): '3' requires three bombs adjacent to it.\n\nWait, but if (9,2): '1' can only have one bomb adjacent, and it's adjacent to (9,1) and (9,0), then only one of them can be a bomb.\n\nBut (8,0): '3' requires three bombs adjacent to it: (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1). But if only one of (9,0) and (9,1) can be a bomb due to (9,2): '1', then there's a conflict.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps (8,3) must be a bomb, and only one of (9,0) or (9,1) is a bomb.\n\nBut (8,0): '3' needs three bombs, which would require (8,3), and two more bombs among (9,0), (9,1), and possibly others.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that (8,0) is connected to more potential bomb spaces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at row 9:\n\n(9,0): '.', unexplored\n\n(9,1): '.', unexplored\n\n(9,2): '1'\n\n(9,3): '.', unexplored\n\n...\n\nSo, (9,2): '1', adjacent to (9,1) and (9,0). So, only one of them can be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (8,0): '3', adjacent to (8,1), (8,3), (9,0), (9,1), etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the possible combinations.\n\nSuppose (9,0) is a bomb. Then, (9,1) cannot be a bomb because (9,2): '1' can only have one adjacent bomb.\n\nSimilarly, if (9,1) is a bomb, then (9,0) cannot be a bomb.\n\nBut (8,0): '3' requires three bombs adjacent to it, which are (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1). But if only one of (9,0) and (9,1) can be a bomb, then (8,3) must be a bomb, and one of (9,0) or (9,1) must be a bomb, totaling two bombs adjacent to (8,0), which is less than the required three.\n\nThis suggests that there must be another bomb adjacent to (8,0). Looking at (8,3): '.', (9,0): '.', (9,1): '.', and also (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), which are all revealed safe.\n\nWait, but (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1) are the only unexplored adjacent squares to (8,0). So, if only two of them can be bombs, then (8,0): '3' cannot be satisfied.\n\nThis indicates a potential error in my earlier assumptions.\n\nPerhaps there is a bomb in another square that I haven't considered.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the bigger picture.\n\nLet me consider the area around the flag at (4,0).\n\nFrom earlier, I saw that (3,1): '1' and (4,0): 'F', so the bomb at (4,0) satisfies the '1' at (3,1), meaning the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): '1' must have one bomb in its adjacent squares, but (4,0) is not adjacent to it, so there must be another bomb somewhere in its adjacent squares.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to look for a safer move elsewhere on the board.\n\nLet me look at row 5:\n\nRow 5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo, (5,5): '1', (5,6): '1', (5,7): '1', (5,8): '1', (5,9): '1'\n\nLooking at (5,5): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nBut (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are all either revealed or unexplored.\n\nWait, (4,4): '_', safe\n\n(4,5): '_', safe\n\n(4,6): '_', safe\n\n(5,4): '_', safe\n\n(5,6): '1', safe\n\n(6,4): '_', safe\n\n(6,5): '1', safe\n\n(6,6): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (5,5): '1' has one bomb in its adjacent squares. The only unexplored adjacent square is (6,6): '.', so that must be the bomb.\n\nTherefore, I can flag (6,6) as a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (5,6): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\n(4,5): '_', safe\n\n(4,6): '_', safe\n\n(4,7): '_', safe\n\n(5,5): '1', safe\n\n(5,7): '1', safe\n\n(6,5): '1', safe\n\n(6,6): '.', flagged as bomb\n\n(6,7): '1', safe\n\nSo, (5,6): '1' has one bomb adjacent, which is at (6,6), so the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nSimilarly, (5,7): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)\n\n(4,6): '_', safe\n\n(4,7): '_', safe\n\n(4,8): '_', safe\n\n(5,6): '1', safe\n\n(5,8): '1', safe\n\n(6,6): '.', flagged as bomb\n\n(6,7): '1', safe\n\n(6,8): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (5,7): '1' has one bomb adjacent, which is at (6,6), so the other adjacent squares are safe, including (6,8): '.'.\n\nSimilarly, (5,8): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)\n\n(4,7): '_', safe\n\n(4,8): '_', safe\n\n(4,9): '_', safe\n\n(5,7): '1', safe\n\n(5,9): '1', safe\n\n(6,7): '1', safe\n\n(6,8): '.', safe (since (5,7): '1' has its bomb accounted for)\n\n(6,9): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (5,8): '1' has one bomb adjacent. The only unexplored adjacent square is (6,9): '.', which must be the bomb.\n\nTherefore, I can flag (6,9) as a bomb.\n\nNow, I have flagged (6,6) and (6,9) as bombs, in addition to the flag at (4,0). So, total flags used: 3, and flags remaining: 9 - 2 = 7.\n\nWait, but initially, flags remaining were 9, and I just placed two more flags, so flags remaining should be 7.\n\nNow, looking back at row 6:\n\nRow 6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nSo, (6,6): '.', flagged as bomb\n\n(6,9): '.', flagged as bomb\n\nNow, looking at (6,5): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n(5,4): '_', safe\n\n(5,5): '1', safe\n\n(5,6): '1', safe\n\n(6,4): '_', safe\n\n(6,6): '.', flagged as bomb\n\n(7,4): '_', safe\n\n(7,5): '1', safe\n\n(7,6): '1', safe\n\nSo, (6,5): '1' has one bomb adjacent, which is at (6,6), so the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nSimilarly, (6,7): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)\n\n(5,6): '1', safe\n\n(5,7): '1', safe\n\n(5,8): '1', safe\n\n(6,6): '.', flagged as bomb\n\n(6,8): '.', safe\n\n(7,6): '1', safe\n\n(7,7): '1', safe\n\n(7,8): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (6,7): '1' has one bomb adjacent, which is at (6,6), so the other adjacent squares are safe, including (6,8): '.'.\n\nNow, (6,8): '.', is safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, (6,9): '.', is flagged as bomb.\n\nLooking at row 7:\n\nRow 7: 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\nSo, (7,1): '.', unexplored\n\n(7,2): '1'\n\n(7,5): '1'\n\n(7,6): '1'\n\n(7,7): '1'\n\n(7,9): '.', unexplored\n\nLooking at (7,2): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)\n\n(6,1): '1', safe\n\n(6,2): '1', safe\n\n(6,3): '_', safe\n\n(7,1): '.', unexplored\n\n(7,3): '.', unexplored\n\n(8,1): '3', safe\n\n(8,2): '2', safe\n\n(8,3): '.', potential bomb\n\nSo, (7,2): '1' has one bomb adjacent.

Maybe I should try to reveal (6,8): '.', since it's safe.\n\nBut before doing that, let me check if there are any other obvious moves.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\nRow 2: _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n\nSo, (2,2): '.', unexplored\n\n(2,3): '3'\n\n(2,4): '1'\n\n(2,5): '2'\n\n(2,6): '1'\n\n(2,7): '2'\n\n(2,8): '1'\n\n(2,9): '.'\n\nLooking at (2,3): '3', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n(1,2): '.', unexplored\n\n(1,3): '.', unexplored\n\n(1,4): '.', unexplored\n\n(2,2): '.', unexplored\n\n(2,4): '1'\n\n(3,2): '1'\n\n(3,3): '1'\n\n(3,4): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (2,3): '3' needs three bombs adjacent to it. The possible bomb locations are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (3,4).\n\nBut this is too many possibilities. Maybe I can look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at (2,5): '2', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\n(1,4): '.', unexplored\n\n(1,5): '.', unexplored\n\n(1,6): '.', unexplored\n\n(2,4): '1'\n\n(2,6): '1'\n\n(3,4): '.', unexplored\n\n(3,5): '.', unexplored\n\n(3,6): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (2,5): '2' needs two bombs adjacent to it. Possible locations are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\n\nThis is too vague to make a decision.\n\nPerhaps I should look back to row 6 and reveal (6,8): '.' since it's safe.\n\nBut before doing that, let me check if there are any other flags I can place.\n\nLooking at row 8:\n\nRow 8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo, (8,0): '3'\n\n(8,1): '3'\n\n(8,2): '2'\n\n(8,3): '.', potential bomb\n\n(8,4): '.', unexplored\n\n(8,5): '.', unexplored\n\n(8,6): '.', unexplored\n\n(8,7): '.', unexplored\n\n(8,8): '.', unexplored\n\n(8,9): '.', unexplored\n\nEarlier, I thought that (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1) are bombs, but that led to a contradiction with (9,2): '1'.\n\nPerhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nLooking at (8,1): '3', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\n(7,0): '1', safe\n\n(7,1): '1', safe\n\n(7,2): '1', safe\n\n(8,0): '3', safe\n\n(8,2): '2', safe\n\n(9,0): '.', potential bomb\n\n(9,1): '.', potential bomb\n\n(9,2): '1', safe\n\nSo, (8,1): '3' needs three bombs adjacent to it. The only unexplored adjacent squares are (9,0) and (9,1). So, both must be bombs.\n\nBut, as before, (9,2): '1' can only have one adjacent bomb, but (9,0) and (9,1) are both adjacent to it, which would make two bombs adjacent to (9,2), which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, there must be a different configuration.\n\nPerhaps (8,1): '3' has bombs at (9,0), (9,1), and another square.\n\nBut all its adjacent squares are either safe or unexplored, and the unexplored ones are (9,0) and (9,1). So, both must be bombs to satisfy the '3'.\n\nBut that conflicts with (9,2): '1'.\n\nThis suggests that there might be a mistake in the board or in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a bomb in a square that I haven't considered.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that (8,3): '.' is also adjacent to (8,2): '2'.\n\nEarlier, I thought that (8,3) is a bomb, but maybe it's not.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose that (9,0) is a bomb and (9,1) is not a bomb.\n\nThen, (8,1): '3' would have bombs at (9,0) and possibly others, but it needs three bombs adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (9,2): '1' would have one bomb adjacent, which is at (9,0).\n\nThen, (8,1): '3' would still need two more bombs adjacent to it.\n\nThese would have to be in (1,2), but that's not adjacent.\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total number of flags remaining and the number of possible bomb locations.\n\nFlags remaining: 9\n\nBombs in total: 10\n\nSo, one flag has already been placed.\n\nLooking at the board, I've placed flags at (4,0), (6,6), and (6,9), totaling three flags.\n\nBut according to the game info, flags remaining are 9, which would mean that only one flag has been placed.\n\nPerhaps I miscounted.\n\nLooking back, the game info says flags remaining: 9, bombs: 10.\n\nSo, flags placed: 10 - 9 = 1 flag placed, which is at (4,0).\n\nTherefore, I cannot place any more flags without exceeding the total number of bombs.\n\nSo, I need to be careful about placing flags.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should avoid placing more flags and instead reveal some safe squares.\n\nLooking back at row 6, (6,8): '.' is safe to reveal, as per earlier reasoning.\n\nSo, I'll go ahead and reveal (6,8): '.'.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed safely in this Minesweeper game, we need to carefully analyze the board and make logical deductions to avoid revealing bombs. Given the current state of the board, the best next move is to reveal a specific safe square.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze Revealed Numbers:** Look at the numbers on the board to determine the possible locations of bombs based on their adjacent squares.\n2. **Check for Safe Squares:** Identify squares that are guaranteed to be safe based on the numbers and existing flags.\n3. **Avoid Placing Unnecessary Flags:** Ensure that placing a flag adheres to the rules and does not lead to contradictions with the revealed numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a Minesweeper game, the \"code\" involves specifying the coordinates of the square to reveal or flag. In this case, the next safe move is to reveal the square at position (6,8).\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: Based on the analysis, square (6,8) is determined to be safe.\nMOVE: 6,8,false\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Step-by-Step Analysis:** The board was analyzed by examining the numbers and their adjacent squares to deduce the positions of bombs and safe squares.\n- **Safe Square Identification:** Through logical deduction, square (6,8) was determined to be safe to reveal without the risk of hitting a bomb.\n- **Final Move:** The move to reveal square (6,8) is chosen to progress safely in the game.\n\nThis approach ensures that we make a safe move, advancing in the game without risking hitting a bomb.", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ 2 . . . . . . . .\n2 _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n4 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n7 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see a 'F' at position (4,0), so that's where one flag is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. I'll start by looking at the revealed numbers and see if I can deduce where some bombs are.\n\nLet's look at row 0:\n\n0: _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1:\n\n1: _ 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2:\n\n2: _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n\nRow 3:\n\n3: _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 4:\n\n4: F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 5:\n\n5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\nRow 6:\n\n6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nRow 7:\n\n7: 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\nRow 8:\n\n8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 9:\n\n9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo, starting from the top-left, there are some revealed numbers and some unexplored spaces.\n\nLet me focus on the area around the flag at (4,0). Since it's a flag, there should be a bomb there. Now, looking at the '1's and '2's around it, I can try to see if there are any forced moves.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 1 and 2, both are '1's. The '.' at (0,3) is unexplored. Similarly, in row 1, column 1 is '2', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 2, where there are more numbers revealed.\n\nIn row 2:\n\nColumn 0: '_', which is revealed empty.\n\nColumn 1: '2'\n\nColumn 2: '.'\n\nColumn 3: '3'\n\nColumn 4: '1'\n\nColumn 5: '2'\n\nColumn 6: '1'\n\nColumn 7: '2'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nSo, at (2,1): '2', which means there are 2 bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nBut (2,0) is revealed empty, so no bomb there. (1,1) is '2', also revealed, so no bomb. (2,2) is '.', unexplored. (3,0) is '_', revealed empty. (3,1) is '1'. (3,2) is '1'. (1,0) is '_', revealed empty. (1,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, adjacent to (2,1), the possible bomb locations are (2,2) and (1,2), since the others are either revealed empty or have numbers.\n\nBut wait, (2,1) is '2', and it has two possible bomb locations: (2,2) and (1,2). So, both of these must have bombs.\n\nBut, hold on, there's a flag already at (4,0), which is below this area. Maybe I should consider that as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at row 3 and row 4 to see how the flag at (4,0) affects the numbers around it.\n\nIn row 3:\n\nColumn 0: '_', revealed empty.\n\nColumn 1: '1'\n\nColumn 2: '1'\n\nColumn 3: '1'\n\nColumn 4: '_'\n\nColumn 5: '_'\n\nColumn 6: '_'\n\nColumn 7: '_'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nIn row 4:\n\nColumn 0: 'F', flagged.\n\nColumn 1: '_'\n\nColumn 2: '_'\n\nColumn 3: '_'\n\nColumn 4: '_'\n\nColumn 5: '_'\n\nColumn 6: '_'\n\nColumn 7: '_'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nSo, the flag at (4,0) affects the '1's in (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), and (3,8), as well as possibly others.\n\nLet's look at (3,1): '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\n(3,0) is revealed empty, no bomb.\n\n(2,1) is '2', no bomb.\n\n(2,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(3,2) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(4,0) is flagged, bomb there.\n\n(4,1) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,2) is '_', revealed empty.\n\nSo, for (3,1): '1', and we know there's a bomb at (4,0), which is one of its neighbors. So, the other neighbors cannot have bombs.\n\nTherefore, (2,2) and (4,1), (4,2) are safe.\n\nWait, but (2,2) is '.', unexplored. Since (3,1) is '1' and we already have one bomb at (4,0), the other neighbors cannot have bombs. So, (2,2) is safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): '1'. Its neighbors are:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n(2,1) is '2', no bomb.\n\n(2,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(2,3) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(3,1) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(3,3) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(4,1) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,2) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,3) is '_', revealed empty.\n\nSo, for (3,2): '1', and we have one bomb at (4,0), which is not adjacent to (3,2). Wait, (4,0) is not adjacent to (3,2). So, the '1' at (3,2) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nBut none of its adjacent squares are flagged or have bombs, so one of (2,2), (2,3), or another adjacent square must have a bomb.\n\nWait, but (4,0) is not adjacent to (3,2), so the '1' at (3,2) is independent of the flag at (4,0).\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet me look at row 2, column 3: '3'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n(1,2): '.', unexplored.\n\n(1,3): '.', unexplored.\n\n(1,4): '.', unexplored.\n\n(2,2): '.', unexplored.\n\n(2,4): '1'\n\n(3,2): '1'\n\n(3,3): '1'\n\n(3,4): '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, '3' means there are 3 bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n(1,3): '.', unexplored.\n\n(1,4): '.', unexplored.\n\n(1,5): '.', unexplored.\n\n(2,3): '3'\n\n(2,5): '2'\n\n(3,3): '1'\n\n(3,4): '.', unexplored.\n\n(3,5): '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, (2,4): '1' means one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut (2,3): '3' is already adjacent to it.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler deduction.\n\nLet me look at row 6:\n\nRow 6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nSo, (6,0): '1', (6,1): '1', (6,2): '1', (6,5): '1', (6,7): '1', and (6,8): '.'.\n\nLooking at (6,0): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\n(5,0): '_', revealed empty.\n\n(5,1): '_', revealed empty.\n\n(5,2): '_', revealed empty.\n\n(6,1): '1'\n\n(6,2): '1'\n\n(7,0): '1'\n\n(7,1): '1'\n\n(7,2): '1'\n\nSo, for (6,0): '1', and all its adjacent squares are either revealed numbers or empty, which means there must be one bomb in the unrevealed adjacent squares. But all adjacent squares are revealed, so there are no bombs around it. Wait, but it's showing '1', which means there should be one bomb adjacent. But all adjacent squares are revealed and safe, which is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board. Let me check row 6 again:\n\nRow 5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\nRow 6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nRow 7: 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\nRow 8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nWait, in row 6, column 6: '.', which is unexplored.\n\nSo, for (6,0): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,0): '_', safe\n\n- (5,1): '_', safe\n\n- (5,2): '_', safe\n\n- (6,1): '1', safe\n\n- (6,2): '1', safe\n\n- (7,0): '1', safe\n\n- (7,1): '1', safe\n\n- (7,2): '1', safe\n\nWait, but (6,0) shows '1', meaning one adjacent bomb, but all its adjacent squares are revealed and safe, which suggests that the bomb must be in a square that is not adjacent to it. That doesn't make sense because the bomb should be in one of the adjacent squares.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that (6,0) is '1', and all its adjacent squares are revealed safe, which means that the bomb must be in one of the squares that is adjacent to (6,0)'s neighbors but not to (6,0) itself. This is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet me look at row 8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo, (8,0): '3', (8,1): '3', (8,2): '2', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nLooking at (8,0): '3', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (7,0): '1'\n\n- (7,1): '1'\n\n- (7,2): '1'\n\n- (8,1): '3'\n\n- (8,3): '.'\n\n- (9,0): '.'\n\n- (9,1): '.'\n\n- (9,2): '1'\n\nSo, for (8,0): '3', and we have:\n\n- (7,0): '1', safe\n\n- (7,1): '1', safe\n\n- (7,2): '1', safe\n\n- (8,1): '3', safe\n\n- (8,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (9,0): '.', unexplored\n\n- (9,1): '.', unexplored\n\n- (9,2): '1', safe\n\nSo, out of these, only (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1) are unexplored. Since (8,0) has '3', meaning three bombs adjacent to it, and all revealed squares are safe, the three bombs must be in (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1).\n\nTherefore, I can flag (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1) as bombs.\n\nBut wait, I only have 9 flags remaining, and there are 10 bombs in total. One bomb has already been flagged at (4,0), so there are 9 bombs left to flag. If I flag these three squares, I'll use up 3 flags, leaving me with 6 flags remaining.\n\nBut let's verify if these three squares indeed contain bombs.\n\nLooking at (9,2): '1', which is adjacent to (9,1) and (9,0), as well as (8,2): '2', which is adjacent to (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nWait, (8,2): '2', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (7,1): '1', safe\n\n- (7,2): '1', safe\n\n- (7,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (8,1): '3', safe\n\n- (8,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (9,1): '.', potential bomb\n\n- (9,2): '1', safe\n\n- (9,3): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (8,2): '2', has two bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3).\n\nAmong these, (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), and (9,2) are safe. So, the bombs must be in (7,3), (8,3), and (9,1).\n\nBut earlier, I thought that (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1) are bombs based on (8,0): '3'.\n\nBut now, (8,2): '2' suggests that (7,3), (8,3), and (9,1) are bombs.\n\nThere's an inconsistency here because (9,1) appears in both sets, but (8,0): '3' includes (9,0), while (8,2): '2' includes (7,3).\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that (8,0): '3' has its three bombs in (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1).\n\nSimilarly, (8,1): '3' has its three bombs in:\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (7,1): '1', safe\n\n- (7,2): '1', safe\n\n- (7,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (8,0): '3', safe\n\n- (8,2): '2', safe\n\n- (8,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (9,1): '.', potential bomb\n\n- (9,2): '1', safe\n\nSo, for (8,1): '3', the bombs must be in (7,3), (8,3), and (9,1).\n\nComparing this with (8,0): '3', which suggests bombs in (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1).\n\nSo, both agree that (8,3) and (9,1) are bombs, and differ on the third bomb being either (7,3) or (9,0).\n\nBut I only have enough flags left to flag these squares.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should flag (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1), and see if that makes sense with the other numbers.\n\nLooking at (9,2): '1', which is adjacent to (9,1), (9,0), and (8,2): '2', which is safe.\n\nIf (9,1) is a bomb, then (9,2): '1' already has one bomb adjacent, so the other adjacent squares cannot have bombs.\n\nBut (9,2) is adjacent to (8,2): '2' (safe), (9,1): bomb, and (9,3): '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, since (9,2): '1' has one bomb adjacent ((9,1)), the other adjacent square, (9,3), cannot have a bomb.\n\nTherefore, (9,3) is safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, (8,2): '2', with bombs in (7,3), (8,3), and (9,1).\n\nBut (8,2): '2' has two bombs adjacent, which would be (8,3) and (9,1), assuming (7,3) is not a bomb.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should flag (8,3), (9,0), and (9,1), and proceed from there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (7,2): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (6,1): '1', safe\n\n- (6,2): '1', safe\n\n- (6,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (7,1): '1', safe\n\n- (7,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (8,1): '3', safe\n\n- (8,2): '2', safe\n\n- (8,3): '.', potential bomb\n\nSo, (7,2): '1' has one bomb adjacent. The potential bomb adjacents are (6,3) and (7,3) and (8,3).\n\nBut (8,3) is already marked as a potential bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (7,3): '.', which is unexplored, and could be a bomb according to earlier deductions.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the area around the initial flag at (4,0).\n\nLooking at row 4:\n\nColumn 0: 'F', flagged.\n\nColumn 1: '_'\n\nColumn 2: '_'\n\nColumn 3: '_'\n\nColumn 4: '_'\n\nColumn 5: '_'\n\nColumn 6: '_'\n\nColumn 7: '_'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nSo, (4,8): '1', which means one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (3,7): '2', safe\n\n- (3,8): '1', safe\n\n- (3,9): '.', unexplored\n\n- (4,7): '_', safe\n\n- (4,9): '.', unexplored\n\n- (5,7): '1', safe\n\n- (5,8): '1', safe\n\n- (5,9): '1', safe\n\nSo, for (4,8): '1', the only possible bomb is in (3,9) or (4,9).\n\nBut (3,9): '.', unexplored, and (4,9): '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, one of these two must be a bomb.\n\nBut I already have a flag at (4,0), and I have 9 flags left to place, with 10 bombs in total.\n\nWait, no, I see that one flag has already been placed at (4,0), so there are 9 flags left, and 9 bombs remaining to flag.\n\nSo, I need to flag exactly 9 more squares.\n\nLooking back at (4,8): '1', with possible bombs in (3,9) or (4,9).\n\nSo, one of these two must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (3,8): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,7): '2', safe\n\n- (2,8): '1', safe\n\n- (2,9): '.', unexplored\n\n- (3,7): '2', safe\n\n- (3,9): '.', unexplored\n\n- (4,7): '_', safe\n\n- (4,8): '1', safe\n\n- (4,9): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (3,8): '1' has one bomb adjacent.\n\nThe possible bomb locations are (2,9), (3,9), and (4,9).\n\nBut from (4,8): '1', we know that either (3,9) or (4,9) has a bomb.\n\nSo, combining these, it's getting a bit tricky.\n\nMaybe I should look at another part of the board.\n\nLet me look at row 5:\n\nRow 5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo, (5,5): '1', (5,6): '1', (5,7): '1', (5,8): '1', (5,9): '1'\n\nLooking at (5,5): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,4): '_', safe\n\n- (4,5): '_', safe\n\n- (4,6): '_', safe\n\n- (5,4): '_', safe\n\n- (5,6): '1', safe\n\n- (6,4): '1', safe\n\n- (6,5): '1', safe\n\n- (6,6): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (5,5): '1' has one bomb adjacent.\n\nLooking at its adjacent squares:\n\nAll revealed as safe except (6,6): '.', which is unexplored.\n\nSo, the bomb must be in (6,6): '.'.\n\nTherefore, I can flag (6,6) as a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,5): '_', safe\n\n- (4,6): '_', safe\n\n- (4,7): '_', safe\n\n- (5,5): '1', safe\n\n- (5,7): '1', safe\n\n- (6,5): '1', safe\n\n- (6,6): '.', potential bomb\n\n- (6,7): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (5,6): '1' has one bomb adjacent.\n\nIf (6,6) is already a bomb, then (6,7) cannot have a bomb.\n\nTherefore, (6,7) is safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, (5,7): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,6): '_', safe\n\n- (4,7): '_', safe\n\n- (4,8): '1', safe\n\n- (5,6): '1', safe\n\n- (5,8): '1', safe\n\n- (6,6): '.', bomb\n\n- (6,7): '.', safe\n\n- (6,8): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (5,7): '1' has one bomb adjacent, which is (6,6), so (6,8) cannot have a bomb and is safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, (5,8): '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,7): '_', safe\n\n- (4,8): '1', safe\n\n- (4,9): '.', unexplored\n\n- (5,7): '1', safe\n\n- (5,9): '1', safe\n\n- (6,7): '.', safe\n\n- (6,8): '.', safe\n\n- (6,9): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (5,8): '1' has one bomb adjacent.\n\nPossible bomb locations are (4,9) and (6,9).\n\nBut earlier, from (4,8): '1', we had that either (3,9) or (4,9) has a bomb.\n\nSo, now, for (5,8): '1', the bomb must be in (4,9) or (6,9).\n\nBut (4,9) is also a possible bomb location for (4,8): '1'.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nBut, to summarize:\n\n- (6,6) is a bomb.\n\n- (6,7) and (6,8) are safe.\n\n- (4,9) and (6,9) could be bombs, but only one of them is, based on (5,8): '1'.\n\nWait, no, (5,8): '1' has one bomb adjacent, which could be either (4,9) or (6,9).\n\nBut from (4,8): '1', we have that one of (3,9) or (4,9) is a bomb.\n\nBut (3,9) is also adjacent to (3,8): '1', which has one bomb adjacent.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should flag (6,6) and see about the others.\n\nBut I already deduced that (6,6) is a bomb based on (5,5): '1'.\n\nSo, I can place a flag at (6,6).\n\nNow, with that flag placed, I have 8 flags left to place.\n\nLooking back at (5,8): '1', with adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,7): '_', safe\n\n- (4,8): '1', safe\n\n- (4,9): '.', potential bomb\n\n- (5,7): '1', safe\n\n- (5,9): '1', safe\n\n- (6,7): '.', safe\n\n- (6,8): '.', safe\n\n- (6,9): '.', potential bomb\n\nSince (5,8): '1' has one bomb adjacent, and (6,6) is already flagged, which is not adjacent to (5,8), the bomb must be in either (4,9) or (6,9).\n\nSimilarly, (4,8): '1' has adjacent squares:\n\n- (3,7): '2', safe\n\n- (3,8): '1', safe\n\n- (3,9): '.', potential bomb\n\n- (4,7): '_', safe\n\n- (4,9): '.', potential bomb\n\n- (5,7): '1', safe\n\n- (5,8): '1', safe\n\n- (5,9): '1', safe\n\nSo, for (4,8): '1', the bomb is in either (3,9) or (4,9).\n\nBut (3,8): '1' has adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,7): '2', safe\n\n- (2,8): '1', safe\n\n- (2,9): '.', potential bomb\n\n- (3,7): '2', safe\n\n- (3,9): '.', potential bomb\n\n- (4,7): '_', safe\n\n- (4,8): '1', safe\n\n- (4,9): '.', potential bomb\n\nSo, (3,8): '1' has one bomb adjacent, which could be in (2,9), (3,9), or (4,9).\n\nBut from (4,8): '1', the bomb is in either (3,9) or (4,9).\n\nFrom (5,8): '1', the bomb is in either (4,9) or (6,9).\n\nSo, it seems that (4,9) is a common square.\n\nPerhaps I can consider that (4,9) is a bomb.\n\nIf I flag (4,9), then:\n\n- (4,8): '1' is satisfied.\n\n- (5,8): '1' would still need another bomb in (6,9).\n\nBut (3,8): '1' would have bombs in (3,9) and (4,9), which would conflict with its '1'.\n\nWait, no, if (4,9) is a bomb, then (3,8): '1' would have bombs in (3,9) and (4,9), but it's only supposed to have one bomb adjacent.\n\nTherefore, (3,9) cannot be a bomb if (4,9) is a bomb.\n\nBut (5,8): '1' would require a bomb in (6,9) if (4,9) is a bomb.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the area around the '3' in row 2, column 3.\n\n(2,3): '3', adjacent squares:\n\n- (1,2): '.', unexplored\n\n- (1,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (1,4): '.', unexplored\n\n- (2,2): '.', unexplored\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, '3' means three bombs adjacent.\n\nLooking at (2,4): '1', adjacent squares:\n\n- (1,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (1,4): '.', unexplored\n\n- (1,5): '.', unexplored\n\n- (2,3): '3'\n\n- (2,5): '2'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '.', unexplored\n\n- (3,5): '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (2,4): '1' has one bomb adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): '1', adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,1): '2', safe\n\n- (2,2): '.', unexplored\n\n- (2,3): '3'\n\n- (3,1): '1', safe\n\n- (3,3): '1', safe\n\n- (4,1): '_', safe\n\n- (4,2): '_', safe\n\n- (4,3): '_', safe\n\nSo, (3,2): '1' has one bomb adjacent, which must be in (2,2) or (2,3): '3'.\n\nBut (2,3): '3' is already adjacent to multiple numbers.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should try to make a move based on the safer deductions I've made.\n\nI know that (6,7) and (6,8) are safe to reveal based on (5,5): '1' and (5,6): '1'.\n\nSo, perhaps I should reveal (6,7).\n\nBut to be cautious, let's check again.\n\nFrom (5,6): '1', with adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,5): safe\n\n- (4,6): safe\n\n- (4,7): safe\n\n- (5,5): safe\n\n- (5,7): safe\n\n- (6,5): safe\n\n- (6,6): bomb (flagged)\n\n- (6,7): safe\n\nSimilarly, (5,7): '1', with adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,6): safe\n\n- (4,7): safe\n\n- (4,8): safe\n\n- (5,6): safe\n\n- (5,8): safe\n\n- (6,6): bomb\n\n- (6,7): safe\n\n- (6,8): safe\n\nSo, both indicate that (6,7) is safe.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal (6,7).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed in the Minesweeper game, the next move should be to reveal the tile at position (6,7). This decision is based on the analysis of the adjacent numbers and the flags already placed, which indicate that this tile is safe to reveal without the risk of hitting a bomb.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nAfter carefully examining the board, particularly focusing on the numbers and flags, it was determined that the tile at (6,7) is safe. This conclusion is drawn from the following observations:\n\n1. The tile at (5,6) shows a '1', indicating one adjacent bomb. Given that (6,6) is already flagged as a bomb, no other adjacent tiles to (5,6) should contain bombs. Therefore, (6,7) is safe.\n\n2. Similarly, the tile at (5,7) also shows a '1', and with (6,6) flagged as a bomb, the remaining adjacent tiles, including (6,7), are safe.\n\nBy ensuring that all adjacent bomb indications are satisfied with the existing flags, we can confidently reveal (6,7) without danger.\n\n**Final Solution Code**\n\nTo make the move in the game, use the following format:\n\n```plaintext\nMOVE: 6,7,false\n```\n\n**Note:** The `false` value for the `flag` parameter indicates that we are revealing the tile, not placing a flag.", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ 2 . . . . . . . .\n2 _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n4 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n7 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 2, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see a 'F' at position (4,0), so that's where one flag is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. I'll start by looking at the revealed numbers and see if I can deduce where some bombs are.\n\nLet's look at row 0:\n\n0: _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1:\n\n1: _ 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2:\n\n2: _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n\nRow 3:\n\n3: _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 4:\n\n4: F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 5:\n\n5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\nRow 6:\n\n6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nRow 7:\n\n7: 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\nRow 8:\n\n8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 9:\n\n9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo, starting from the top-left, there are some revealed numbers and some unexplored spaces.\n\nLet me focus on the area around the flag at (4,0). Since it's a flag, there should be a bomb there. Now, looking at the '1's and '2's around it, I can try to see if there are any forced moves.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 1 and 2, both are '1's. The '.' at (0,3) is unexplored. Similarly, in row 1, column 1 is '2', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 2, where there are more numbers revealed.\n\nIn row 2:\n\nColumn 0: '_', which is revealed empty.\n\nColumn 1: '2'\n\nColumn 2: '.'\n\nColumn 3: '3'\n\nColumn 4: '1'\n\nColumn 5: '2'\n\nColumn 6: '1'\n\nColumn 7: '2'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nSo, at (2,1): '2', which means there are 2 bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nBut (2,0) is revealed empty, so no bomb there. (1,1) is '2', also revealed, so no bomb. (2,2) is '.', unexplored. (3,0) is '_', revealed empty. (3,1) is '1'. (3,2) is '1'. (1,0) is '_', revealed empty. (1,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, adjacent to (2,1), the possible bomb locations are (2,2) and (1,2), since the others are either revealed empty or have numbers.\n\nBut wait, (2,1) is '2', and it has two possible bomb locations: (2,2) and (1,2). So, both of these must have bombs.\n\nBut, hold on, there's a flag already at (4,0), which is below this area. Maybe I should consider that as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at row 3 and row 4 to see how the flag at (4,0) affects the numbers around it.\n\nIn row 3:\n\nColumn 0: '_', revealed empty.\n\nColumn 1: '1'\n\nColumn 2: '1'\n\nColumn 3: '1'\n\nColumn 4: '_'\n\nColumn 5: '_'\n\nColumn 6: '_'\n\nColumn 7: '_'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nIn row 4:\n\nColumn 0: 'F', flagged.\n\nColumn 1: '_'\n\nColumn 2: '_'\n\nColumn 3: '_'\n\nColumn 4: '_'\n\nColumn 5: '_'\n\nColumn 6: '_'\n\nColumn 7: '_'\n\nColumn 8: '1'\n\nColumn 9: '.'\n\nSo, the flag at (4,0) affects the '1's in (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), and (3,8), as well as possibly others.\n\nLet's look at (3,1): '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\n(3,0) is revealed empty, no bomb.\n\n(2,1) is '2', no bomb.\n\n(2,2) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(3,2) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(4,0) is flagged, bomb there.\n\n(4,1) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,2) is '_', revealed empty.\n\nSo, for (3,1): '1', and we know there's a bomb at (4,0), which is one of its neighbors. So, the other neighbors cannot have bombs.\n\nTherefore, (2,2) and (4,1), (4,2) are safe.\n\nWait, but (2,2) is '.', unexplored. Since (3,1) already has its required bomb at (4,0), the other neighbors cannot have bombs. So, (2,2) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): '1'. Its neighbors are:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n(2,1) is '2', no bomb.\n\n(2,2) is '.', but we just deduced it's safe.\n\n(2,3) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(3,1) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(3,3) is '1', no bomb.\n\n(4,1) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,2) is '_', revealed empty.\n\n(4,3) is '_', revealed empty.\n\nSo, for (3,2): '1', and we have a bomb at (4,0), but (4,0) is not adjacent to (3,2). Wait, (4,0) is not adjacent to (3,2). So, the '1' at (3,2) must have its bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nBut none of its adjacent squares are flagged except (4,0), which is not adjacent to it. So, the bomb must be in one of: (2,3), which is '.'.\n\nSo, (2,3) must have a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3): '1'. Its neighbors are:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(2,2) is '.', but we thought it's safe because of (3,1).\n\nWait, but (3,1) only affects its own neighbors, which include (2,2), but (3,2) requires that there is a bomb in its neighborhood, which is at (2,3).\n\nSo, perhaps (2,2) is safe, and (2,3) has a bomb.\n\nNow, looking at (3,3): '1'. Its neighbors are:\n\n- (2,2): safe\n\n- (2,3): bomb\n\n- (2,4): '.'\n\n- (3,2): safe\n\n- (3,4): '.'\n\n- (4,2): safe\n\n- (4,3): safe\n\n- (4,4): '.'\n\nSo, (3,3): '1', and it has a bomb at (2,3), so the other neighbors cannot have bombs. Therefore, (2,4) and (4,4) are safe.\n\nSimilarly, (3,8): '1'.

Maybe I should make a move based on the current analysis, accepting that there might be a mistake, and see what happens.\n\nGiven that, I think the safest move is to flag (1,2): '.' as a bomb.\n\nSo, my move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the analysis of the numbers and existing flags, it seems that (1,2) is likely to be a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 1,2,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ 2 . . . . . . . .\n2 _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n4 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n7 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 2, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 8 flags remaining, which means that 2 flags have already been placed. Looking at the board, I can see two flagged spaces: one at (0,2) and another at (4,0). But wait, let's double-check that.\n\nLooking at row 0: it's (0,0) is '_', (0,1) is '1', (0,2) is '1', (0,3) is '.', and so on. Wait, actually, in row 1, column 2 is 'F', so that's (1,2). And in row 4, column 0 is 'F', which is (4,0). So, there are flags at (1,2) and (4,0).\n\nAlright, now, I need to make sure that the flags are correctly placed and see if I can deduce anything else.\n\nLet's start by looking at the numbers and seeing how they relate to the flags.\n\nFirst, look at (0,1), which is '1'. It's surrounded by (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nCurrently, (0,0) is '_', (0,2) is '1', (1,0) is '_', (1,1) is '2', (1,2) is 'F', (2,0) is '_', (2,1) is '2', (2,2) is '.'.\n\nSo, (0,1) is '1', and it has one flag adjacent at (1,2). So, that satisfies its condition, meaning there should be only one bomb adjacent, which is already flagged.\n\nSimilarly, (0,2) is '1', and it's adjacent to (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n\n(0,1) is '1', (0,3) is '.', (1,1) is '2', (1,2) is 'F', (1,3) is '.', (2,1) is '2', (2,2) is '.', (2,3) is '3'.\n\nSo, (0,2) is '1', and it has one flag adjacent at (1,2). So, that's good.\n\nNow, look at (1,1), which is '2'. It's adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\n(0,0) is '_', (0,1) is '1', (0,2) is '1', (1,0) is '_', (1,2) is 'F', (2,0) is '_', (2,1) is '2', (2,2) is '.'.\n\nSo, (1,1) is '2', and it has one flag adjacent at (1,2). So, it needs one more bomb adjacent. Looking at the adjacent squares, the only unflagged ones are (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2). So, one of these must be a bomb.\n\nBut (2,1) is '2', which is already a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, either (2,0) or (2,2) must be a bomb.\n\nBut (2,2) is '.', which is unexplored, and (2,0) is '_', which is safe.\n\nSo, (2,0) is safe, so it must be (2,2) that's a bomb.\n\nBut wait, (2,2) is '.', which is unexplored. If it's a bomb, I should flag it.\n\nBut let's see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, (1,1) is '2', has one flag at (1,2), and needs one more bomb adjacent. Adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nWe already have (1,2) as a flag, and (2,1) is '2', which can't be a bomb. So, either (2,0) or (2,2) must be a bomb.\n\nBut (2,0) is '_', which is safe, so it must be (2,2) that's a bomb.\n\nTherefore, I should flag (2,2).\n\nBut wait, (2,2) is '.', which is unexplored. If I flag it, it will become 'F'.\n\nBut I have 8 flags remaining, which is more than the number of bombs left, since there are 10 bombs in total and I've already placed 2 flags.\n\nWait, actually, I have 8 flags remaining, which means I've placed 2 flags so far, out of 10 bombs.\n\nSo, I can still place more flags.\n\nBut before placing a flag at (2,2), I need to make sure that it's indeed a bomb.\n\nLooking again at (1,1), which is '2', and it has one flag at (1,2), and needs one more bomb adjacent.\n\nAdjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\n(0,0) is '_', (0,1) is '1', (0,2) is '1', (1,0) is '_', (1,2) is 'F', (2,0) is '_', (2,1) is '2', (2,2) is '.'.\n\nSo, (2,0) is '_', which is safe, so (2,2) must be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, I should flag (2,2).\n\nBut let's check if there are any other possibilities.\n\nLooking at (2,2), which is '.', and if I flag it, I need to ensure that it doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (2,1), which is '2', and it's adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\n\n(1,0) is '_', (1,1) is '2', (1,2) is 'F', (2,0) is '_', (2,2) is '.', (3,0) is '_', (3,1) is '1', (3,2) is '1'.\n\nSo, (2,1) is '2', and it has one flag adjacent at (1,2), and (2,2) is '.', which I'm considering to flag.\n\nIf I flag (2,2), then (2,1) will have two adjacent flags, which matches its '2' value.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is '3', adjacent to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).\n\n(1,2) is 'F', (1,3) is '.', (1,4) is '.', (2,2) is '.', (2,4) is '1', (3,2) is '1', (3,3) is '1', (3,4) is '_'.\n\nSo, (2,3) is '3', and it has one flag adjacent at (1,2), and needs two more bombs adjacent.\n\nAdjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).\n\n(1,3) is '.', (1,4) is '.', (2,2) is '.', (2,4) is '1', (3,2) is '1', (3,3) is '1', (3,4) is '_'.\n\nIf I flag (2,2), then that's one bomb, so I need one more for (2,3).\n\nSo, either (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), etc., must have another bomb.\n\nBut (2,4) is '1', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb.\n\nSo, perhaps (1,3) or (1,4) is a bomb.\n\nBut I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, (1,3) is '.', (1,4) is '.', (2,4) is '1', (3,2) is '1', (3,3) is '1', (3,4) is '_'.\n\nSo, if (2,2) is a bomb, and I need one more bomb for (2,3), it could be either (1,3) or (1,4).\n\nBut (1,3) and (1,4) are both unexplored, so I can't be sure.\n\nBut since I have to place a flag, and I'm fairly confident that (2,2) is a bomb based on (1,1)'s '2' value, I think it's safe to flag (2,2).\n\nAdditionally, once I flag (2,2), I can look at other areas of the board to see if I can reveal any safe tiles.\n\nSo, my next move would be to flag (2,2).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this Minesweeper puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the board state and make logical deductions to determine the safest moves. The goal is to either reveal safe squares or correctly flag bombs without revealing any bombs ourselves.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze Revealed Numbers:**\n   - Each number indicates how many bombs are adjacent to that square.\n   - Use the numbers and existing flags to deduce the locations of unknown bombs.\n\n2. **Check for Obvious Conflicts:**\n   - Ensure that the number of flags around a numbered square matches the number indicated.\n   - Identify squares that must be bombs or must be safe based on the numbers and flags.\n\n3. **Consider Remaining Flags and Bombs:**\n   - Keep track of the remaining flags and bombs to avoid over-flagging or under-flagging.\n\n4. **Make Logical Moves:**\n   - Place flags where bombs are definitely located.\n   - Reveal squares that are definitely safe.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a logical puzzle rather than a coding problem, the \"solution code\" will be a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning process and the final move to be made.\n\n### Solution Explanation\n\nGiven the board state and the rules of Minesweeper, we need to determine the next move. Let's analyze the board step by step.\n\n#### Current Board State\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ 2 F . . . . . . .\n2 _ 2 . 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n4 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n7 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n```\n\n#### Analysis\n\n1. **Flags Placed:**\n   - (1,2) and (4,0)\n\n2. **Remaining Flags:**\n   - 8 flags remaining out of 10 total bombs, meaning 2 flags have already been placed.\n\n3. **Check (0,1) which is '1':**\n   - Adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n   - Flags: (1,2)\n   - Since it's '1', only one adjacent bomb, which is already flagged at (1,2). Therefore, the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\n4. **Check (0,2) which is '1':**\n   - Adjacent squares: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n   - Flags: (1,2)\n   - It's '1', so only one adjacent bomb, which is already flagged at (1,2). Therefore, the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\n5. **Check (1,1) which is '2':**\n   - Adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n   - Flags: (1,2)\n   - It's '2', so it needs two adjacent bombs. One is already flagged at (1,2), so one more bomb is needed in the adjacent squares.\n   - Possible bomb locations: (2,0), (2,2)\n   - (2,0) is '_', which is safe, so (2,2) must be a bomb.\n\n6. **Flag (2,2):**\n   - This satisfies the '2' at (1,1).\n\n7. **Check (2,1) which is '2':**\n   - Adjacent squares: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n   - Flags: (1,2), (2,2)\n   - It's '2', and now has two flags adjacent, which matches the number.\n\n8. **Check (2,3) which is '3':**\n   - Adjacent squares: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n   - Flags: (1,2), (2,2)\n   - It's '3', and has two flags adjacent, so one more bomb is needed in the adjacent squares.\n   - Possible bomb locations: (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nGiven this analysis, the next logical step is to flag (2,2) as a bomb.\n\n### Final Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: Based on the analysis, (2,2) must be a bomb to satisfy the '2' at (1,1). Flagging (2,2) ensures that the conditions for (1,1) and (2,1) are met.\nMOVE: 2,2,true\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **EXPLANATION:** By flagging (2,2), we satisfy the conditions for the '2' at (1,1) and the '2' at (2,1).

So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 7 flags left to place, which means that 3 flags have already been placed. Looking at the board, I can see some flagged spaces and some revealed numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. The board has rows numbered from 0 to 9, top to bottom, and columns from 0 to 9, left to right. The symbols mean:\n\n- `_` is an empty revealed space, meaning no adjacent bombs.\n\n- `.` is an unexplored space.\n\n- `F` is a flagged space, where I think there's a bomb.\n\n- `1` to `8` are numbers indicating how many bombs are adjacent to that cell.\n\n- `*` would mean a revealed bomb, but thankfully, there are none yet.\n\nOkay, so let's start by looking at the areas where I have some information.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n0 1 1 . . . . . . .\n\nColumn 1 has a '1', and column 2 has a '1'.

Let me try to map out the adjacent cells.\n\nLet's consider row 1, column 2, which is '2'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (0,1): '1'\n\n- (0,2): '1'\n\n- (0,3): '.'\n\n- (1,1): '_'\n\n- (1,3): 'F'\n\n- (2,1): '_'\n\n- (2,2): 'F'\n\n- (2,3): '3'\n\nSo, the '2' in (1,2) has two flags adjacent to it: (1,3) and (2,2).\n\nBut wait, '2' means exactly two bombs adjacent. So, if I have two flags adjacent, that should satisfy it, meaning the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nTherefore, the cells (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (2,1), and (2,3) should be safe.\n\nBut wait, (0,1) and (0,2) are already revealed as '1', so they are safe.\n\n(0,3) is unexplored.\n\n(1,1) is revealed as '_', safe.\n\n(2,1) is revealed as '_', safe.\n\n(2,3) is '3', which is already a number.\n\nSo, perhaps I can safely reveal (0,3).\n\nBut let me check the '1's to see if they have their adjacent bombs accounted for.\n\nLooking at (0,1), which is '1'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (0,0): '_'\n\n- (0,2): '1'\n\n- (1,0): '_'\n\n- (1,1): '_'\n\n- (1,2): '2'\n\n- (2,0): '_'\n\n- (2,1): '_'\n\n- (2,2): 'F'\n\nSo, '1' in (0,1) has one flag adjacent in (2,2). Since it's '1', and it already has one flag adjacent, the other adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nTherefore, (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) are safe.\n\nSimilarly, (0,2) is '1', and it has adjacent cells:\n\n- (0,1): '1'\n\n- (0,3): '.'\n\n- (1,1): '_'\n\n- (1,2): '2'\n\n- (1,3): 'F'\n\n- (2,1): '_'\n\n- (2,2): 'F'\n\n- (2,3): '3'\n\nHere, '1' in (0,2) has two adjacent flags: (1,3) and (2,2). But '1' only allows for one adjacent bomb, so this is a conflict.\n\nWait, this is a problem. '1' in (0,2) cannot have two adjacent flags. It can only have one adjacent bomb.\n\nSo, perhaps one of the flags is incorrectly placed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted the adjacent cells.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\n'1' in (0,2) has adjacent cells:\n\n- (0,1): '1' (safe)\n\n- (0,3): '.' (unknown)\n\n- (1,1): '_' (safe)\n\n- (1,2): '2' (number)\n\n- (1,3): 'F' (flagged)\n\n- (2,1): '_' (safe)\n\n- (2,2): 'F' (flagged)\n\n- (2,3): '3' (number)\n\nSo, it has two flagged adjacents: (1,3) and (2,2). But '1' can only have one adjacent bomb. This means that one of these flags is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, at least one of the flags in (1,3) or (2,2) is incorrectly placed.\n\nThis is a critical mistake. I need to correct this.\n\nPerhaps I should remove one of the flags.\n\nBut which one to remove?\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf I remove the flag from (1,3), then '2' in (1,2) would only have one adjacent flag, meaning there should be another bomb adjacent to it.\n\nSimilarly, if I remove the flag from (2,2), then '1' in (0,2) would have only one adjacent flag, which matches its value.\n\nBut '2' in (1,2) would then have only one adjacent flag, meaning there should be another bomb adjacent to it.\n\nLooking at '2' in (1,2), if I remove the flag from (2,2), then I need another bomb adjacent to it.\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (0,1): '1' (safe)\n\n- (0,2): '1' (safe)\n\n- (0,3): '.' (unknown)\n\n- (1,1): '_' (safe)\n\n- (1,3): 'F' (still flagged)\n\n- (2,1): '_' (safe)\n\n- (2,2): '_' (if flag is removed)\n\n- (2,3): '3' (number)\n\nSo, if I remove the flag from (2,2), then '2' in (1,2) would need another bomb adjacent. The only remaining unknown is (0,3).\n\nSimilarly, if I remove the flag from (1,3), then '1' in (0,2) would have only one adjacent flag, which is correct, and '2' in (1,2) would have only one adjacent flag, meaning another bomb is needed in its adjacent cells, which are (0,3) and (2,2).\n\nBut in this case, (2,2) is already flagged, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the flag in (2,2) is incorrect and remove it.\n\nThen, '1' in (0,2) would have only one adjacent flag, which is correct, and '2' in (1,2) would have only one adjacent flag, meaning there should be another bomb adjacent to it, which would be in (0,3) or (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is no longer flagged, so perhaps (0,3) is a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the flag in (1,3) is incorrect.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should look at other parts of the board to find more clues.\n\nLet's look at row 2, column 3, which is '3'.\n\n'3' means there are three adjacent bombs.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,2): '2'\n\n- (1,3): 'F'\n\n- (1,4): '.'\n\n- (2,2): 'F'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '_'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\nSo, '3' in (2,3) has two flagged adjacents: (1,3) and (2,2).\n\nIt needs three adjacent bombs, so there should be one more bomb adjacent to it.\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (1,4): '.' (unknown)\n\n- (2,4): '1' (number)\n\n- (3,3): '1' (number)\n\n- (3,4): '1' (number)\n\nWait, '1' in (2,4) indicates that there is one adjacent bomb.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,3): 'F'\n\n- (1,4): '.'\n\n- (2,3): '3'\n\n- (2,5): '2'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\n- (3,5): '2'\n\n- (2,4): '1' (itself)\n\nSo, '1' in (2,4) has one flag adjacent in (1,3), which satisfies its value, meaning the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nSimilarly, '1' in (3,3) has adjacent cells:\n\n- (2,2): 'F'\n\n- (2,3): '3'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '_'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\n- (4,2): '_'\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\n- (4,4): '_'\n\nWait, but (4,3) is '_', (4,4) is '_', etc.\n\nBut in row 4, column 2 is '_', column 3 is '_', column 4 is '_'.\n\nWait, but row 4, column 0 is 'F'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at row 3 and row 4 more carefully.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to find a safer area to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 5:\n\n_ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\nColumn 5 has '1', column 6 has '1', column 7 has '1', column 8 has '1', column 9 has '1'.\n\nSo, each '1' indicates one adjacent bomb.\n\nLooking at row 6:\n\n1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nSo, in row 6, columns 0,1,2,5,7 are '1', and columns 3,4 are '_', column 6 is '.', column 8 is '_', column 9 is '_'.\n\nSimilarly, row 7:\n\n1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\nRow 8:\n\n3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 9:\n\n. . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThis seems like a different section of the board.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on row 5 and see if I can deduce anything there.\n\nIn row 5, columns 5 to 9 are all '1's.\n\nLooking at column 5, '1', its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSimilarly, column 6 has '1', adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a separate cluster from the top left corner, and perhaps I can make some deductions here.\n\nBut considering the time constraints, maybe I should try to find a safe cell to reveal based on the current information.\n\nLooking back to the top left corner, the conflict between the '1' in (0,2) and the two adjacent flags suggests that at least one of those flags is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps I should remove the flag from (2,2) and see the implications.\n\nIf I remove the flag from (2,2), then '1' in (0,2) would have only one adjacent flag, which is correct, and '2' in (1,2) would have only one adjacent flag, meaning there should be another bomb adjacent to it, which would be in (0,3).\n\nTherefore, (0,3) should be a bomb.\n\nBut wait, (0,3) is currently '.'.\n\nSo, if I flag (0,3), then '2' in (1,2) would have two adjacent flags: (0,3) and (1,3).\n\nWait, but (1,3) is already flagged.\n\nWait, no, (1,3) is 'F', and (0,3) is '.'.\n\nIf I flag (0,3), then '2' in (1,2) would have two adjacent flags: (1,3) and (0,3), which satisfies its value.\n\nSimilarly, '1' in (0,2) would have one adjacent flag: (0,3), which is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps I should place a flag in (0,3).\n\nBut I already have three flags placed, and I have 7 flags left to place, but the total bombs are 10.\n\nWait, actually, I have already placed three flags, and there are 10 bombs, so I have 7 flags left to place, which matches the remaining bombs.\n\nSo, if I place a flag in (0,3), that would be the fourth flag.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that '1' in (0,2) cannot have two adjacent flags, so something is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to remove the flag from (2,2) and place it in (0,3).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nIf I remove the flag from (2,2), then '1' in (0,2) would have only one adjacent flag in (1,3), which is correct.\n\n'2' in (1,2) would have only one adjacent flag in (1,3), meaning there should be another bomb adjacent to it, which would be in (0,3).\n\nSo, I should place a flag in (0,3).\n\nTherefore, my move should be to remove the flag from (2,2) and place it in (0,3).\n\nBut in terms of moves, I can only make one move at a time.\n\nSo, perhaps I should first remove the flag from (2,2).\n\nBut before doing that, maybe I should consider the consequences.\n\nIf I remove the flag from (2,2), then '2' in (1,2) would need another bomb adjacent, which would be in (0,3).\n\nSo, I should then place a flag in (0,3).\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no conflicts elsewhere.\n\nLooking at '3' in (2,3), which needs three adjacent bombs.\n\nCurrently, it has flags in (1,3) and (2,2).\n\nIf I remove the flag from (2,2) and place it in (0,3), then '3' in (2,3) would have flags in (1,3) and (0,3), still needing one more adjacent bomb.\n\nLooking at its adjacent cells:\n\n- (1,2): '2'\n\n- (1,3): 'F'\n\n- (1,4): '.'\n\n- (2,2): '_'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '_'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\nSo, it has flags in (1,3) and (0,3), but (0,3) is not adjacent to '3' in (2,3). Wait, (0,3) is not adjacent to (2,3); they are two rows apart.\n\nWait a minute, adjacency is only to immediate neighboring cells, including diagonals.\n\nSo, (2,3)'s adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nSo, (0,3) is not adjacent to (2,3). Therefore, flagging (0,3) doesn't affect '3' in (2,3).\n\nTherefore, '3' in (2,3) still needs three adjacent flags, and currently has flags in (1,3) and (2,2).\n\nIf I remove the flag from (2,2), it only has one flag adjacent, meaning I need to place two more flags in its adjacent cells.\n\nBut looking at '3' in (2,3), its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,2): '2'\n\n- (1,3): 'F'\n\n- (1,4): '.'\n\n- (2,2): '_'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '_'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\nSo, if I remove the flag from (2,2), then '3' in (2,3) has only one adjacent flag in (1,3).\n\nTherefore, I need to place two more flags in its adjacent cells: (1,4), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).\n\nBut (3,3) is '1', which already has adjacent flags potentially.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the initial assumption was wrong and keep the flag in (2,2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a cell that I'm certain is safe.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 1, which is '_', safe.\n\nAdjacent to it are:\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nWhere:\n\n- (0,0): '_'\n\n- (0,1): '1'\n\n- (0,2): '1'\n\n- (1,0): '_'\n\n- (1,2): '2'\n\n- (2,0): '_'\n\n- (2,1): '_'\n\n- (2,2): 'F'\n\nSo, all these are safe except (2,2), which is flagged.\n\nBut if I consider that the flag in (2,2) is incorrect, then '1' in (0,2) would have only one adjacent flag in (1,3), which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, '2' in (1,2) would have only one adjacent flag in (1,3), meaning there should be another bomb adjacent to it, which would be in (0,3).\n\nTherefore, I should flag (0,3).\n\nSo, my move should be to place a flag in (0,3).\n\nBut before doing that, I need to make sure that I'm not making a mistake.\n\nLooking back, if I place a flag in (0,3), then '1' in (0,2) has one adjacent flag, which is correct.\n\n'2' in (1,2) has two adjacent flags: (1,3) and (0,3), which is correct.\n\n'3' in (2,3) has flags in (1,3) and (0,3), but since (0,3) is not adjacent to (2,3), it still needs another adjacent bomb.\n\nLooking at '3' in (2,3), it needs three adjacent bombs.\n\nCurrently, it has flags in (1,3) and (2,2).\n\nIf I place a flag in (0,3), which is not adjacent to (2,3), then I need to place another flag in its adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at '3' in (2,3), its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,2): '2'\n\n- (1,3): 'F'\n\n- (1,4): '.'\n\n- (2,2): '_'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '_'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\nSo, it has one flag in (1,3), and needs two more.\n\nPossible candidates are (1,4), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).\n\nBut (3,3) is '1', which can only have one adjacent bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is '1', which can only have one adjacent bomb.\n\nThis is getting too tangled.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 9, which is '1'.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (3,8): '1'\n\n- (3,9): '1'\n\n- (4,8): '_'\n\n- (5,8): '_'\n\n- (5,9): '1'\n\n- (4,10): out of bounds\n\nWait, column 9 is the last column, so adjacent cells are:\n\n- (3,8), (3,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9)\n\nGiven that (3,8) is '1', (3,9) is '1', (4,8) is '_', (5,8) is '_', (5,9) is '1'.\n\nSo, '1' in (4,9) has one flag adjacent, which is in (5,9), but (5,9) is '1', which is a number, not a flag.\n\nWait, no, (5,9) is '1', not a flag.\n\nWait, where are the flags in this area?\n\nLooking back, the only flags are in (1,2), (2,2), and (2,3).\n\nSo, in row 4, column 9, '1' has adjacent cells:\n\n- (3,8): '1'\n\n- (3,9): '1'\n\n- (4,8): '_'\n\n- (5,8): '_'\n\n- (5,9): '1'\n\nNone of these are flagged, so it must have a bomb in one of its adjacent unflagged cells.\n\nBut all adjacent cells are either numbers or empty spaces, so perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look elsewhere.\n\nTime is limited, so maybe I should just pick a cell that seems safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 7, which is '1'.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (5,6): '1'\n\n- (5,7): '1'\n\n- (5,8): '1'\n\n- (6,6): '1'\n\n- (6,8): '_'\n\n- (7,6): '1'\n\n- (7,7): '1'\n\n- (7,8): '1'\n\nSo, '1' in (6,7) has one adjacent flag, which is in (6,8), assuming I flag (6,8).\n\nWait, no, (6,8) is '_', which is safe.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see the flags around here.\n\nBut in this area, there are no flags, so '1' in (6,7) indicates that one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\nGiven that (6,8) is '_', which is safe, the bomb must be elsewhere.\n\nWait, but (6,8) is '_', meaning it's safe, so the bomb must be in one of the other adjacent cells: (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8).\n\nBut all these cells are '1's or '_'.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a cell with a high probability of being safe.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 2, which is '2'.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3)\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (7,1): '1'\n\n- (7,2): '1'\n\n- (7,3): '1'\n\n- (8,1): '3'\n\n- (8,3): '2'\n\n- (9,1): '3'\n\n- (9,2): '3'\n\n- (9,3): '2'\n\nSo, '2' in (8,2) has no flags adjacent, and all adjacent cells are numbers, meaning bombs must be in some of these numbered cells.\n\nThis is too vague to make a decision.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should just pick a cell to reveal that seems safe.\n\nLooking back to the top left corner, if I place a flag in (0,3), then perhaps I can reveal (0,4), assuming it's safe.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal (3,5), which is currently '.'.\n\nBut again, I don't have enough information.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I think the safest move is to reveal a cell that is unlikely to be a bomb based on the current flags.\n\nSo, I'll choose to reveal (0,4).\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the confusion in the top left corner and the need to resolve flag conflicts, I'm choosing to reveal (0,4), which is adjacent to the numbered cells and should provide more information without immediately triggering a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 0,4,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ 2 F . . . . . . .\n2 _ 2 F 3 1 2 1

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 7 flags left to place, which means that 3 flags have already been placed. Looking at the board, I can see some flagged spaces and some revealed numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. The board has numbers from 1 to 3, and some empty spaces represented by underscores. There are also some unexplored spaces denoted by dots and flagged spaces by 'F'.\n\nLet me try to analyze the areas where I have some information.\n\nStarting from the top-left corner:\n\nRow 0:\n\n0: _ 1 1 2 1 2 . . . .\n\n1: _ 2 F 3 . 2 . . . .\n\n2: _ 2 F 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n\n3: _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\n4: F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\n5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\n6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\n7: 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\n8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nOkay, so in row 0, columns 1 through 5 have numbers 1,1,2,1,2, and then the rest are unexplored.\n\nIn row 1, column 2 and 3 are flagged, and there are numbers 2,3, and 2.\n\nSimilarly, in row 2, columns 2 and 3 are flagged, and numbers 2,3,1,2,1.\n\nRow 3 has some 1's and empty spaces.\n\nRow 4 has a flagged space in column 0, and an empty space in column 8.\n\nRow 5 has some 1's and empty spaces.\n\nRow 6 has 1's and some unexplored spaces.\n\nRow 7 has 1's and some unexplored spaces.\n\nRow 8 has 3's, 3's, 2's, and mostly unexplored.\n\nRow 9 has some unexplored spaces and a 1.\n\nAlright, so my goal is to either reveal a safe space or place a flag where there's likely a bomb.\n\nLet me look for areas where I can deduce the positions of bombs with certainty.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n\nColumn 1 has a 1. That means there's one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent spaces are:\n\n- (0,0): empty\n\n- (0,2): 1\n\n- (1,0): empty\n\n- (1,1): 2\n\n- (1,2): F\n\nSo, the bomb could be in (0,0), (1,0), or (1,1). But (1,2) is flagged, which might be one of the bombs.\n\nWait, but (1,1) is a 2, which means it has two bombs adjacent to it. Its adjacent spaces are:\n\n- (0,0): empty\n\n- (0,1): 1\n\n- (0,2): 1\n\n- (1,0): empty\n\n- (1,2): F\n\n- (2,0): empty\n\n- (2,1): 2\n\n- (2,2): F\n\nSo, for (1,1) to have two bombs adjacent, and considering (1,2) is flagged, there must be another bomb adjacent to it. Possible spaces are (0,0), (1,0), or (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is a 2, which means it has two bombs adjacent to it. Its adjacent spaces are:\n\n- (1,0): empty\n\n- (1,1): 2\n\n- (1,2): F\n\n- (2,0): empty\n\n- (2,2): F\n\n- (3,0): empty\n\n- (3,1): 1\n\n- (3,2): 1\n\nSo, (2,1) needs two bombs adjacent. It already has (1,2) flagged, so another bomb must be in (1,0), (2,0), or (3,1).\n\nWait, but (3,1) is a 1, which has one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent spaces are:\n\n- (2,0): empty\n\n- (2,1): 2\n\n- (2,2): F\n\n- (3,0): empty\n\n- (3,2): 1\n\n- (4,0): F\n\n- (4,1): empty\n\n- (4,2): empty\n\nSo, for (3,1) to have one bomb adjacent, and considering (2,2) is flagged, and (4,0) is flagged, that might be enough, but I need to check.\n\nWait, let's try to map out the flagged spaces and see if they satisfy the numbers.\n\nFlagged spaces are at:\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (4,0)\n\nWait, but in row 1, column 3 is also flagged.\n\nSo, total flags placed so far: 5 flags.\n\nWait, the game info says flags remaining: 7, and bombs: 10, so 3 flags have been placed.\n\nBut according to the board, I see more than 3 flags. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me recount the flags on the board.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: column 2 and 3 are flagged.\n\nRow 2: column 2 and 3 are flagged.\n\nRow 4: column 0 is flagged.\n\nSo, that's 5 flags.\n\nBut the game says flags remaining: 7, which would imply that total flags placed is 10 - 7 = 3 flags placed.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent with what I see on the board.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'F' represents a revealed bomb, not a flag.\n\nWait, no, the legend says:\n\n- F : Flagged space\n\n- * : Revealed bomb (game over)\n\nSo, 'F' is a flag, not a revealed bomb.\n\nBut if 5 flags are on the board, and flags remaining is 7, that would mean total flags to place is 12, but the game says bombs are 10.\n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the game info.\n\nGame info says:\n\n- Flags remaining: 7\n\n- Bombs: 10\n\nSo, if total bombs are 10, and flags remaining are 7, that means 10 - 7 = 3 flags have been placed.\n\nBut on the board, I see more than 3 flags. Wait, maybe some flags are on non-bomb spaces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'F' represents both flags and revealed bombs.\n\nWait, no, the legend clearly says:\n\n- F : Flagged space\n\n- * : Revealed bomb (game over)\n\nSo, 'F' is only flags.\n\nBut if only 3 flags have been placed, but I see more than 3 'F's on the board, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps some 'F's are from previous moves and have been removed, but still shown.\n\nThis doesn't make sense. I need to clarify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the game allows placing more flags than the number of bombs, but that contradicts the game info.\n\nWait, in standard Minesweeper, you can't place more flags than the number of bombs.\n\nWait, perhaps the game allows it, but in this case, it's showing more flags than bombs.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'F's on the board are not all flags placed by the player; maybe some are pre-existing.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the board provided.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the assumption that the flags on the board are correctly counted, and the game info might be incorrect.\n\nSo, if I see 5 flags on the board, I'll assume that's correct, and proceed accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flags remaining is actually 5, but maybe there's a typo.\n\nWait, no, the game info says flags remaining: 7, bombs:10.\n\nSo, if 10 bombs and 7 flags remaining, that means 3 flags have been placed.\n\nBut on the board, I see more than 3 flags.\n\nThis inconsistency is confusing.\n\nTo resolve this, perhaps I should consider that some flags might have been placed and then removed, but still shown on the board.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the game allows overflagging, meaning placing more flags than the number of bombs.\n\nBut typically, Minesweeper doesn't allow that.\n\nGiven this confusion, I'll proceed by focusing on the board and the numbers, assuming that the flags on the board are correct, and try to find a safe move or a place to flag.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\nColumn 1 has a 1, and its adjacent spaces are:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (0,2)\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,2): flagged\n\nSo, since it's a 1, and there's already one flag adjacent, the other adjacent spaces should be safe.\n\nTherefore, (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), and (1,1) should be safe.\n\nBut (1,1) is a 2, which means it has two bombs adjacent.\n\nIts adjacent spaces are:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (0,1):1\n\n- (0,2):1\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (1,2):flagged\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (2,1):2\n\n- (2,2):flagged\n\nSo, (1,1) needs two bombs adjacent.\n\nIt already has one flagged bomb at (1,2), so another bomb must be in one of its adjacent spaces: (0,0), (1,0), (2,1), or (2,2):flagged.\n\nBut (2,2) is already flagged, so perhaps that's the second bomb.\n\nBut wait, if (2,2) is flagged, then (1,1) has two flagged bombs adjacent: (1,2) and (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is flagged, so that should count as a bomb.\n\nTherefore, for (1,1), which is a 2, having two flagged bombs adjacent satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, the remaining adjacent spaces to (1,1) should be safe: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nBut (0,1) is a 1, which we've already considered.\n\nSo, perhaps (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), and (2,0) are safe.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is a 2, which needs two bombs adjacent.\n\nIts adjacent spaces are:\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (1,1):2\n\n- (1,2):flagged\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (2,2):flagged\n\n- (3,0)\n\n- (3,1):1\n\n- (3,2):1\n\nSo, (2,1) needs two bombs adjacent.\n\nIt already has two flagged bombs adjacent: (1,2) and (2,2).\n\nTherefore, the remaining adjacent spaces should be safe: (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\n\nSo, (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0) are potential safe spaces.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0:\n\n(3,0) is empty, adjacent to (2,0): possibly safe.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is a 1, which needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nIts adjacent spaces are:\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (2,1):2\n\n- (2,2):flagged\n\n- (3,0)\n\n- (3,2):1\n\n- (4,0):flagged\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (4,2)\n\nSo, for (3,1), which is a 1, it needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nAdjacent spaces include (2,2):flagged, (4,0):flagged.\n\nSo, it already has at least one flagged bomb adjacent.\n\nTherefore, the other adjacent spaces should be safe: (2,0), (3,0), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2).\n\nSo, multiple spaces seem safe.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 0 is flagged.\n\nRow 4, column 8 is empty.\n\nRow 5 has some 1's and empty spaces.\n\nRow 6 has 1's and some unexplored spaces.\n\nRow 7 has 1's and some unexplored spaces.\n\nRow 8 has 3's, 3's, 2's, and mostly unexplored.\n\nRow 9 has some unexplored spaces and a 1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can look at row 8, which has high numbers, indicating multiple bombs adjacent.\n\nRow 8:\n\n(8,0):3\n\n(8,1):3\n\n(8,2):2\n\nAll these have numbers, indicating bombs adjacent.\n\nLooking at (8,0):3\n\nIts adjacent spaces are:\n\n- (7,0):1\n\n- (7,1):.\n\n- (7,2):1\n\n- (8,1):3\n\n- (8,3):_\n\n- (9,0):.\n\n- (9,1):.\n\n- (9,2):1\n\nSo, (8,0) has a 3, meaning three bombs adjacent.\n\nAdjacent spaces include (7,1), (8,1), (8,3), (9,0), (9,1).\n\nBut currently, no flags are in these positions.\n\nSimilarly, (8,1):3\n\nAdjacent spaces:\n\n- (7,0):1\n\n- (7,1):.\n\n- (7,2):1\n\n- (7,3):_\n\n- (8,0):3\n\n- (8,2):2\n\n- (8,3):_\n\n- (8,4):_\n\n- (9,1):.\n\n- (9,2):1\n\n- (9,3):_\n\nSo, (8,1):3 needs three bombs adjacent.\n\nCurrently, no flags in its adjacent spaces.\n\nSimilarly, (8,2):2\n\nAdjacent spaces:\n\n- (7,1):.\n\n- (7,2):1\n\n- (7,3):_\n\n- (8,1):3\n\n- (8,3):_\n\n- (9,1):.\n\n- (9,2):1\n\n- (9,3):_\n\nNeeds two bombs adjacent.\n\nNo flags in these areas.\n\nSo, in row 8, there are high numbers indicating multiple bombs adjacent, but no flags placed there yet.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should look for places to flag in row 8.\n\nBut first, I need to ensure that placing flags there doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look elsewhere where I can make safer deductions.\n\nLooking back at row 0:\n\nWe have (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0) that seem safe based on earlier analysis.\n\nLet me check (3,0):\n\nIt's adjacent to (2,0), (2,1):2, (2,2):flagged, (3,1):1, (3,2):1, (4,0):flagged, (4,1), (4,2).\n\nFrom earlier, it seems safe.\n\nSimilarly, (2,0) seems safe.\n\nSo, perhaps I can reveal (2,0).\n\nBut before doing that, let me check if there's a better move.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 0 is flagged.\n\nRow 4, column 8 is empty.\n\nLooking at (4,8):1\n\nIts adjacent spaces are:\n\n- (3,7):_\n\n- (3,8):1\n\n- (3,9):_\n\n- (4,7):_\n\n- (4,9):_\n\n- (5,7):_\n\n- (5,8):1\n\n- (5,9):1\n\nSo, (4,8):1 needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nAdjacent spaces include (3,8):1, (4,7), (4,9), (5,8):1, (5,9):1.\n\nLooking at (3,8):1\n\nIts adjacent spaces are:\n\n- (2,7):_\n\n- (2,8):2\n\n- (2,9):1\n\n- (3,7):_\n\n- (3,9):_\n\n- (4,7):_\n\n- (4,8):1\n\n- (4,9):_\n\nSo, (3,8):1 needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nPossible spaces: (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9).\n\nSimilarly, (5,8):1 needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nIts adjacent spaces are:\n\n- (4,7):_\n\n- (4,8):1\n\n- (4,9):_\n\n- (5,7):_\n\n- (5,9):1\n\n- (6,7):_\n\n- (6,8):1\n\n- (6,9):1\n\nSo, (5,8):1 needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nPossible spaces: (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9).\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, and I might not be able to deduce anything conclusive here quickly.\n\nLet me look back to row 8.\n\n(8,0):3 needs three bombs adjacent.\n\nAdjacent spaces: (7,0):1, (7,1):., (7,2):1, (8,1):3, (8,3):_, (9,0):., (9,1):., (9,2):1\n\nCurrently, no flags in these areas.\n\nSimilarly, (8,1):3 needs three bombs adjacent.\n\nAdjacent spaces: (7,0):1, (7,1):., (7,2):1, (7,3):_, (8,0):3, (8,2):2, (8,3):_, (8,4):_, (9,1):., (9,2):1, (9,3):_\n\nNeeds three bombs adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (8,2):2 needs two bombs adjacent.\n\nAdjacent spaces: (7,1):., (7,2):1, (7,3):_, (8,1):3, (8,3):_, (9,1):., (9,2):1, (9,3):_\n\nNeeds two bombs adjacent.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider that the bombs are in (7,1), (8,1), and (9,1).\n\nBut that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a space that is dangerous to reveal and should be flagged.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps I should look for a safer space to reveal.\n\nLooking back at row 0:\n\n(0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0) seem safe based on earlier analysis.\n\nLet me check (2,0):\n\nIt's adjacent to (1,0), (1,1):2, (1,2):flagged, (2,1):2, (2,2):flagged, (3,0), (3,1):1, (3,2):1.\n\nFrom earlier, it seems safe.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0) seems safe.\n\nSo, perhaps I can reveal (1,0).\n\nBut before doing that, let me check if there's any conflict.\n\n(1,0) is adjacent to (0,0):_, (0,1):1, (1,1):2, (1,2):flagged, (2,0):_, (2,1):2, (2,2):flagged, (3,0):_, (3,1):1.\n\nGiven that, and considering the numbers, it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I think revealing (1,0) is a safe move.\n\n**Final Solution**\nTo make progress in this Minesweeper game, we need to carefully analyze the board to determine safe moves or places to flag potential bombs. Given the complexity of the board, we'll focus on areas with clear indications of safe spaces or definite bomb locations.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze Revealed Numbers:** Look at the numbers on the board and the flags already placed to determine the locations of bombs and safe spaces.\n2. **Check for Obvious Flags:** Identify spaces that must be bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n3. **Find Safe Spaces:** Identify spaces that are definitely safe to reveal because they cannot be bombs based on the numbers and flags.\n4. **Make a Move:** Choose to either reveal a safe space or flag a bomb based on the analysis.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a logical analysis problem rather than a coding problem, the \"solution code\" will be the coordinates and action (reveal or flag) based on the analysis.\n\n### Explanation\n\nAfter analyzing the board, particularly focusing on row 0 and row 1, we can deduce that several spaces are safe to reveal. For instance, spaces (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), and (2,0) appear to be safe based on the adjacent numbers and flags.\n\nLet's focus on space (1,0):\n\n- **Adjacent Spaces:**\n  - (0,0): Unrevealed\n  - (0,1): 1\n  - (1,1): 2\n  - (1,2): Flagged\n  - (2,0): Unrevealed\n  - (2,1): 2\n  - (2,2): Flagged\n  - (3,0): Unrevealed\n  - (3,1): 1\n\n- **Analysis:**\n  - The '1' at (0,1) has one flagged adjacent bomb at (1,2), so its requirement is satisfied. Thus, other adjacent spaces like (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), and (1,1) should be safe.\n  - The '2' at (1,1) has two flagged adjacent bombs at (1,2) and (2,2), satisfying its requirement. Therefore, other adjacent spaces like (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), and (2,1) should be safe.\n  - The '2' at (2,1) has two flagged adjacent bombs at (1,2) and (2,2), satisfying its requirement. Thus, spaces like (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), and (3,2) should be safe.\n\nGiven this analysis, revealing space (1,0) seems to be a safe move.\n\n### Final Move\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: Based on the analysis of adjacent numbers and flags, space (1,0) is determined to be safe.\nMOVE: 1,0,false\n```\n\n### Note\n\n- **Coordinates:** (1,0)\n- **Action:** Reveal (flag=false)\n\nThis move should help expand the safe area on the board without hitting a bomb.", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 2 1 2 . . . .\n1 _ 2 F 3 . 2 . . . .\n2 _ 2 F 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n4 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n7 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 7 flags left to place, which means that 3 flags have already been placed. Looking at the board, I can see some flagged spaces and some revealed numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. The board has numbers from 1 to 3, and some empty spaces represented by underscores, unexplored spaces by dots, and flagged spaces by F. There's also one revealed bomb marked as 'F' in row 4, column 0, but I think that might be a mistake because 'F' usually represents a flagged space, not a revealed bomb. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be '*', but I'll assume it's a flagged space for now.\n\nLet me try to analyze the board step by step.\n\nStarting from the top-left corner:\n\nRow 0:\n\n0: _ 1 1 2 1 2 . . . .\n\n1: _ 2 F 3 . 2 . . . .\n\n2: _ 2 F 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n\n3: _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\n4: F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\n5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\n6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\n7: 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\n8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nOkay, so in row 0, column 0 is empty, and adjacent to it are 1s and 2s. Let's look at row 1, column 2 and 3, which are flagged. I need to see if these flags make sense based on the numbers around them.\n\nLet's look at row 1, column 3, which is a '3'. It's adjacent to two flagged spaces, so that means there should be one more bomb adjacent to it.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 5, which is a '2', and it's adjacent to one flagged space, so it needs another bomb adjacent.\n\nRow 2, column 3 is a '3', adjacent to two flagged spaces, so it needs one more bomb adjacent.\n\nRow 4, column 0 is flagged, and row 4, column 8 is a '1', which is adjacent to one flagged space, so it can't have any more bombs adjacent.\n\nRow 5, column 5 to 9 have numbers 1,1,1,1,1, which suggests a possible line of safe spaces or bombs around them.\n\nRow 6 and 7 have some revealed numbers adjacent to unexplored spaces.\n\nI think I should look for areas where I can deduce the exact positions of bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\nLet me look at row 1, column 3, which is a '3'. It's adjacent to row 0, column 2 and 3; row 1, column 2 and 4; row 2, column 2 and 3. Among these, row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 3 are flagged. So, it needs one more bomb adjacent. The possible spots are row 0, column 3; row 1, column 4; row 2, column 2.\n\nBut row 0, column 3 is a '2', which is adjacent to row 0, column 2 and 3; row 1, column 2 and 3; row 2, column 2 and 3. Row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 3 are flagged, so row 0, column 3's two adjacent bombs are already accounted for. Therefore, row 1, column 4 cannot be a bomb, because '3' needs only one more bomb, and it's already satisfied by the flagged spaces.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nRow 1, column 3 is a '3', adjacent to:\n\n- row 0, column 2: empty\n\n- row 0, column 3: '2'\n\n- row 1, column 2: flagged\n\n- row 1, column 4: unexplored\n\n- row 2, column 2: flagged\n\n- row 2, column 3: '3'\n\n- row 1, column 3: '3' (itself)\n\n- row 0, column 4: unexplored\n\nWait, actually, the adjacent cells to row 1, column 3 are:\n\n- row 0, column 2 to 4\n\n- row 1, column 2 to 4\n\n- row 2, column 2 to 4\n\nBut in the board, row 1, column 3 is a '3', and row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 3 are flagged. So, it needs one more bomb adjacent.\n\nThe possible spots for the third bomb are row 0, column 3 (which is a '2'), but that '2' already has two adjacent flags (row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 3), so it cannot have another bomb adjacent. Therefore, the only possible spot for the third bomb adjacent to row 1, column 3 is row 1, column 4.\n\nTherefore, row 1, column 4 must be a bomb.\n\nBut wait, row 1, column 4 is currently unexplored. So, I should place a flag there.\n\nBut before doing that, let me check if placing a flag there would conflict with other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 5, which is a '2', adjacent to row 0, column 4 to 6; row 1, column 4 to 6; row 2, column 4 to 6.\n\nRow 1, column 4 is going to be flagged, and row 2, column 5 is a '2', which is adjacent to row 1, column 4 to 6; row 2, column 4 to 6; row 3, column 4 to 6.\n\nWait, maybe it's getting too complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me look at row 4, column 0, which is flagged. Assuming it's a flagged bomb, then row 4, column 8 is a '1', adjacent to row 3, column 7 to 9; row 4, column 7 to 9; row 5, column 7 to 9.\n\nRow 4, column 8 is a '1', and row 4, column 0 is flagged, but that's not adjacent. Wait, row 4, column 8 is adjacent to row 3, column 7 to 9; row 4, column 7 to 9; row 5, column 7 to 9.\n\nSo, row 4, column 8's '1' must have only one bomb adjacent, which could be in row 4, column 7 or 9, or row 5, column 8, etc.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look at another area.\n\nLet me look at row 5, column 5 to 9, which are all '1's. This suggests a possible line of safe spaces or bombs around them.\n\nRow 5, column 5: '1', adjacent to row 4, column 4 to 6; row 5, column 4 to 6; row 6, column 4 to 6.\n\nSimilarly, row 5, column 6: '1', adjacent to row 4, column 5 to 7; row 5, column 5 to 7; row 6, column 5 to 7.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nGiven that they are all '1's, and assuming that the bombs are placed in such a way that each '1' has exactly one adjacent bomb, I might be able to deduce the positions.\n\nBut this seems a bit too broad to start with. Maybe I should look for areas with higher numbers that can give me more concrete information.\n\nLooking back at row 1, column 3, which is a '3', and already has two adjacent flags, so it needs one more bomb adjacent.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the only possible spot for that bomb is row 1, column 4.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 3 is a '3', adjacent to row 1, column 2 to 4; row 2, column 2 to 4; row 3, column 2 to 4.\n\nRow 2, column 3 is a '3', and row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 2 are flagged, so it needs one more bomb adjacent.\n\nThe possible spots are row 1, column 3; row 2, column 4; row 3, column 2 to 3.\n\nBut row 1, column 3 is a '2', which already has two adjacent flags, so it cannot have another bomb adjacent.\n\nTherefore, the bomb must be either in row 2, column 4 or row 3, column 2 or 3.\n\nBut row 3, column 2 is '_', which is empty, and row 3, column 3 is '_', which is also empty.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 4 is '.' unexplored.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to determine where the bomb is between these options.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at row 1, column 5, which is a '2', adjacent to row 0, column 4 to 6; row 1, column 4 to 6; row 2, column 4 to 6.\n\nRow 1, column 5 is a '2', and if row 1, column 4 is a bomb (which we deduced earlier), then it needs one more bomb adjacent.\n\nThe possible spots are row 0, column 5; row 1, column 6; row 2, column 5.\n\nRow 0, column 5 is a '2', which already has two adjacent flags; row 1, column 6 is '.'; row 2, column 5 is a '2'.\n\nSo, row 1, column 5 needs one more bomb adjacent, and the only possible spot is row 1, column 6.\n\nTherefore, row 1, column 6 must be a bomb.\n\nSo, I should place a flag there.\n\nBut wait, if I place a flag in row 1, column 6, then let's see how it affects other numbers.\n\nRow 2, column 5 is a '2', adjacent to row 1, column 4 to 6; row 2, column 4 to 6; row 3, column 4 to 6.\n\nIf row 1, column 6 is a bomb, then row 2, column 5's '2' would have two adjacent bombs: row 1, column 6 and row 1, column 4 (which we already deduced is a bomb).\n\nSo, that satisfies row 2, column 5's '2'.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 5's '2' would have row 1, column 4 and row 1, column 6 as bombs, which satisfies it.\n\nSo, placing flags in row 1, column 4 and row 1, column 6 seems consistent.\n\nNow, with that in mind, let's look at row 2, column 3's '3', which is adjacent to row 1, column 2 to 4; row 2, column 2 to 4; row 3, column 2 to 4.\n\nRow 1, column 2 is flagged, row 1, column 4 is a bomb (flagged), and row 2, column 2 is flagged.\n\nSo, row 2, column 3's '3' has three adjacent bombs, which satisfies it.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it only needed one more bomb.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nRow 2, column 3 is a '3', adjacent to:\n\n- row 1, column 2: flagged\n\n- row 1, column 3: '2'\n\n- row 1, column 4: bomb (flagged)\n\n- row 2, column 2: flagged\n\n- row 2, column 4: '.' unexplored\n\n- row 3, column 2: '_'\n\n- row 3, column 3: '_'\n\n- row 3, column 4: '.'\n\nSo, it's adjacent to three flagged spaces (row 1, column 2; row 1, column 4; row 2, column 2), which satisfies its '3'. So, no more bombs can be adjacent to it.\n\nTherefore, row 2, column 4 cannot be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, row 3, column 2 and 3 cannot be bombs.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal row 2, column 4; row 3, column 2; and row 3, column 3.\n\nLet me check row 2, column 4.\n\nRow 2, column 4 is '.' unexplored.\n\nIf I reveal it, what will happen?\n\nWell, based on the surrounding numbers, since row 2, column 3's '3' already has its required bombs, row 2, column 4 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 3, column 2 and 3 are '_' empty, so they are already safe.\n\nWait, but row 3, column 2 and 3 are '_', which means they are already revealed empty spaces.\n\nSo, perhaps I should reveal row 2, column 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at other areas.\n\nLet me look at row 6, column 5, which is a '1', adjacent to row 5, column 4 to 6; row 6, column 4 to 6; row 7, column 4 to 6.\n\nRow 6, column 5 is a '1', and if I look at row 5, column 5 to 9, which are all '1's, it might be a long chain, but it's too big to handle right now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at row 8, which has '3','3','2'.\n\nRow 8, column 0: '3', adjacent to row 7, column 0 to 2; row 8, column 1 to 3; row 9, column 1 to 3.\n\nRow 8, column 1: '3', adjacent to row 7, column 1 to 3; row 8, column 0 to 2; row 9, column 0 to 2.\n\nRow 8, column 2: '2', adjacent to row 7, column 2 to 4; row 8, column 1 to 3; row 9, column 1 to 3.\n\nLooking at these, there are no flags around them yet, and they are connected to unexplored spaces.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the earlier deduction and place flags in row 1, column 4 and row 1, column 6.\n\nBut wait, I've already decided that row 1, column 4 needs to be flagged, and row 1, column 6 needs to be flagged.\n\nGiven that, and considering that I have 7 flags left to place, and need to place 10 bombs in total, but already have 3 flags placed, so I need to place 7 more flags.\n\nIf I place flags in row 1, column 4 and row 1, column 6, that would use up 2 of the remaining 7 flags, leaving me with 5 flags to place.\n\nThen, I need to look for other areas to place the remaining flags.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other obvious spots to flag.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5 to 9, which are all '1's, and surrounded by unexplored spaces.\n\nThis could be a area where bombs are located in a specific pattern.\n\nBut it's a bit too broad for me to make a precise deduction right now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for areas where the number of possible bomb placements is limited.\n\nWait, maybe I should look back at row 1, column 3's '3' and row 2, column 3's '3', which are already satisfied with the flags.\n\nThen, perhaps I can look at row 0, column 3's '2', which is adjacent to row 0, column 2 to 4; row 1, column 2 to 4; row 2, column 2 to 4.\n\nRow 0, column 3's '2' has two adjacent flags (row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 3), so no more bombs can be adjacent to it.\n\nTherefore, row 0, column 4 cannot be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 4 is already flagged as a bomb.\n\nSo, row 0, column 4 is safe to reveal.\n\nWait, that could be a good move.\n\nLet me check that again.\n\nRow 0, column 3 is a '2', adjacent to:\n\n- row 0, column 2: '_'\n\n- row 0, column 4: '.'\n\n- row 1, column 2: 'F'\n\n- row 1, column 3: '3'\n\n- row 1, column 4: '.' (to be flagged)\n\n- row 2, column 2: 'F'\n\n- row 2, column 3: '3'\n\n- row 2, column 4: '.'\n\nSince row 0, column 3's '2' already has two adjacent flags (row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 2), no more bombs can be adjacent to it.\n\nTherefore, row 0, column 4 cannot be a bomb.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal row 0, column 4.\n\nLet me make that my next move.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Row 0, column 3 is a '2' with two adjacent flags, so no more adjacent bombs; therefore, row 0, column 4 is safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,4,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 2 1 2 . . . .\n1 _ 2 F 3 . 2 . . . .\n2 _ 2 F 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n4 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n7 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 8, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 7 flags left to place, which means that 3 flags have already been placed. Looking at the board, I can see some flagged spaces and some revealed numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. The board has numbers from 1 to 3, and some empty spaces represented by underscores, unexplored spaces by dots, and flagged spaces by F. There's also one revealed bomb marked as 'F' in row 4, column 0, but I think that might be a mistake because 'F' usually represents a flagged space, not a revealed bomb. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be '*', but I'll assume it's a flagged space for now.\n\nLet me try to analyze the board step by step.\n\nStarting from the top-left corner:\n\nRow 0:\n\n0: _ 1 1 2 1 2 . . . .\n\n1: _ 2 F 3 . 2 . . . .\n\n2: _ 2 F 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n\n3: _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\n4: F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\n5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\n6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\n7: 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\n8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nOkay, so in row 0, column 0 is empty, and adjacent to it are 1s and 2s. Let's look at row 1, column 2 and 3, which are flagged. I need to see if these flags make sense based on the numbers around them.\n\nLet's look at row 1, column 3, which is a '3'. It's adjacent to two flagged spaces, so that means there should be one more bomb adjacent to it. Similarly, row 2, column 3 is a '3' adjacent to two flagged spaces, so again, one more bomb adjacent.\n\nWait, but row 1, column 3 is a '3', and it's adjacent to row 1, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 3 (flagged), row 2, column 4 (unrevealed), row 1, column 4 (unrevealed), row 0, column 3 (empty), row 0, column 4 (1), and row 0, column 5 (2).\n\nSo, it's adjacent to three flagged spaces, which satisfies the '3'. Wait, but according to the board, row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 2 are flagged, and row 2, column 3 is flagged. So that's three flags, which matches the '3'. Good.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 3 is a '3', adjacent to row 1, column 2 (flagged), row 1, column 3 (3), row 2, column 2 (flagged), row 3, column 2 (1), row 3, column 3 (1), row 3, column 4 (1), row 2, column 4 (1), and row 1, column 4 (unrevealed). Wait, but row 2, column 3 is flagged, so that might be confusing.\n\nWait, actually, if a space is flagged, it's considered to be a bomb, so the '3' in row 1, column 3 is adjacent to three flagged spaces, which satisfies its count. Similarly, the '3' in row 2, column 3 is adjacent to two flagged spaces (row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 2), and row 3, column 3 is empty, but it's a '1', which might not make sense. Wait, row 3, column 3 is a '1', adjacent to row 2, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 3 (flagged), row 2, column 4 (1), row 4, column 3 (unrevealed), row 4, column 2 (unrevealed), row 4, column 4 (unrevealed), row 3, column 2 (1), and row 3, column 4 (1). So, it's adjacent to two flagged spaces, but it's a '1', which suggests that only one of those is actually a bomb. So, there might be a mistake in the flags.\n\nWait, maybe the 'F' in row 4, column 0 is actually a revealed bomb, and the flags are elsewhere. I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to count the flags again. In the board, I see flags at:\n\n- row 1, column 2\n\n- row 2, column 2\n\n- row 2, column 3\n\nThat's three flags, which matches the 7 flags remaining out of 10 total bombs, meaning 3 have been placed and 7 are left to place.\n\nBut wait, the game info says flags remaining: 7, bombs:10, so 3 flags have been placed. But on the board, I only see three 'F's. Maybe there are more flags elsewhere that I'm not seeing.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nRow 1: column 2 is F\n\nRow 2: column 2 is F, column 3 is F\n\nRow 4: column 0 is F\n\nSo that's four flags placed, which would mean flags remaining should be 6, but the game says 7 flags remaining. That's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the board representation.\n\nI'll assume that the 'F' in row 4, column 0 is a revealed bomb, not a flag, to make the flag count consistent.\n\nSo, if row 4, column 0 is a revealed bomb, and the flags are only at row 1,2; row 2,2; and row 2,3, that's three flags, and flags remaining is 7, which matches the game info.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\n- row 4, column 0 is a revealed bomb '*'\n\nNow, the board makes more sense.\n\nSo, the board should be:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 _ 1 1 2 1 2 . . . .\n\n1 _ 2 F 3 . 2 . . . .\n\n2 _ 2 F 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\n4 * _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\n7 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\n8 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nNow, with this correction, I can proceed.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that the placed flags are correct and that I don't have any contradictions.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 3, which is a '3', adjacent to row 1, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 3 (flagged), row 1, column 4 (unrevealed), row 0, column 3 (empty), row 0, column 4 (1), row 0, column 5 (2), and row 1, column 5 (2).\n\nSo, '3' is adjacent to three flagged spaces, which satisfies its count. Good.\n\nNow, looking at row 2, column 3, which is a '3', adjacent to row 1, column 2 (flagged), row 1, column 3 (3), row 2, column 2 (flagged), row 3, column 2 (1), row 3, column 3 (1), row 2, column 4 (1), row 1, column 4 (unrevealed), and row 0, column 3 (empty).\n\nSo, '3' is adjacent to two flagged spaces, but it's already satisfied because row 1, column 3 is a '3' which is adjacent to three flagged spaces.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled here. Maybe I should look at row 4, column 0, which is a revealed bomb '*'. Adjacent to it are row 3, column 0 (_), row 3, column 1 (_), row 4, column 1 (_), row 5, column 0 (_), row 5, column 1 (_), row 4, column 2 (_), row 3, column 2 (1), and row 5, column 2 (_).\n\nSo, row 3, column 2 is a '1', which should have one bomb adjacent. It's adjacent to row 2, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 3 (flagged), row 4, column 2 (unrevealed), row 3, column 1 (unrevealed), row 4, column 3 (unrevealed), and the revealed bomb at row 4, column 0. So, it's adjacent to one revealed bomb and two flagged spaces. That would make it adjacent to three bombs, but it's a '1', which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, this suggests that the flags at row 2, column 2 and row 2, column 3 are incorrect, because row 3, column 2 is only supposed to have one adjacent bomb, but it's adjacent to three.\n\nTherefore, I need to remove the flags from row 2, column 2 and row 2, column 3.\n\nBut before doing that, let me double-check.\n\nRow 3, column 2 is a '1', adjacent to:\n\n- row 2, column 2 (flagged)\n\n- row 2, column 3 (flagged)\n\n- row 4, column 2 (unrevealed)\n\n- row 3, column 1 (unrevealed)\n\n- row 4, column 3 (unrevealed)\n\n- row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb)\n\nSo, it's adjacent to one revealed bomb and two flagged spaces. If both flags are actual bombs, that would make three bombs adjacent to row 3, column 2, but it's a '1', which indicates only one bomb adjacent. Therefore, the flags at row 2, column 2 and row 2, column 3 cannot both be correct.\n\nTherefore, at least one of them is not a bomb.\n\nBut row 1, column 3 is a '3', adjacent to row 1, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 3 (flagged), and others. If row 2, column 3 is not a bomb, then row 1, column 3 would only have two adjacent bombs, which doesn't satisfy its '3'.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that row 2, column 3 is not a bomb, and row 2, column 2 is a bomb.\n\nWait, let's think carefully.\n\nIf row 2, column 3 is not a bomb, then row 1, column 3's three adjacent bombs would be row 1, column 2, row 2, column 2, and row 4, column 0.\n\nBut row 4, column 0 is already a revealed bomb, and row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 2 are flagged.\n\nSo, if row 2, column 3 is not a bomb, then row 1, column 3 would have three adjacent bombs: row 1, column 2, row 2, column 2, and row 4, column 0.\n\nBut row 3, column 2 is a '1', adjacent to row 2, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 3 (not a bomb), row 4, column 2 (unrevealed), row 3, column 1 (unrevealed), row 4, column 3 (unrevealed), and row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb).\n\nSo, row 3, column 2 would be adjacent to two bombs: row 2, column 2 and row 4, column 0, which contradicts its value of '1'.\n\nTherefore, my assumption that row 2, column 3 is not a bomb is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, row 2, column 3 must be a bomb.\n\nBut then, row 3, column 2 being a '1' would be adjacent to row 2, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 3 (bomb), row 4, column 0 (bomb), which would make it adjacent to two bombs, contradicting its value of '1'.\n\nTherefore, there's an inconsistency here.\n\nPerhaps the flag at row 2, column 2 is incorrect.\n\nLet's try assuming that row 2, column 2 is not a bomb.\n\nThen, row 1, column 3's three adjacent bombs would be row 1, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 3 (flagged), and row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb).\n\nBut row 3, column 2's '1' would be adjacent to row 2, column 2 (not a bomb), row 2, column 3 (flagged), and row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb), which would make it adjacent to two bombs, again contradicting its value of '1'.\n\nThis suggests that no matter what, there's an inconsistency, meaning that the flags are incorrectly placed.\n\nPerhaps I need to remove one or both flags to resolve this.\n\nLet me consider removing the flag from row 2, column 3.\n\nIf I remove the flag from row 2, column 3, then row 1, column 3's count would be missing one bomb.\n\nSo, row 1, column 3 is a '3', adjacent to row 1, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 2 (flagged), and row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb), which is only three adjacent bombs if row 2, column 3 is not a bomb.\n\nBut then row 3, column 2's '1' would be adjacent to row 2, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 3 (not a bomb), and row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb), which is two bombs, contradicting its '1'.\n\nTherefore, this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if I remove the flag from row 2, column 2, then row 1, column 3 would only have two adjacent bombs: row 1, column 2 (flagged) and row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb), which doesn't satisfy its '3'.\n\nAnd row 3, column 2's '1' would be adjacent to row 2, column 2 (not a bomb), row 2, column 3 (flagged), and row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb), which is two bombs, again contradicting its '1'.\n\nThis suggests that the current flag placements are incorrect.\n\nPerhaps both flags are incorrectly placed.\n\nLet me consider that row 2, column 2 and row 2, column 3 are not bombs.\n\nThen, row 1, column 3's '3' would only be adjacent to row 1, column 2 (flagged) and row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb), which is only two bombs, not three.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only one of them is a bomb.\n\nSuppose row 2, column 2 is a bomb, and row 2, column 3 is not a bomb.\n\nThen, row 1, column 3's '3' would be adjacent to row 1, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 2 (bomb), and row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb), which is three bombs.\n\nRow 3, column 2's '1' would be adjacent to row 2, column 2 (bomb) and row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb), which is two bombs, contradicting its '1'.\n\nTherefore, this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, suppose row 2, column 3 is a bomb, and row 2, column 2 is not a bomb.\n\nThen, row 1, column 3's '3' would be adjacent to row 1, column 2 (flagged), row 2, column 3 (bomb), and row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb), which is three bombs.\n\nRow 3, column 2's '1' would be adjacent to row 2, column 3 (bomb) and row 4, column 0 (revealed bomb), which is two bombs, again contradicting its '1'.\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\nIt seems like no matter what, there's an inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps there's an error in the board or in my reasoning.\n\nLet me look elsewhere on the board to see if I can find a safer move.\n\nLooking at the bottom part of the board:\n\nRow 5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\nRow 6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nRow 7: 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\nRow 8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nIn row 5, there are five '1's in columns 5 through 9.\n\nRow 6 has '1's in columns 0,1,2,5,7, and an unexplored space in column 6 and column 8.\n\nRow 7 has '1's in columns 0,2,5,6,7, and unexplored spaces in column 1 and column 8.\n\nRow 8 has '3's in columns 0 and 1, '2' in column 2, and the rest are unexplored.\n\nRow 9 has two unexplored spaces in columns 0 and 1, and a '1' in column 2, with the rest unexplored.\n\nThis seems like a simpler area to analyze.\n\nLet's focus on row 5.\n\nRow 5: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n\nRow 6: 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n\nRow 7: 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n\nRow 8: 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nLooking at row 5, columns 5 through 9 are all '1's.\n\nEach '1' indicates exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\nLooking at row 6, columns 5 and 7 are '1's, and column 6 is a dot (unexplored).\n\nSimilarly, row 7, column 5 is a '1', column 6 is a dot, column 7 is a '1', and column 8 is a dot.\n\nRow 8, column 2 is a '2', which is adjacent to row 7, column 2 (which is a dot), row 7, column 3 (unrevealed), row 9, column 2 (which is a '1'), and other unexplored spaces.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look at row 9.\n\nRow 9 has two unexplored spaces in columns 0 and 1, and a '1' in column 2.\n\nRow 8 has '3's in columns 0 and 1, and a '2' in column 2.\n\nLet's consider row 8, column 0, which is a '3'.\n\nIt's adjacent to row 7, column 0 (which is a '1'), row 7, column 1 (dot), row 7, column 2 (dot), row 9, column 0 (dot), row 9, column 1 (dot), row 9, column 2 (1), row 8, column 1 (3), and row 8, column 2 (2).\n\nWait, but row 7, column 0 is a '1', which is adjacent to one bomb.\n\nSimilarly, row 8, column 0 is a '3', adjacent to three bombs.\n\nSimilarly, row 8, column 1 is a '3', adjacent to three bombs.\n\nRow 8, column 2 is a '2', adjacent to two bombs.\n\nRow 9, column 2 is a '1', adjacent to one bomb.\n\nThis seems like a complex area with multiple interconnected clues.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a place where I can safely place a flag or reveal a space without risking a bomb.\n\nLooking back at the top part of the board, perhaps I should consider row 4, column 9, which is a '1'.\n\nRow 4: * _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nIt's adjacent to row 3, column 9 (1), row 5, column 9 (1), row 5, column 8 (1), row 5, column 10 is out of bounds, etc.\n\nWait, row 4, column 9 is a '1', adjacent to row 3, column 9 (1), row 5, column 9 (1), and row 4, columns 8 and 10 (unrevealed).\n\nBut this seems like a less promising area compared to the bottom.\n\nLet me try to look for a spot where the number of possible bomb locations is limited.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 6, which is a dot, adjacent to row 5, column 6 (1), row 5, column 7 (1), row 6, column 5 (1), row 6, column 7 (1), and row 7, column 6 (dot).\n\nSimilarly, row 6, column 8 is a dot, adjacent to row 5, column 8 (1), row 5, column 9 (1), row 6, column 7 (1), row 7, column 8 (dot), and row 7, column 9 (dot).\n\nThese seem like potentially safe spots, but I need to ensure that there are no bombs there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the cluster around row 8, column 0.\n\nRow 8, column 0 is a '3', adjacent to row 7, column 0 (1), row 7, column 1 (dot), row 7, column 2 (dot), row 9, column 0 (dot), row 9, column 1 (dot), row 9, column 2 (1), row 8, column 1 (3), and row 8, column 2 (2).\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps I should try to place a flag in one of the unexplored spaces adjacent to these numbers.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to place a flag where it wouldn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reveal a space that seems safe based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 8, which is a dot, adjacent to row 6, column 8 (dot), row 6, column 7 (1), row 7, column 7 (1), row 7, column 9 (dot), row 8, column 8 (dot), and row 8, column 7 (dot).\n\nThis seems like a less risky area, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the area around row 4, column 9.\n\nRow 4, column 9 is a '1', adjacent to row 3, column 9 (1), row 5, column 9 (1), and row 4, columns 8 and 10 (unrevealed).\n\nRow 3, column 9 is a '1', adjacent to row 2, column 9 (dot), row 2, column 8 (dot), row 3, column 8 (dot), row 4, column 9 (1), and row 3, columns 7 and 10 (unrevealed).\n\nThis seems like a chain of '1's, which might indicate that bombs are placed in a specific pattern to satisfy all the '1's.\n\nPerhaps I can try to place a flag in row 4, column 8, assuming it's a bomb.\n\nBut before doing that, let's see what numbers are adjacent.\n\nRow 4, column 9 is a '1', adjacent to row 3, column 9 (1), row 5, column 9 (1), and row 4, column 8 (unrevealed) and row 4, column 10 (out of bounds).\n\nSo, if I place a flag in row 4, column 8, that would satisfy row 4, column 9's '1'.\n\nThen, row 3, column 9's '1' would be adjacent to row 2, column 9 (dot), row 2, column 8 (dot), row 3, column 8 (dot), row 4, column 9 (1), and row 4, column 8 (flagged).\n\nSo, row 3, column 9's '1' would be satisfied by the flagged space in row 4, column 8.\n\nSimilarly, row 5, column 9 is a '1', adjacent to row 4, column 9 (1), row 6, column 9 (dot), row 5, column 8 (1), and row 5, column 10 (out of bounds).\n\nIf row 4, column 8 is a bomb (flagged), that would satisfy row 5, column 9's '1'.\n\nWait, but row 5, column 9 is adjacent to row 4, column 9 (1), row 6, column 9 (dot), row 5, column 8 (1), and row 5, column 10 (out of bounds).\n\nSo, if row 4, column 8 is a bomb, that would satisfy row 5, column 9's '1'.\n\nSimilarly, row 5, column 8 is a '1', adjacent to row 4, column 8 (flagged), row 4, column 9 (1), row 5, column 7 (1), row 5, column 9 (1), and row 6, column 8 (dot).\n\nSo, row 5, column 8's '1' would be satisfied by the flagged space in row 4, column 8.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nSimilarly, row 6, column 9 is a dot, adjacent to row 5, column 9 (1), row 5, column 8 (1), row 6, column 8 (dot), row 7, column 9 (dot), and row 7, column 8 (dot).\n\nIf row 4, column 8 is a bomb, and row 5, column 9's '1' is satisfied, then row 6, column 9 should be safe to reveal.\n\nTherefore, I can consider revealing row 6, column 9.\n\nBut before doing that, let me check if there are any other implications.\n\nRow 7, column 9 is a dot, adjacent to row 6, column 9 (dot), row 6, column 8 (dot), row 7, column 8 (dot), row 8, column 9 (dot), and row 8, column 8 (dot).\n\nThis seems safe, but perhaps revealing row 6, column 9 is a better choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place a flag in row 4, column 8.\n\nBut I need to confirm that it's safe to do so.\n\nGiven that placing a flag there seems to satisfy the '1's in row 4, column 9; row 5, column 9; and row 5, column 8, and there are no contradictions, I think it's safe to place a flag there.\n\nMoreover, I have 7 flags left to place, and assuming that row 1, column 2; row 2, column 2; row 2, column 3; and row 4, column 0 are the only flags placed so far, that's four flags, and flags remaining is 7, which matches the game info.\n\nTherefore, placing a flag in row 4, column 8 would be the fifth flag placed.\n\nBut before doing that, let me double-check.\n\nIf I place a flag in row 4, column 8, then:\n\n- row 4, column 9's '1' is satisfied\n\n- row 5, column 8's '1' is satisfied\n\n- row 5, column 9's '1' is satisfied\n\n- row 3, column 9's '1' is satisfied by the flagged space in row 4, column 8\n\nEverything seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I can proceed to place a flag in row 4, column 8.\n\nAfter placing that flag, I can then consider revealing a safe space, such as row 6, column 9.\n\nBut since the task is to provide only the next move, I'll choose to place a flag in row 4, column 8.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed in this Minesweeper game, the next move should be to place a flag at position (4,8). This decision is based on analyzing the numbers and existing flags to deduce the likely location of a bomb.\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. **Identify Problem Area**: The initial analysis revealed inconsistencies in the flag placements around rows 1 and 2, suggesting potential errors in the current flags.\n   \n2. **Shift Focus**: To avoid confusion, shifted focus to the bottom part of the board, specifically rows 5 through 9, where the numbers and unexplored spaces offered a clearer path for logical deduction.\n\n3. **Analyze Bottom Section**: Focused on rows 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, noting the pattern of '1's and unexplored spaces.\n\n4. **Deduce Safe Flag Placement**: By considering the '1's in rows 4 and 5, particularly at positions (4,9) and (5,9), it was deduced that placing a flag at (4,8) would satisfy the conditions of these '1's without causing any contradictions.\n\n5. **Consistency Check**: Ensured that placing a flag at (4,8) aligns with the values of adjacent numbers, making it a logical choice for flag placement.\n\n**Next Move**\n\n- **Action**: Place a flag at position (4,8).\n\n- **Reasoning**: This move helps in correctly identifying a bomb location based on the analysis of adjacent number clues, thereby progressing safely in the game.\n\n**Final Solution Code**\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: Place a flag at position (4,8) to mark a bomb, based on the analysis of adjacent number clues.\nMOVE: 4,8,true\n```", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 2 1 2 . . . .\n1 _ 2 F 3 . 2 . . . .\n2 _ 2 F 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n4 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n7 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}

So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 6 flags left to place, which means 4 flags have already been placed. Looking at the board, I can see some flagged spaces and some revealed numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the flags that are already placed are correct. I should check each numbered cell to see if the number of adjacent flags matches the number on the cell.\n\nLet's start from the top-left corner.\n\nRow 0:\n\n- (0,0): _ (empty revealed space)\n\n- (0,1): 1\n\n- (0,2): 1\n\n- (0,3): 2\n\n- (0,4): 1\n\n- (0,5): 2\n\n- (0,6): .\n\n- (0,7): .\n\n- (0,8): .\n\n- (0,9): .\n\nRow 1:\n\n- (1,0): _ (empty revealed space)\n\n- (1,1): 2\n\n- (1,2): F (flagged space)\n\n- (1,3): 3\n\n- (1,4): .

That's four flags, and there are six flags left to place, meaning there are supposed to be ten flags in total, but the game says flags remaining: 6, and bombs: 10. So, it seems like four flags have been placed, and there are six more to place to account for the remaining bombs.\n\nFirst, I need to verify if the placed flags are correct.\n\nLooking at (1,2) and (2,2):\n\n- (1,2) is flagged, and (2,2) is flagged.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n- (1,1): 2, which should have two adjacent bombs.\n\nAdjacent to (1,1):\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nFrom these, (1,2) is flagged, and (2,2) is flagged. So, two flags adjacent to (1,1). So, that matches the '2'.\n\nNow, (2,3): 3\n\nAdjacent to (2,3):\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nAmong these, (1,2) and (2,2) are flagged. So, two flags adjacent to (2,3). But it's supposed to be three. So, there should be one more bomb adjacent to (2,3).\n\nLooking at (2,4): 1\n\nAdjacent to (2,4):\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n(2,3) is adjacent to (2,4), and (2,3) is adjacent to a flagged cell (1,2) and (2,2). Wait, no, (2,3) is adjacent to (1,2) and (2,2), both flagged.\n\nWait, no, (2,3) is adjacent to:\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nAnd (1,2) and (2,2) are flagged.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4): 1, adjacent to (2,3): 3, which is already confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a better approach.\n\nLet me try to look for areas where I can safely reveal tiles or place flags without doubt.\n\nLooking at row 5:\n\n- (5,5):1, (5,6):1, (5,7):1, (5,8):1, (5,9):1\n\nAll these are '1's, and they are in a line. Let's see their adjacencies.\n\n(5,5):1\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut it's a bit tricky without knowing the exact positions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8:\n\n- (8,0):3, (8,1):3, (8,2):2\n\nThese are higher numbers, suggesting more bombs around there.\n\nBut let's see.\n\n(8,0):3\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\nSimilarly, (8,1):3\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,0), (8,2), (8,3), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3)\n\nWait, but the board size is 10x10, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nBut in the board state provided, it seems row 9 has columns 0 to 9.\n\nWait, but in the coordinate system, x is row number (0 to 9), y is column number (0 to 9).\n\nLooking back at row 8:\n\n- (8,0):3, (8,1):3, (8,2):2\n\nLooking at their adjacencies.\n\nBut perhaps it's too early to make a move there.\n\nLet me look for a safer area.\n\nLooking at row 3:\n\n- (3,0):_, (3,1):1, (3,2):1, (3,3):1, (3,4):_, (3,5):_, (3,6):_, (3,7):_, (3,8):1, (3,9):.\n\n(3,1):1\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nAmong these, (2,2) is flagged, which is adjacent to (3,1). So, the '1' is already satisfied with one flag adjacent to it. Therefore, none of the other adjacent tiles should be bombs.\n\nSo, (3,4):_ is adjacent to (3,1), so it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2):1\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n(2,2) is flagged, which is adjacent to (3,2). So, the '1' is satisfied. Therefore, none of the other adjacent tiles should be bombs.\n\nSo, (3,5):_ is adjacent to (3,2), so it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3):1\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\n(2,2) is flagged, which is adjacent to (3,3). So, the '1' is satisfied. Therefore, none of the other adjacent tiles should be bombs.\n\nSo, (3,6):_ is adjacent to (3,3), so it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (3,8):1\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9)\n\nNone of these adjacent tiles are flagged yet. So, one of these should be a bomb.\n\nBut I need to be careful here.\n\nWait, let's see if any of these adjacent tiles are already revealed or flagged.\n\n(2,7):2, (2,8):1, (2,9):., (3,7):_, (3,9):., (4,7):_, (4,8):F, (4,9):.\n\nSo, (4,8) is flagged, which is adjacent to (3,8):1. So, the '1' is satisfied with one flag adjacent to it. Therefore, none of the other adjacent tiles should be bombs.\n\nSo, (3,7):_ and (3,9):. should be safe to reveal.\n\nWait, but (4,8) is flagged, which is adjacent to (3,8):1. So, the '1' is satisfied, meaning no other adjacent tiles are bombs.\n\nTherefore, (3,7):_ and (3,9):. are safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4):_, (3,5):_, (3,6):_ should also be safe.\n\nSo, perhaps I can reveal (3,7).\n\nBut let's see if there's a better move.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5:\n\n- (5,5):1, (5,6):1, (5,7):1, (5,8):1, (5,9):1\n\nThis seems like a row with multiple '1's in a line. Maybe I can find a pattern here.\n\nEach '1' indicates exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\nLooking at their adjacencies:\n\n(5,5): adjacent to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to deduce exactly where the bombs are.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6:\n\n- (6,0):1, (6,1):1, (6,2):1, (6,5):1, (6,7):1\n\nAgain, multiple '1's.\n\nLooking at (6,0):1\n\nAdjacent: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\n(5,1):_, (5,2):_, (6,1):1, (6,2):1, (7,0):1, (7,1):., (7,2):1\n\nNo flags adjacent, so one of these adjacent tiles is a bomb.\n\nBut it's not clear which one.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5):1\n\nAdjacent: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n(5,5):1, (5,6):1, (6,4):_, (6,6):., (7,4):_, (7,5):1, (7,6):1\n\nNo flags adjacent, so one of these is a bomb.\n\nAgain, not clear.\n\nPerhaps I should look back at row 3.\n\nI think revealing (3,7) is safe, as per earlier reasoning.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\n(3,8):1, with (4,8):F (flagged), so '1' is satisfied. Therefore, no other adjacent bombs, meaning (3,7):_ and (3,9):. are safe.\n\nSo, I can reveal (3,7).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reveal (3,9).\n\nBut (3,9) is adjacent to (4,9):., which is unexplored, and (4,8):F.\n\nSo, revealing (3,9) might be safe, but perhaps (3,7) is a better choice since it's already adjacent to some revealed tiles.\n\nWait, (3,7):_\n\nAdjacent to:\n\n- (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\n(2,7):2, (2,8):1, (3,6):_, (3,8):1, (4,7):_, (4,8):F\n\nFrom these, (4,8):F is a flag, which is adjacent to (3,8):1, which is satisfied, so no other adjacent bombs. Therefore, (3,7):_ should be safe.\n\nSo, I think revealing (3,7) is a safe move.\n\nBut before making that move, let's see if there are any other areas where I can place flags confidently.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n(1,1):2, with (1,2):F and (2,2):F, which satisfy the '2'.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3):3, with (1,2):F and (2,2):F, so needs one more flag adjacent to it.\n\nAdjacent to (2,3):\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nAlready has (1,2):F and (2,2):F, so one more flag needed among (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (1,3):., (1,4):., (2,4):1, (3,2):1, (3,3):1, (3,4):_\n\n(2,4):1, which should have exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\nAdjacent to (2,4):\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nAmong these, (2,3) is adjacent to (2,4), and (2,3) is adjacent to (1,2):F and (2,2):F, which are two flags, but (2,3):3 requires three flags, so there should be one more flag adjacent to (2,3).\n\nLooking again, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that since (2,3):3 needs one more flag, and (2,4):1 already has one flag adjacent (from (2,3)), so it might be safe to reveal some tiles around (2,4).\n\nBut this is getting too complicated for now.\n\nGiven that, I think the safest move is to reveal (3,7), as per earlier reasoning.\n\nSo, I'll go ahead with that.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed in this Minesweeper game, we need to make a move that is safe and doesn't risk hitting a bomb. Based on the current board state and the rules of Minesweeper, the best move is to reveal the tile at position (3,7).\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze Revealed Numbers and Flags:**\n   - Check all revealed numbers to ensure the adjacent flags match the number indicated.\n   - Identify any discrepancies or areas where additional flags are required.\n\n2. **Look for Safe Tiles:**\n   - Find tiles that are adjacent to numbered cells where the required number of flags has already been placed.\n   - These tiles can be safely revealed as they are unlikely to be bombs.\n\n3. **Prioritize Areas with Low Risk:**\n   - Focus on areas with lower numbers and fewer unknowns to minimize the risk of hitting a bomb.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a Minesweeper game, the \"code\" is the move we decide to make based on the board analysis.\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: The tile at (3,7) is safe to reveal because it is adjacent to a '1' that already has its required flag placed.\nMOVE: 3,7,false\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Step 1:** Analyze the board and ensure that existing flags correspond correctly to the revealed numbers.\n- **Step 2:** Identify that the '1' at (3,8) has its required flag adjacent (at (4,8)), meaning no other adjacent tiles are bombs.\n- **Step 3:** Conclude that (3,7) is a safe tile to reveal as it is adjacent to (3,8) and no additional bombs are present in that area.\n- **Final Move:** Reveal the tile at position (3,7) to progress safely in the game.", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 1 2 1 2 . . . .\n1 _ 2 F 3 . 2 . . . .\n2 _ 2 F 3 1 2 1 2 1 .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 .\n4 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ F .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n7 1 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 3 3 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}

So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 6 flags left to place, which means 4 flags have already been placed. Looking at the board, I can see some flagged spaces and some revealed numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the flags that are already placed are correct. I should check each numbered cell to see if the number of adjacent flags matches the number on the cell.\n\nLet's start from the top-left corner.\n\nRow 0:\n\n- (0,0): _ (empty revealed space)\n\n- (0,1): 1\n\n- (0,2): 1\n\n- (0,3): 2\n\n- (0,4): 1\n\n- (0,5): 2\n\n- (0,6): .\n\n- (0,7): .\n\n- (0,8): .\n\n- (0,9): .\n\nRow 1:\n\n- (1,0): _ (empty revealed space)\n\n- (1,1): 2\n\n- (1,2): F (flagged space)\n\n- (1,3): 3\n\n- (1,4): .

That's four flags, and there are six flags left to place, meaning there are supposed to be ten flags in total, but the game says flags remaining: 6, and bombs: 10. So, it seems like four flags have been placed, and there are six more to place to account for the remaining bombs.\n\nFirst, I need to verify if the placed flags are correct.\n\nLooking at (1,2) and (2,2):\n\n- (1,2) is flagged.\n\n- Adjacent to (1,2) are:\n\n- (0,1): 1\n\n- (0,2): 1\n\n- (0,3): 2\n\n- (1,1): 2\n\n- (1,3): 3\n\n- (2,1): 2\n\n- (2,3): 3\n\n- (2,2): F\n\n- (1,2) is flagged, so it should be a bomb.\n\n- Now, looking at (0,1): 1\n\n- Adjacent to (0,1):\n\n- (0,0): _\n\n- (0,2): 1\n\n- (1,0): _\n\n- (1,1): 2\n\n- (1,2): F\n\n- So, (0,1) shows 1, and it has one flag adjacent (at (1,2)), so that's consistent.\n\n- (0,2): 1\n\n- Adjacent:\n\n- (0,1): 1\n\n- (0,3): 2\n\n- (1,1): 2\n\n- (1,2): F\n\n- (1,3): 3\n\n- (2,1): 2\n\n- (2,2): F\n\n- (2,3): 3\n\n- (0,2) shows 1, and it has two flags adjacent (at (1,2) and (2,2)). That's a problem because it should only have one adjacent bomb. So, perhaps (2,2) is not a bomb?\n\nWait, but (2,2) is also flagged. If both (1,2) and (2,2) are bombs, then (0,2) shows 1, which would be inconsistent because it has two bombs adjacent. So, perhaps one of them is not a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of them is not a bomb. But if (1,2) is a bomb, and (2,2) is not, then (0,2) shows 1, which matches only (1,2). But then, (1,1): 2\n\n- Adjacent to (1,1):\n\n- (0,0): _\n\n- (0,1): 1\n\n- (0,2): 1\n\n- (1,2): F\n\n- (2,0): _\n\n- (2,1): 2\n\n- (2,2): F\n\n- (2,3): 3\n\n- (1,1) shows 2, and has two flags adjacent (at (1,2) and (2,2)). So, that matches.\n\nBut wait, if (2,2) is not a bomb, then (0,2) would have only one bomb adjacent (at (1,2)), which matches its value of 1. And (1,1) would have two flags adjacent, which matches its value of 2.\n\nBut if (2,2) is not a bomb, then what about (2,2)'s adjacent cells?\n\n(2,2): F (supposedly not a bomb)\n\n- Adjacent:\n\n- (1,1): 2\n\n- (1,2): F\n\n- (1,3): 3\n\n- (2,1): 2\n\n- (2,3): 3\n\n- (3,1): 1\n\n- (3,2): 1\n\n- (3,3): 1\n\nIf (2,2) is not a bomb, then (2,1): 2\n\n- Adjacent to (2,1):\n\n- (1,0): _\n\n- (1,1): 2\n\n- (1,2): F\n\n- (2,2): F\n\n- (2,3): 3\n\n- (3,0): _\n\n- (3,1): 1\n\n- (3,2): 1\n\n- (2,1) shows 2, and has one flag adjacent (at (1,2)), so if (2,2) is not a bomb, then it needs another bomb adjacent.\n\nPossible bomb locations adjacent to (2,1):\n\n- (1,0): _\n\n- (3,0): _\n\n- (3,1): 1\n\nIf (3,1): 1\n\n- Adjacent:\n\n- (2,0): _\n\n- (2,1): 2\n\n- (2,2): F\n\n- (3,2): 1\n\n- (3,3): 1\n\n- (4,0): F\n\n- (4,1): _\n\n- (4,2): _\n\n- (3,1) shows 1, and adjacent flags are at (4,0), so it needs another bomb adjacent if (2,2) is not a bomb.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that (2,2) is actually a bomb, and the inconsistency is due to a mistake in flagging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (0,2) is misflagged.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that (0,2) is supposed to have only one bomb adjacent, but currently, there are two flags adjacent (at (1,2) and (2,2)). So, perhaps one of them is not a bomb.\n\nBut then, (1,1) shows 2, and has two flags adjacent, which matches. So, if (2,2) is not a bomb, then (1,1) would only have one bomb adjacent, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, no. If (2,2) is not a bomb, then (1,1) has only one bomb adjacent (at (1,2)), but it shows 2. That's inconsistent.\n\nSo, perhaps (2,2) is a bomb after all.\n\nBut then, (0,2) has two bombs adjacent, but shows 1, which is inconsistent.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps (1,2) is not a bomb.\n\nWait, let's try to think differently.\n\nSuppose that (1,2) is a bomb, and (2,2) is not a bomb.\n\nThen:\n\n- (1,1): 2, with flags at (1,2) and (2,2). But if (2,2) is not a bomb, then (1,1) only has one bomb adjacent, which doesn't match its value of 2.\n\nSo, (2,2) must be a bomb.\n\nBut then, (0,2) has two bombs adjacent, which doesn't match its value of 1.\n\nTherefore, there's an inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps one of the flags is incorrectly placed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret this.\n\nWait, maybe (1,2) is not a bomb, and (2,2) is a bomb.\n\nThen:\n\n- (0,2) has one bomb adjacent (at (2,2)), which matches its value of 1.\n\n- (1,1) has one bomb adjacent (at (2,2)), but it shows 2, so it needs another bomb adjacent.\n\nPossible locations for the second bomb adjacent to (1,1):\n\n- (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)\n\nBut (2,1) is adjacent to (1,1):\n\n- (2,1): 2, which currently has one flag adjacent (at (1,2)). If (1,2) is not a bomb, then (2,1) needs two bombs adjacent.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should look at another part of the board.\n\nLet's look at the bottom part.\n\nRow 4:\n\n- (4,0): F\n\n- (4,1): _\n\n- (4,2): _\n\n- (4,3): _\n\n- (4,4): _\n\n- (4,5): _\n\n- (4,6): _\n\n- (4,7): _\n\n- (4,8): F\n\n- (4,9): .\n\nRow 5:\n\n- (5,0): _\n\n- (5,1): _\n\n- (5,2): _\n\n- (5,3): _\n\n- (5,4): _\n\n- (5,5): 1\n\n- (5,6): 1\n\n- (5,7): 1\n\n- (5,8): 1\n\n- (5,9): 1\n\nRow 6:\n\n- (6,0): 1\n\n- (6,1): 1\n\n- (6,2): 1\n\n- (6,3): _\n\n- (6,4): _\n\n- (6,5): 1\n\n- (6,6): .\n\n- (6,7): 1\n\n- (6,8): _\n\n- (6,9): _\n\nRow 7:\n\n- (7,0): 1\n\n- (7,1): .\n\n- (7,2): 1\n\n- (7,3): _\n\n- (7,4): _\n\n- (7,5): 1\n\n- (7,6): 1\n\n- (7,7): 1\n\n- (7,8): _\n\n- (7,9): _\n\nRow 8:\n\n- (8,0): 3\n\n- (8,1): 3\n\n- (8,2): 2\n\n- (8,3): _\n\n- (8,4): _\n\n- (8,5): _\n\n- (8,6): _\n\n- (8,7): _\n\n- (8,8): _\n\n- (8,9): _\n\nRow 9:\n\n- (9,0): .\n\n- (9,1): .\n\n- (9,2): 1\n\n- (9,3): _\n\n- (9,4): _\n\n- (9,5): _\n\n- (9,6): _\n\n- (9,7): _\n\n- (9,8): _\n\n- (9,9): _\n\nLooking at row 5:\n\n- (5,5): 1\n\n- (5,6): 1\n\n- (5,7): 1\n\n- (5,8): 1\n\n- (5,9): 1\n\nEach of these shows 1, meaning there is exactly one bomb in their adjacent cells.\n\nLet's consider (5,5): 1\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (4,4): _\n\n- (4,5): _\n\n- (4,6): _\n\n- (5,4): _\n\n- (5,6): 1\n\n- (6,4): _\n\n- (6,5): 1\n\n- (6,6): .\n\nFrom these, none are flagged, and some are unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6): 1\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (4,5): _\n\n- (4,6): _\n\n- (4,7): _\n\n- (5,5): 1\n\n- (5,7): 1\n\n- (6,5): 1\n\n- (6,6): .\n\n- (6,7): 1\n\nAgain, none are flagged, and some are unexplored.\n\nThis pattern continues for (5,7), (5,8), and (5,9).\n\nThis suggests that each of these '1's has exactly one bomb in their adjacent unexplored cells.\n\nNow, looking at (6,6): .\n\nThis is adjacent to (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nSimilarly, (7,1): . is adjacent to (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2).\n\nAnd (9,2): 1 is adjacent to (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3).\n\nThis seems a bit scattered.
