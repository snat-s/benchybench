Looking at the board, revealing a tile adjacent to a revealed number could help clarify the positions of bombs. For instance, revealing a tile next to a '1' could help identify where a bomb is located if the '1' already has an adjacent flag. However, since there are no immediately visible '1's with adjacent flags, we look for a tile that, when revealed, could give us the most information.

Looking at the board, revealing a tile adjacent to a revealed number could help clarify the positions of bombs.
