{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs, and I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after making this move, the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '3'. That means there are 3 bombs adjacent to this cell. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nSince it's my first move and I have no other information, I should flag the cells that are likely to be bombs based on this number. But I need to be careful not to overflag or underflag.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total, I need to use them wisely. Each flag I place should be as accurate as possible.\n\nLet's say I decide to flag three cells adjacent to the '3'. But which three? I need to look at the board and see if any of these adjacent cells are already revealed or have numbers that can give me more information.\n\nAssuming that no other cells are revealed yet, I can choose to flag any three of the eight adjacent cells. For now, I'll choose to flag (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5).\n\nSo, my next moves would be:\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\n\nMOVE: 3,4,true\n\nMOVE: 4,3,true\n\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged three cells, and I have 7 flags left. Next, I should reveal another cell that is not adjacent to the initial reveal to try to expand the board further.\n\nLet's choose (6,6) as another safe starting point.\n\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\n\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\nSuppose this reveals a '1'. Now, there is only one bomb adjacent to (6,6). The adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nI need to see if any of these are already flagged or revealed. Assuming none are flagged yet, I'll flag one of them, say (6,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\n\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged four cells, and I have 6 flags left.\n\nContinuing this process, I need to look for more numbers and adjust my flags accordingly. If I reveal a cell and it shows a '0', that means there are no bombs adjacent to it, and the game should automatically reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nLet's say I reveal (5,4) and it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nI already have flags on (4,3), (4,5), and (6,5). So, out of the eight adjacent cells to (5,4), three are flagged. The number '2' means only two of them are bombs. This suggests that one of the flagged cells is not a bomb, which is a conflict.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If '2' means exactly two adjacent bombs, and I have three flags on adjacent cells, then one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. Therefore, I need to remove one flag from the adjacent cells of (5,4).\n\nSo, I need to unflag one of the cells: (4,3), (4,5), or (6,5). But I need to choose wisely.\n\nLooking at the board, if I unflag (6,5), and assuming that (6,5) is not a bomb, then the '1' at (6,6) would still need one flag, so maybe (6,7) should be flagged.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (3,3). Suppose it shows a '1'. Adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nI have a flag on (3,4) and (4,3). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (3,3). But the '1' indicates only one adjacent bomb. Therefore, one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. So, I need to unflag one of them.\n\nThis suggests that either (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb. But earlier, based on the '3' at (4,4), I flagged (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5). Now, if one of (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb, then perhaps (4,5) is the actual bomb.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (5,5). Suppose it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nI have flags on (4,5) and (6,5). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (5,5). The '2' means exactly two bombs adjacent, so the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (4,6), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,6) safely.\n\nLet's reveal (4,6). Suppose it shows a '0'. Then, the game should auto-reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nNow, the board has expanded in that area, giving me more information.\n\nContinuing this process, revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers, I can progress through the game.\n\nIt's important to keep track of the number of flags left and the number of potential bombs still to be flagged.\n\nAlso, sometimes, I might need to make educated guesses when there isn't enough information to be certain, but that can be risky.\n\nIn summary, my strategy is to:\n\n1. Make initial safe moves to start revealing the board.\n\n2. Flag cells based on the numbers revealed, ensuring that the number of flags matches the numbers.\n\n3. Reveal cells that are likely safe based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\n4. Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n5. Continue this process until all bombs are flagged or all safe cells are revealed.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this Minesweeper problem, we need to methodically reveal safe cells and flag bombs based on the numbers revealed, which indicate how many bombs are adjacent to each cell. Here is a step-by-step approach to playing the game:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - The first move is safe, so choose a central cell to maximize the area revealed.\n   - Based on the number revealed, flag the appropriate number of adjacent cells as bombs.\n\n2. **Expand the Board**:\n   - Choose another safe cell away from the initial move to further expand the revealed area.\n   - Continue flagging cells based on the numbers revealed.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If a number indicates fewer bombs than the flags placed, remove flags accordingly.\n   - Ensure that the number of flags around each numbered cell matches the number shown.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n6. **Completion**:\n   - The game is won by either revealing all safe cells or correctly flagging all bombs.\n\n### Solution Code Structure\n\nSince Minesweeper is an interactive problem, the solution involves a series of moves based on the board's state, which is updated after each move. Therefore, the solution is presented as a sequence of moves with explanations.\n\n### Example Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\n# Move 1: Initial safe move at center\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '3'\n# Flag three adjacent cells\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\nMOVE: 3,4,true\nMOVE: 4,3,true\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\n# Move 2: Another safe move away from initial reveal\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '1'\n# Flag one adjacent cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\n# Move 3: Reveal a new cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another cell to get more information.\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '2'\n# Adjust flags based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Adjust flags around '2' at (5,4).\n# If conflict, unflag one cell\nMOVE: 4,5,false  # Unflag if necessary\n\n# Move 4: Reveal a safe cell based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a safe cell adjacent to '2'.\nMOVE: 4,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '0'\n# Auto-reveal neighbors\nEXPLANATION: '0' at (4,6), auto-revealing neighbors.\n\n# Continue this process until the game is solved.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - Start with a safe move at the center to maximize reveal.\n   - Flag adjacent cells based on the number revealed.\n\n2. **Expanding the Board**:\n   - Make another safe move away from the initial reveal to get more information.\n   - Flag cells accordingly based on new revelations.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If flags exceed the number indicated, remove flags from likely safe cells.\n   - Ensure consistency between flags and numbers.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust strategy as new information is revealed to avoid conflicts and progress towards solving the board.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. It's a 10x10 grid with 10 bombs left to find, and I have 10 flags remaining. I need to be careful not to step on any bombs while trying to clear the board or correctly flag all the bombs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. There are several revealed numbers and some unexplored spaces. My goal is to either reveal safe squares or place flags on squares that definitely contain bombs.\n\nLet me start by looking at the numbers and seeing what they tell me about the surrounding squares.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Column 7 has a '1'. That means there is exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n- Column 6 has a '1', column 7 has a '2'.\n\nSo, for row 1, column 7 being a '2' means there are two bombs in its eight surrounding squares.\n\nRow 2:\n\n- Column 6 has a '1'.\n\nRow 3:\n\n- Column 3 has a '1', column 4 has a '2', column 5 has a '2', column 6 has a '2', column 7 has a '1', column 8 has a '2'.\n\nRow 4:\n\n- Column 3 has a '1', column 4 has a '.', column 6 has a '.', column 7 has a '1', column 8 has a '1'.\n\nRow 5:\n\n- Column 3 has a '1', column 4 has a '2', column 5 has a '2', column 6 has a '1', column 8 has a '1'.\n\nRow 6:\n\n- Column 9 has a '2'.\n\nRow 7:\n\n- Column 0 has a '1', column 1 has a '1', column 9 has a '3'.\n\nRow 8:\n\n- Column 1 has a '1', column 5 has a '1', column 6 has a '1', column 7 has a '1', column 8 has a '2'.\n\nRow 9:\n\n- Column 1 has a '1', column 5 has a '1'.\n\nI need to look for areas where I can deduce the exact positions of bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\nLet's start with row 7, column 0, which is a '1'. This '1' indicates that there is exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares. The surrounding squares are:\n\n- (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n\nLooking at these squares:\n\n- (6,0): unexplored\n\n- (6,1): unexplored\n\n- (6,2): unexplored\n\n- (7,1): revealed as '1'\n\n- (8,0): unexplored\n\n- (8,1): revealed as '1'\n\n- (8,2): unexplored\n\nWait, (7,1) is revealed as '1', and (8,1) is revealed as '1'. So, the surrounding squares of (7,0) are mostly unexplored, except for (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut, I need to see if there are any flags already placed around here that can help me determine where the bomb is.\n\nLooking at these positions, none of them seem to have flags yet. So, with the '1' at (7,0), and multiple unexplored squares around it, I can't pinpoint exactly where the bomb is yet. Maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at row 7, column 1, which is also a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)\n\n- (7,0), (7,2)\n\n- (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n\nAgain, many of these are unexplored, and no flags are placed yet. So, similar situation as above.\n\nPerhaps I should look at row 8, column 1, which is a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\n- (8,0), (8,2)\n\n- (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\nAgain, many unexplored squares, no flags placed yet.\n\nThis area seems too vague to make a confident move. Maybe I should look for areas with more information.\n\nLet's check row 3, column 7, which is a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\n- (3,6), (3,8)\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (2,6): unexplored\n\n- (2,7): unexplored\n\n- (2,8): unexplored\n\n- (3,6): unexplored\n\n- (3,8): unexplored\n\n- (4,6): unexplored\n\n- (4,7): unexplored\n\n- (4,8): unexplored\n\nAgain, nothing helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 5, column 6, which is a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\n- (5,5), (5,7)\n\n- (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (4,5): unexplored\n\n- (4,6): unexplored\n\n- (4,7): revealed as '1'\n\n- (5,5): unexplored\n\n- (5,7): unexplored\n\n- (6,5): unexplored\n\n- (6,6): unexplored\n\n- (6,7): unexplored\n\nStill too many unexplored squares without any flags.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for areas where the numbers are higher, indicating more bombs in the surrounding squares.\n\nLet's look at row 7, column 9, which is a '3'. This means there are three bombs in the eight surrounding squares. The surrounding squares are:\n\n- (6,8), (6,9)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (8,8), (8,9)\n\n- (9,8), (9,9)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (6,8): unexplored\n\n- (6,9): unexplored\n\n- (7,8): unexplored\n\n- (8,8): revealed as '2'\n\n- (8,9): unexplored\n\n- (9,8): unexplored\n\n- (9,9): unexplored\n\nWait, (8,8) is revealed as '2', which means there are two bombs in its eight surrounding squares. The surrounding squares of (8,8) are:\n\n- (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n\n- (8,7), (8,9)\n\n- (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nBut (7,7) is unexplored, (7,8) is unexplored, (7,9) is unexplored, (8,7) is unexplored, (8,9) is unexplored, (9,7) is unexplored, (9,8) is unexplored, (9,9) is unexplored.\n\nSo, for (8,8) being a '2', and all surroundings unexplored, and (7,9) being a '3', which is also surrounded by unexplored squares, this area seems too vague as well.\n\nMaybe I need to look for areas where I can eliminate possibilities based on multiple numbers interacting.\n\nLet's consider row 3, where there are several numbers: column 3 has a '1', column 4 has a '2', column 5 has a '2', column 6 has a '2', column 7 has a '1', column 8 has a '2'.\n\nThis seems like a complex area with multiple interacting numbers. Maybe I can make some deductions here.\n\nLet's map out the surroundings for these numbers and see if I can find any overlaps or contradictions.\n\nStarting with row 3, column 3 ('1'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n- (3,2), (3,4)\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nNow, row 3, column 4 ('2'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\n- (3,3), (3,5)\n\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nRow 3, column 5 ('2'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n- (3,4), (3,6)\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nRow 3, column 6 ('2'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n\n- (3,5), (3,7)\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\nRow 3, column 7 ('1'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\n- (3,6), (3,8)\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\nRow 3, column 8 ('2'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n\n- (3,7), (3,9)\n\n- (4,7), (4,8), (4,9)\n\nThis is a lot of overlapping areas. Maybe I can look for squares that are covered by multiple numbers and see if I can deduce anything.\n\nFor example, square (2,5) is surrounded by row 3, column 4 ('2') and row 3, column 5 ('2'). Similarly, square (2,6) is surrounded by row 3, column 5 ('2') and row 3, column 6 ('2').\n\nLet me try to see if I can find any squares that must contain a bomb or must be safe based on these numbers.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 4, which is a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n- (4,3), (4,5)\n\n- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nNow, row 4, column 3 is a '1', and row 4, column 5 is a '2'.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can consider the possibilities for bomb placements in this area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for squares that are only covered by one number, making it easier to determine if they are safe or contain a bomb.\n\nLooking back at the board, I see row 0, column 7 has a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (0,6): unexplored\n\n- (0,8): revealed as '1'\n\n- (1,6): unexplored\n\n- (1,7): revealed as '1'\n\n- (1,8): revealed as '2'\n\n- (2,6): unexplored\n\n- (2,7): unexplored\n\n- (2,8): unexplored\n\nSo, for row 0, column 7 being a '1', and considering the surrounding squares, some are revealed and some are unexplored.\n\nWait, (0,8) is revealed as '1', which means there is one bomb in its eight surrounding squares, which are:\n\n- (0,7), (0,9)\n\n- (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)\n\n- (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nNow, (0,7) is '1', (1,7) is '1', (1,8) is '2', (2,7) is unexplored, (2,8) is unexplored, (2,9) is unexplored, (1,9) is unexplored, (0,9) is unexplored.\n\nThis seems a bit tangled. Maybe I need to consider the possibilities for bomb placements in this small area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for squares that are safe to reveal because they cannot possibly contain a bomb based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 9, which is a '2'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (5,8), (5,9)\n\n- (6,8)\n\n- (7,8), (7,9)\n\n- (8,8), (8,9)\n\n- (9,8), (9,9)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (5,8): unexplored\n\n- (5,9): unexplored\n\n- (6,8): unexplored\n\n- (7,8): unexplored\n\n- (7,9): revealed as '3'\n\n- (8,8): revealed as '2'\n\n- (8,9): unexplored\n\n- (9,8): unexplored\n\n- (9,9): unexplored\n\nSo, for row 6, column 9 being a '2', and considering the surrounding squares, some are revealed with numbers, some are unexplored.\n\nWait, (7,9) is a '3', which means there are three bombs in its eight surrounding squares.\n\nThe surrounding squares of (7,9) are:\n\n- (6,8), (6,9)\n\n- (7,8), (7,10) \u2013 but column 10 doesn't exist, so only up to column 9\n\n- (8,8), (8,9)\n\n- (9,8), (9,9)\n\nSo, the actual surrounding squares are:\n\n- (6,8), (6,9)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (8,8), (8,9)\n\n- (9,8), (9,9)\n\nNow, (6,9) is unexplored, (6,8) is unexplored, (7,8) is unexplored, (8,8) is '2', (8,9) is unexplored, (9,8) is unexplored, (9,9) is unexplored.\n\nGiven that (7,9) is '3', and (8,8) is '2', I need to see if I can deduce any bomb placements here.\n\nBut it's still too vague. Maybe I need to consider the total number of bombs and flags left.\n\nI have 10 flags left, and there are 10 bombs left on the board. So, I need to make sure that I place flags only on squares that are definitely bombs, and reveal the rest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for areas where the number of unexplored squares matches the number of remaining bombs.\n\nBut in this board, with 10 bombs left and many unexplored squares, it's not immediately obvious.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability of certain squares containing bombs based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, in row 0, column 7 being a '1', and having several unexplored squares around it, perhaps I can calculate the probability of each unexplored square containing a bomb.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming, and I'd prefer to make a logical deduction rather than guessing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for squares that are safe to reveal because they are unlikely to be bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 7, which is unexplored, and surrounded by revealed numbers.\n\nWait, row 2, column 7 is unexplored, and it's surrounded by:\n\n- (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)\n\n- (2,6), (2,8)\n\n- (3,6), (3,7), (3,8)\n\nSome of these are revealed numbers, but it's still not clear.\n\nMaybe I need to look for a square that is covered by multiple numbers, where the numbers indicate that it must be safe or must contain a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a square that, if I assume it's a bomb, would conflict with the numbers around it.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should just pick a square that seems safe and reveal it, keeping in mind that I need to be cautious.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 6, which is unexplored, and it's adjacent to row 0, column 7, which is '1'.\n\nIf I reveal row 0, column 6, and it turns out to be a bomb, that would satisfy the '1' at row 0, column 7, since it only needs one adjacent bomb.\n\nBut I don't know if that's the case. Maybe there are multiple possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, if I place a flag on row 0, column 6, then the '1' at row 0, column 7 would be satisfied, but I need to make sure that there are no other bombs adjacent to other numbers.\n\nBut I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs, so I need to use them wisely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for areas where the number of unexplored squares matches the number of bombs needed according to the numbers.\n\nFor example, if I have a number '2' surrounded by two unexplored squares, then both must be bombs.\n\nBut in this board, I don't see any such clear-cut scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, if I have a number '1' with one unexplored square and one flagged square, then the remaining unexplored squares around it must be safe.\n\nBut again, in this board, it's not immediately apparent.\n\nMaybe I need to consider multiple numbers together to make deductions.\n\nLooking back at row 3, with multiple numbers, perhaps I can make some deductions there.\n\nLet's consider row 3, column 3, which is '1', and row 3, column 4, which is '2', and so on.\n\nBut it's still too complex for me to make a definitive move right now.\n\nPerhaps I should consider revealing a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, in hopes of getting more information.\n\nFor example, row 3, column 6 is '2', and it's surrounded by several unexplored squares.\n\nIf I reveal one of those unexplored squares, I might get more information about the surrounding area.\n\nBut there's a risk of hitting a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place a flag on a square that is likely to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, if I look at row 7, column 9, which is '3', and it's surrounded by several unexplored squares, perhaps one of those is a bomb.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to place a flag incorrectly.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at the '3' at row 7, column 9, and consider that it needs three bombs in its surrounding squares.\n\nIf I can identify which squares are likely to be bombs based on other numbers, I might be able to place flags accordingly.\n\nBut right now, with so many unexplored squares, it's difficult to be certain.\n\nPerhaps I should consider revealing a square that is less likely to be a bomb, based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, row 6, column 9 is '2', and it's surrounded by several unexplored squares.\n\nIf I reveal one of those unexplored squares, there's a chance it's not a bomb, especially if it's also adjacent to other numbers that suggest fewer bombs in the area.\n\nBut again, it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for squares that are only adjacent to one number, making it easier to determine their status.\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any such squares.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the total number of unexplored squares and the number of bombs left.\n\nBut with a 10x10 board, and many squares unexplored, it's hard to make an exact count.\n\nPerhaps I should just pick a square that seems safe and reveal it, accepting some level of risk.\n\nFor example, row 0, column 6 is unexplored, and it's adjacent to row 0, column 7, which is '1'.\n\nIf I reveal row 0, column 6, and it's a bomb, then the '1' at row 0, column 7 would be satisfied, but I'd lose the game.\n\nAlternatively, if it's safe, then I can gain more information.\n\nBut I don't want to take that risk.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place a flag on row 0, column 6, assuming it's a bomb, and see if that satisfies the '1' at row 0, column 7.\n\nBut then, I need to ensure that no other squares adjacent to other numbers have conflicting bomb placements.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for me to decide confidently.\n\nMaybe I should look for areas with fewer unexplored squares.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 6, which is unexplored, and adjacent to row 1, column 7, which is '1', and row 1, column 8, which is '2'.\n\nIf I reveal row 1, column 6, and it's a bomb, then it would satisfy the '1' at row 1, column 7, but I'd lose.\n\nAlternatively, if it's safe, I get more information.\n\nAgain, too risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place a flag there, assuming it's a bomb, but I need to make sure it doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to be sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider revealing a square that is less central, to minimize the risk.\n\nFor example, row 9, column 5, which is unexplored, and adjacent to row 9, column 1, which is '1', but that's quite a distance away.\n\nWait, row 9, column 5 is unexplored, and it's adjacent to row 8, column 5, which is unexplored, and row 9, column 4 and row 9, column 6, which are unexplored.\n\nBut there are no numbers nearby to give me information about it.\n\nSo, revealing that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for squares that are adjacent to numbers indicating zero bombs, but in this board, there are no '0's, so that's not possible.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps the safest move is to reveal a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, in hopes of getting more information, even though there's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place a flag on a square that is likely to be a bomb based on the numbers, but I need to be very careful not to place flags incorrectly.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs, each flag placement is critical.\n\nI think I need to make a move based on the available information, even if it's not completely certain.\n\nAfter considering all this, I think I'll choose to reveal row 0, column 6.\n\nEXPLANATION: After analyzing the board, I couldn't find a square that is definitively safe or a bomb based on the current numbers and flags. Therefore, I've decided to reveal row 0, column 6, accepting the risk that it might be a bomb, but hoping to gain more information about the surrounding area.\n\nMOVE: 0,6,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 2 2 2 1 2 .\n4 _ _ _ 1 . . 1 _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ 1 2 2 1 _ 1 .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 .\n7 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 3 .\n8 . 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 2 .\n9 . 1 _ _ _ 1 . . . .", "sucess": true}

It's a 10x10 grid with 10 bombs left to find, and I have 10 flags remaining. I need to be careful not to step on any bombs while trying to clear the board or correctly flag all the bombs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. There are several revealed numbers and some unexplored spaces. My goal is to either reveal safe squares or place flags on squares that definitely contain bombs.\n\nLet me start by looking at the numbers and seeing what they tell me about the surrounding squares.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Column 7 has a '1'. That means there is exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n- Column 6 has a '1', column 7 has a '2'.\n\nSo, for row 1, column 7 being a '2' means there are two bombs in its eight surrounding squares.\n\nRow 2:\n\n- Column 6 has a '1'.\n\nRow 3:\n\n- Column 3 has a '1', column 4 has a '2', column 5 has a '2', column 6 has a '2', column 7 has a '1', column 8 has a '2'.\n\nRow 4:\n\n- Column 3 has a '1', column 4 has a '.', column 6 has a '.', column 7 has a '1', column 8 has a '1'.\n\nRow 5:\n\n- Column 3 has a '1', column 4 has a '2', column 5 has a '2', column 6 has a '1', column 8 has a '1'.\n\nRow 6:\n\n- Column 9 has a '2'.\n\nRow 7:\n\n- Column 0 has a '1', column 1 has a '1', column 9 has a '3'.\n\nRow 8:\n\n- Column 1 has a '1', column 5 has a '1', column 6 has a '1', column 7 has a '1', column 8 has a '2'.\n\nRow 9:\n\n- Column 1 has a '1', column 5 has a '1'.\n\nI need to look for areas where I can deduce the exact positions of bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\nLet's start with row 7, column 0, which is a '1'. This '1' indicates that there is exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares. The surrounding squares are:\n\n- (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n\nLooking at these squares:\n\n- (6,0): unexplored\n\n- (6,1): unexplored\n\n- (6,2): unexplored\n\n- (7,1): revealed as '1'\n\n- (8,0): unexplored\n\n- (8,1): revealed as '1'\n\n- (8,2): unexplored\n\nWait, (7,1) is revealed as '1', and (8,1) is revealed as '1'. So, the surrounding squares of (7,0) are mostly unexplored, except for (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut, I need to see if there are any flags already placed around here that can help me determine where the bomb is.\n\nLooking at these positions, none of them seem to have flags yet. So, with the '1' at (7,0), and multiple unexplored squares around it, I can't pinpoint exactly where the bomb is yet. Maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at row 7, column 1, which is also a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)\n\n- (7,0), (7,2)\n\n- (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n\nAgain, many of these are unexplored, and no flags are placed yet. So, similar situation as above.\n\nPerhaps I should look at row 8, column 1, which is a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\n- (8,0), (8,2)\n\n- (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\nAgain, many unexplored squares, no flags placed yet.\n\nThis area seems too vague to make a confident move. Maybe I should look for areas with more information.\n\nLet's check row 3, column 7, which is a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\n- (3,6), (3,8)\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (2,6): unexplored\n\n- (2,7): unexplored\n\n- (2,8): unexplored\n\n- (3,6): unexplored\n\n- (3,8): unexplored\n\n- (4,6): unexplored\n\n- (4,7): unexplored\n\n- (4,8): unexplored\n\nAgain, nothing helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 5, column 6, which is a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\n- (5,5), (5,7)\n\n- (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (4,5): unexplored\n\n- (4,6): unexplored\n\n- (4,7): revealed as '1'\n\n- (5,5): unexplored\n\n- (5,7): unexplored\n\n- (6,5): unexplored\n\n- (6,6): unexplored\n\n- (6,7): unexplored\n\nStill too many unexplored squares without any flags.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for areas where the numbers are higher, indicating more bombs in the surrounding squares.\n\nLet's look at row 7, column 9, which is a '3'. This means there are three bombs in the eight surrounding squares. The surrounding squares are:\n\n- (6,8), (6,9)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (8,8), (8,9)\n\n- (9,8), (9,9)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (6,8): unexplored\n\n- (6,9): unexplored\n\n- (7,8): unexplored\n\n- (8,8): revealed as '2'\n\n- (8,9): unexplored\n\n- (9,8): unexplored\n\n- (9,9): unexplored\n\nWait, (8,8) is revealed as '2', which means there are two bombs in its eight surrounding squares. The surrounding squares of (8,8) are:\n\n- (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n\n- (8,7), (8,9)\n\n- (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nBut (7,7) is unexplored, (7,8) is unexplored, (7,9) is unexplored, (8,7) is unexplored, (8,9) is unexplored, (9,7) is unexplored, (9,8) is unexplored, (9,9) is unexplored.\n\nSo, for (8,8) being a '2', and all surroundings unexplored, and (7,9) being a '3', which is also surrounded by unexplored squares, this area seems too vague as well.\n\nMaybe I need to look for areas where I can eliminate possibilities based on multiple numbers interacting.\n\nLet's consider row 3, where there are several numbers: column 3 has a '1', column 4 has a '2', column 5 has a '2', column 6 has a '2', column 7 has a '1', column 8 has a '2'.\n\nThis seems like a complex area with multiple interacting numbers. Maybe I can make some deductions here.\n\nLet's map out the surroundings for these numbers and see if I can find any overlaps or contradictions.\n\nStarting with row 3, column 3 ('1'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n- (3,2), (3,4)\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nNow, row 3, column 4 ('2'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\n- (3,3), (3,5)\n\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nRow 3, column 5 ('2'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n- (3,4), (3,6)\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nRow 3, column 6 ('2'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n\n- (3,5), (3,7)\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\nRow 3, column 7 ('1'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\n- (3,6), (3,8)\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\nRow 3, column 8 ('2'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n\n- (3,7), (3,9)\n\n- (4,7), (4,8), (4,9)\n\nThis is a lot of overlapping areas. Maybe I can look for squares that are covered by multiple numbers and see if I can deduce anything.\n\nFor example, square (2,5) is surrounded by row 3, column 4 ('2') and row 3, column 5 ('2'). Similarly, square (2,6) is surrounded by row 3, column 5 ('2') and row 3, column 6 ('2').\n\nLet me try to see if I can find any squares that must contain a bomb or must be safe based on these numbers.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 4, which is a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n- (4,3), (4,5)\n\n- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nNow, row 4, column 3 is a '1', and row 4, column 5 is a '2'.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can consider the possibilities for bomb placements in this area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for squares that are only covered by one number, making it easier to determine if they are safe or contain a bomb.\n\nLooking back at the board, I see row 0, column 7 has a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (0,6): unexplored\n\n- (0,8): revealed as '1'\n\n- (1,6): unexplored\n\n- (1,7): revealed as '1'\n\n- (1,8): revealed as '2'\n\n- (2,6): unexplored\n\n- (2,7): unexplored\n\n- (2,8): unexplored\n\nSo, for row 0, column 7 being a '1', and considering the surrounding squares, some are revealed and some are unexplored.\n\nWait, (0,8) is revealed as '1', which means there is one bomb in its eight surrounding squares, which are:\n\n- (0,7), (0,9)\n\n- (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)\n\n- (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nNow, (0,7) is '1', (1,7) is '1', (1,8) is '2', (2,7) is unexplored, (2,8) is unexplored, (2,9) is unexplored, (1,9) is unexplored, (0,9) is unexplored.\n\nThis seems a bit tangled. Maybe I need to consider the possibilities for bomb placements in this small area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for squares that are safe to reveal because they cannot possibly contain a bomb based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 9, which is a '2'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (5,8), (5,9)\n\n- (6,8)\n\n- (7,8), (7,9)\n\n- (8,8), (8,9)\n\n- (9,8), (9,9)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (5,8): unexplored\n\n- (5,9): unexplored\n\n- (6,8): unexplored\n\n- (7,8): unexplored\n\n- (7,9): revealed as '3'\n\n- (8,8): revealed as '2'\n\n- (8,9): unexplored\n\n- (9,8): unexplored\n\n- (9,9): unexplored\n\nSo, for row 6, column 9 being a '2', and considering the surrounding squares, some are revealed with numbers, some are unexplored.\n\nWait, (7,9) is a '3', which means there are three bombs in its eight surrounding squares.\n\nThe surrounding squares of (7,9) are:\n\n- (6,8), (6,9)\n\n- (7,8), (7,10) \u2013 but column 10 doesn't exist, so only up to column 9\n\n- (8,8), (8,9)\n\n- (9,8), (9,9)\n\nSo, (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nNow, (6,8) is unexplored, (6,9) is unexplored, (7,8) is unexplored, (8,8) is '2', (8,9) is unexplored, (9,8) is unexplored, (9,9) is unexplored.\n\nGiven that (7,9) is '3', and (8,8) is '2', I need to see if I can deduce any bomb placements here.\n\nBut it's still too vague. Maybe I need to consider the total number of bombs and flags left.\n\nI have 10 flags left, and there are 10 bombs left on the board. So, I need to make sure that I place flags only on squares that are definitely bombs, and reveal the rest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for areas where the number of unexplored squares matches the number of remaining bombs.\n\nBut in this board, with 10 bombs left and many unexplored squares, it's not immediately obvious.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability of certain squares containing bombs based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, in row 7, column 9 being a '3', with several unexplored squares around it, the probability might be higher in those squares.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to just guess; I need to make logical deductions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for squares that are safe to reveal because they are unlikely to be bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLooking back at row 0, column 7 being a '1', and considering its surrounding squares, perhaps I can try to reveal one of the unexplored squares around it and see what happens.\n\nBut that might be risky if I don't have enough information.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for squares that are covered by multiple numbers, where the numbers suggest that a particular square must be a bomb or must be safe.\n\nFor example, if two adjacent numbers both indicate that a certain square must contain a bomb, then I can be confident to place a flag there.\n\nAlternatively, if a number has already accounted for its required bombs with existing flags, then the remaining surrounding squares must be safe.\n\nLooking back at the board, I don't see any such clear interactions yet.\n\nPerhaps I need to make a move based on the least risk.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 0, which is unexplored. It's adjacent to row 7, column 0, which is a '1'.\n\nIf I reveal row 6, column 0, and it's a bomb, that would satisfy the '1' for row 7, column 0.\n\nBut I don't know if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reveal a square that is less likely to be a bomb based on the numbers around it.\n\nBut honestly, with the current information, it's hard to be certain.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total number of unexplored squares and the number of bombs left.\n\nCounting the unexplored squares:\n\nRows 0 to 9, columns 0 to 9, total of 100 squares.\n\nSubtracting the revealed squares:\n\nRows 0 to 9:\n\n- Row 0: 2 revealed ('1', '.'), rest unexplored\n\n- Row 1: 3 revealed ('1', '2', '.'), rest unexplored\n\n- Row 2: 3 revealed ('1', '.', '.'), rest unexplored\n\n- Row 3: 5 revealed ('1', '2', '2', '2', '1', '2'), rest unexplored\n\n- Row 4: 5 revealed ('1', '.', '.', '1', '1'), rest unexplored\n\n- Row 5: 5 revealed ('1', '2', '2', '1', '1'), rest unexplored\n\n- Row 6: 2 revealed ('2', '.'), rest unexplored\n\n- Row 7: 4 revealed ('1', '1', '.', '3'), rest unexplored\n\n- Row 8: 5 revealed ('1', '1', '1', '2', '.'), rest unexplored\n\n- Row 9: 4 revealed ('1', '1', '.', '.', '.'), rest unexplored\n\nEstimating the number of revealed squares:\n\nRow 0: 2\n\nRow 1: 3\n\nRow 2: 3\n\nRow 3: 6\n\nRow 4: 5\n\nRow 5: 5\n\nRow 6: 2\n\nRow 7: 4\n\nRow 8: 5\n\nRow 9: 4\n\nTotal revealed squares: 2 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 41\n\nTotal squares: 100\n\nUnexplored squares: 100 - 41 = 59\n\nBombs left: 10\n\nSo, the probability of any unexplored square being a bomb is 10/59, which is roughly 16.95%.\n\nBut I need to make a more informed decision than just random choice.\n\nPerhaps I should look for areas where the number of unexplored squares matches the number of remaining bombs needed according to the numbers.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has only one unexplored square around it, then that square must contain a bomb.\n\nLooking back at the board, I don't see any such clear cases.\n\nAlternatively, if a '2' has two unexplored squares and no other bombs in its surroundings, then both must be bombs.\n\nAgain, no such clear cases.\n\nMaybe I need to look for squares that are covered by multiple numbers, where the sum of the numbers indicates the bomb placements.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for now. Perhaps I should make a move by revealing a square that seems relatively safe.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 0, which is unexplored, adjacent to row 1, column 0, which is unexplored, but row 1, column 1 is unexplored, and row 0, column 0 is unexplored.\n\nThis area seems isolated, and perhaps safer to reveal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reveal row 6, column 0.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to reveal row 0, column 0.\n\nIt's an unexplored square, and it's adjacent to row 0, column 7, which is a '1'.\n\nBut that seems too far away to be relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reveal row 6, column 0.\n\nBut again, it's too vague.\n\nMaybe I should just pick a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, hoping to get more information.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 0, which is a '1', and adjacent to row 6, column 0, which is unexplored.\n\nPerhaps I can reveal row 6, column 0.\n\nBut there's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place a flag on a square that seems likely to contain a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 9, which is a '3', and its surrounding squares are mostly unexplored.\n\nPerhaps one of those unexplored squares contains a bomb.\n\nBut I don't want to just guess.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the following:\n\n- Row 7, column 9 is a '3', meaning three bombs in its surroundings.\n\n- Row 8, column 8 is a '2', meaning two bombs in its surroundings.\n\nThe overlapping squares between these two numbers are:\n\n- (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8)\n\nSo, (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8) are the common surrounding squares.\n\nGiven that (7,9) is a '3' and (8,8) is a '2', and both require a certain number of bombs in these squares.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- (7,9) '3' needs three bombs in its surroundings: (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8), (9,9)\n\n- (8,8) '2' needs two bombs in its surroundings: (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nThe overlapping squares are: (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nSo, for (7,9) '3' to have three bombs, and (8,8) '2' to have two bombs, and considering the overlapping squares, perhaps I can deduce something.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated for now. Maybe I should make a move by revealing a square that seems safer.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 0, which is unexplored, and not directly adjacent to any revealed numbers yet.\n\nPerhaps revealing this square is safer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reveal row 6, column 0.\n\nBut I'm still not sure.\n\nMaybe I should just pick a square and hope for the best.\n\nGiven that, I'll choose to reveal row 6, column 0.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Choosing to reveal row 6, column 0 as it seems relatively safe with no immediate surrounding numbers indicating high bomb density.\n\n**MOVE:** 6,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 2 2 2 1 2 .\n4 _ _ _ 1 . . 1 _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ 1 2 2 1 _ 1 .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 .\n7 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 3 .\n8 . 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 2 .\n9 . 1 _ _ _ 1 . . . .", "sucess": true}

The surrounding squares are:\n\n- (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n\nLooking at these squares:\n\n- (6,0): unexplored\n\n- (6,1): unexplored\n\n- (6,2): unexplored\n\n- (7,1): revealed as '1'\n\n- (8,0): unexplored\n\n- (8,1): revealed as '1'\n\n- (8,2): unexplored\n\nWait, (7,1) is revealed as '1', and (8,1) is revealed as '1'. So, the surrounding squares of (7,0) are mostly unexplored, except for (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut, I need to see if there are any flags already placed around here that can help me determine where the bomb is.\n\nLooking at these positions, none of them seem to have flags yet. So, with the '1' at (7,0), and multiple unexplored squares around it, I can't pinpoint exactly where the bomb is yet. Maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at row 7, column 1, which is also a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)\n\n- (7,0), (7,2)\n\n- (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n\nAgain, many of these are unexplored, and no flags are placed yet. So, similar situation as above.\n\nPerhaps I should look at row 8, column 1, which is a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\n- (8,0), (8,2)\n\n- (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\nAgain, many unexplored squares, no flags placed yet.\n\nThis area seems too vague to make a confident move. Maybe I should look for areas with more information.\n\nLet's check row 3, column 7, which is a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\n- (3,6), (3,8)\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (2,6): unexplored\n\n- (2,7): unexplored\n\n- (2,8): unexplored\n\n- (3,6): unexplored\n\n- (3,8): unexplored\n\n- (4,6): unexplored\n\n- (4,7): unexplored\n\n- (4,8): unexplored\n\nAgain, nothing helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 5, column 6, which is a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\n- (5,5), (5,7)\n\n- (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (4,5): unexplored\n\n- (4,6): unexplored\n\n- (4,7): revealed as '1'\n\n- (5,5): unexplored\n\n- (5,7): unexplored\n\n- (6,5): unexplored\n\n- (6,6): unexplored\n\n- (6,7): unexplored\n\nStill too many unexplored squares without any flags.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for areas where the numbers are higher, indicating more bombs in the surrounding squares.\n\nLet's look at row 7, column 9, which is a '3'. This means there are three bombs in the eight surrounding squares. The surrounding squares are:\n\n- (6,8), (6,9)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (8,8), (8,9)\n\n- (9,8), (9,9)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (6,8): unexplored\n\n- (6,9): unexplored\n\n- (7,8): unexplored\n\n- (8,8): revealed as '2'\n\n- (8,9): unexplored\n\n- (9,8): unexplored\n\n- (9,9): unexplored\n\nWait, (8,8) is revealed as '2', which means there are two bombs in its eight surrounding squares. The surrounding squares of (8,8) are:\n\n- (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n\n- (8,7), (8,9)\n\n- (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nBut (7,7) is unexplored, (7,8) is unexplored, (7,9) is unexplored, (8,7) is unexplored, (8,9) is unexplored, (9,7) is unexplored, (9,8) is unexplored, (9,9) is unexplored.\n\nSo, for (8,8) being a '2', and all surroundings unexplored, and (7,9) being a '3', which is also surrounded by unexplored squares, this area seems too vague as well.\n\nMaybe I need to look for areas where I can eliminate possibilities based on multiple numbers interacting.\n\nLet's consider row 3, where there are several numbers: column 3 has a '1', column 4 has a '2', column 5 has a '2', column 6 has a '2', column 7 has a '1', column 8 has a '2'.\n\nThis seems like a complex area with multiple interacting numbers. Maybe I can make some deductions here.\n\nLet's map out the surroundings for these numbers and see if I can find any overlaps or contradictions.\n\nStarting with row 3, column 3 ('1'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n- (3,2), (3,4)\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nNow, row 3, column 4 ('2'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\n- (3,3), (3,5)\n\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nRow 3, column 5 ('2'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n- (3,4), (3,6)\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nRow 3, column 6 ('2'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n\n- (3,5), (3,7)\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\nRow 3, column 7 ('1'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\n- (3,6), (3,8)\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\nRow 3, column 8 ('2'):\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n\n- (3,7), (3,9)\n\n- (4,7), (4,8), (4,9)\n\nThis is a lot of overlapping areas. Maybe I can look for squares that are covered by multiple numbers and see if I can deduce anything.\n\nFor example, square (2,5) is surrounded by row 3, column 4 ('2') and row 3, column 5 ('2'). Similarly, square (2,6) is surrounded by row 3, column 5 ('2') and row 3, column 6 ('2').\n\nLet me try to see if I can find any squares that must contain a bomb or must be safe based on these numbers.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 4, which is a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n- (4,3), (4,5)\n\n- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nNow, row 4, column 3 is a '1', and row 4, column 5 is a '2'.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can consider the possibilities for bomb placements in this area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for squares that are only covered by one number, making it easier to determine if they are safe or contain a bomb.\n\nLooking back at the board, I see row 0, column 7 has a '1'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (0,6): unexplored\n\n- (0,8): revealed as '1'\n\n- (1,6): unexplored\n\n- (1,7): revealed as '1'\n\n- (1,8): revealed as '2'\n\n- (2,6): unexplored\n\n- (2,7): unexplored\n\n- (2,8): unexplored\n\nSo, for row 0, column 7 being a '1', and considering the surrounding squares, some are revealed and some are unexplored.\n\nWait, (0,8) is revealed as '1', which means there is one bomb in its eight surrounding squares, which are:\n\n- (0,7), (0,9)\n\n- (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)\n\n- (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nNow, (0,7) is '1', (1,7) is '1', (1,8) is '2', (2,7) is unexplored, (2,8) is unexplored, (2,9) is unexplored, (1,9) is unexplored, (0,9) is unexplored.\n\nThis seems a bit tangled. Maybe I need to consider the possibilities for bomb placements in this small area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for squares that are safe to reveal because they cannot possibly contain a bomb based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 9, which is a '2'. Its surrounding squares are:\n\n- (5,8), (5,9)\n\n- (6,8)\n\n- (7,8), (7,9)\n\n- (8,8), (8,9)\n\n- (9,8), (9,9)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (5,8): unexplored\n\n- (5,9): unexplored\n\n- (6,8): unexplored\n\n- (7,8): unexplored\n\n- (7,9): revealed as '3'\n\n- (8,8): revealed as '2'\n\n- (8,9): unexplored\n\n- (9,8): unexplored\n\n- (9,9): unexplored\n\nSo, for row 6, column 9 being a '2', and considering the surrounding squares, some are revealed with numbers, some are unexplored.\n\nWait, (7,9) is a '3', which means there are three bombs in its eight surrounding squares.\n\nThe surrounding squares of (7,9) are:\n\n- (6,8), (6,9)\n\n- (7,8), (7,10) \u2013 but column 10 doesn't exist, so only up to column 9\n\n- (8,8), (8,9)\n\n- (9,8), (9,9)\n\nSo, the actual surrounding squares are:\n\n- (6,8), (6,9)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (8,8), (8,9)\n\n- (9,8), (9,9)\n\nNow, (6,9) is unexplored, (6,8) is unexplored, (7,8) is unexplored, (8,8) is '2', (8,9) is unexplored, (9,8) is unexplored, (9,9) is unexplored.\n\nGiven that (7,9) is '3', and (8,8) is '2', I need to see if I can deduce any bomb placements here.\n\nBut it's still too vague. Maybe I need to consider the total number of bombs and flags left.\n\nI have 10 flags left, and there are 10 bombs left on the board. So, I need to make sure that I place flags only on squares that are definitely bombs, and reveal the rest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for areas where the number of unexplored squares matches the number of remaining bombs.\n\nBut in this board, with 10 bombs left and many unexplored squares, it's not immediately obvious.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability of certain squares containing bombs based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, in row 0, column 7 being a '1', and having several unexplored squares around it, perhaps I can calculate the probability of each unexplored square containing a bomb.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming, and I'd prefer to make a logical deduction rather than guessing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for squares that are safe to reveal because they are unlikely to be bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 7, which is unexplored, and surrounded by revealed numbers.\n\nWait, row 2, column 7 is unexplored, and it's surrounded by:\n\n- (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)\n\n- (2,6), (2,8)\n\n- (3,6), (3,7), (3,8)\n\nSome of these are revealed numbers, but it's still not clear.\n\nMaybe I need to look for a square that is covered by multiple numbers, where the numbers indicate that it must be safe or must contain a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a square that, if I assume it's a bomb, would conflict with the numbers around it.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should just pick a square that seems safe and reveal it, keeping in mind that I need to be cautious.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 6, which is unexplored, and it's adjacent to row 0, column 7, which is '1'.\n\nIf I reveal row 0, column 6, and it turns out to be a bomb, that would satisfy the '1' at row 0, column 7, since it only needs one adjacent bomb.\n\nBut I don't know if that's the case. Maybe there are multiple possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, if I place a flag on row 0, column 6, then the '1' at row 0, column 7 would be satisfied, but I need to make sure that there are no other bombs adjacent to other numbers.\n\nBut I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs remaining, so I need to use them wisely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for squares that are the only possible locations for bombs based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, if a number has only one unexplored square adjacent to it, then that square must contain a bomb.\n\nBut in this board, most numbers have multiple unexplored squares around them.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 7, which is '1', and it has multiple unexplored squares around it.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 7 is '2', with multiple unexplored squares.\n\nThis is proving difficult. Maybe I need to consider the process of elimination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for squares that are safe to reveal because they cannot contain bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\nBut in this board, with no flags placed yet, it's hard to find such squares.\n\nWait, actually, there are some flags already placed. Looking back at the board, I see that there are no flags placed yet, as all the 'F' entries are missing.\n\nWait, in the board legend, 'F' represents a flagged space, and in the board state, there are no 'F's, only '_', '.', and numbers.\n\nSo, no flags have been placed yet. That means I need to be extra careful where I place flags.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by placing flags on squares that are definitely bombs based on the numbers.\n\nBut in this board, with multiple unexplored squares around each number, it's hard to pinpoint exact locations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place flags on squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers which all indicate that a bomb must be there.\n\nFor example, if one square is adjacent to two different numbers that both require a bomb in that square, then it must contain a bomb.\n\nBut in this board, I don't see such overlaps immediately.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the total number of bombs required based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, add up all the numbers on the board, which would give me the total number of bombs adjacent to revealed numbers.\n\nBut some bombs may be adjacent to multiple numbers, so this wouldn't give me the exact count.\n\nAlso, with 10 bombs left on the board, and 10 flags to place, I need to make sure that I place flags only on squares that are definitely bombs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for areas where the number of unexplored squares equals the sum of the numbers in that area, indicating that all unexplored squares contain bombs.\n\nBut in this board, with many unexplored squares and multiple overlapping areas, it's hard to isolate such sections.\n\nMaybe I should consider revealing a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, in hopes of getting more information.\n\nFor example, revealing row 3, column 6, which is adjacent to row 3, column 5 ('2'), row 3, column 7 ('1'), and row 4, column 6 (unexplored).\n\nBut there's a risk there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reveal a square that is less likely to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, revealing row 2, column 6, which is adjacent to row 1, column 6 ('1'), row 2, column 7 (unexplored), etc.\n\nBut again, it's risky.\n\nPerhaps the safest initial move is to place a flag on a square that is likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking back, maybe I should consider the '3' at row 7, column 9.\n\nIt has three bombs in its surrounding squares.\n\nLooking at its surrounding squares:\n\n- (6,8), (6,9)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (8,8), (8,9)\n\n- (9,8), (9,9)\n\nAll of these are unexplored except for (8,8), which is '2'.\n\nNow, (8,8) being '2' means there are two bombs in its surrounding squares, which include some of the same squares as (7,9).\n\nPerhaps I can consider the combination of these two numbers to deduce where the bombs are.\n\nLet me list the surrounding squares for both:\n\nFor (7,9) '3':\n\n- (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nFor (8,8) '2':\n\n- (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nThe overlapping squares are: (7,8), (8,9), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nSo, for (7,9) '3', there are three bombs in its surrounding squares.\n\nFor (8,8) '2', there are two bombs in its surrounding squares.\n\nNow, if I can find squares that are only associated with one of the numbers, I might be able to deduce something.\n\nBut in this case, most squares are overlapping between the two numbers.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for me to deduce anything confidently.\n\nMaybe I need to look elsewhere on the board.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 7, which is a '1'.

So, (0,8)'s '1' still needs one bomb in its surrounding squares.\n\nPossible bomb locations for (0,8)'s '1' could be (0,9), (1,9), (1,7), (1,8), etc.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider that placing a flag on (0,6) is safe, and proceed with that.\n\nBut I need to make sure that it doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place a flag on (1,6), assuming it might be a bomb based on the '1' at (0,7).\n\nBut then, the '1' at (0,7) would be satisfied, and the '1' at (1,7) would still need one bomb in its surrounding squares.\n\nLooking at (1,7)'s surrounding squares:\n\n- (0,6): flagged\n\n- (0,7): '1'\n\n- (0,8): '1'\n\n- (1,6): flagged\n\n- (1,8): '2'\n\n- (2,6): unexplored\n\n- (2,7): unexplored\n\n- (2,8): unexplored\n\nIf I flag (1,6), then (1,7)'s '1' is satisfied, as it has one flagged adjacent square.\n\nSimilarly, (0,7)'s '1' is satisfied with (0,6) flagged.\n\nBut then, what about (1,8)'s '2'? It would need two bombs in its surrounding squares.\n\nSurrounding squares of (1,8)'s '2' are:\n\n- (0,7): '1'\n\n- (0,8): '1'\n\n- (0,9): unexplored\n\n- (1,7): '1'\n\n- (1,9): unexplored\n\n- (2,7): unexplored\n\n- (2,8): unexplored\n\n- (2,9): unexplored\n\nWith (1,6) flagged, which is not adjacent to (1,8), so it doesn't directly affect it.\n\nSo, (1,8)'s '2' still needs two bombs in its surrounding squares.\n\nPossible candidates could be (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), etc.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative.\n\nMaybe I should try placing a flag on (0,6) and see if that leads to any contradictions.\n\nIf I place a flag on (0,6), then:\n\n- (0,7)'s '1' is satisfied.\n\n- (1,7)'s '1' still needs one bomb.\n\nAssuming (1,6) is safe to reveal.\n\nBut I already considered flagging (1,6), which might satisfy (1,7)'s '1'.\n\nThis is getting too confusing.\n\nPerhaps I need to make a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total number of unexplored squares and the number of bombs left.\n\nThe board is 10x10, so 100 squares in total.\n\nLooking at the board, there are many unexplored squares ('.').\n\nCounting them would give me an idea of how many squares are left to explore.\n\nBut that might not be necessary right now.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs remaining, I need to place flags on exactly the 10 bomb squares.\n\nI need to ensure that the flags are placed correctly without making mistakes, as placing a flag incorrectly could lead to losing the game.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reveal a square that seems safer based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, revealing a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers which suggest that it's unlikely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 3, which is unexplored, and adjacent to row 1, column 3 (unexplored), row 2, column 2 (unexplored), etc.\n\nBut there are no numbers adjacent to it yet, so it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reveal row 0, column 6, accepting the risk that it might be a bomb.\n\nBut I need to proceed carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place a flag on row 0, column 6, assuming it's a bomb based on the '1' at row 0, column 7.\n\nBut then, I need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to place a flag on row 0, column 6.\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag on row 0, column 6 to satisfy the '1' at row 0, column 7.\n\nMOVE: 0,6,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 2 2 2 1 2 .\n4 _ _ _ 1 . . 1 _ 1 .\n5 _ _ _ 1 2 2 1 _ 1 .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 .\n7 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 3 .\n8 . 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 2 .\n9 . 1 _ _ _ 1 . . . .", "sucess": true}
