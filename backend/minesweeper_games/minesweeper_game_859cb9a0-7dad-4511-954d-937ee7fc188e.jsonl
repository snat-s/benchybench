The tile at position (3,1) is adjacent to a '1' and could potentially reveal more about the board, but considering the lack of immediate risk and the potential for gaining more information, let's choose a tile that is not directly adjacent to a low number to avoid potential immediate conflict or game-over. The position (4,1) is a good candidate because it's adjacent to a '2', which means there are bombs nearby, but not so close that we're likely to hit one immediately.
