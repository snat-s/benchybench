Around the (4,5) flag, I see a clear configuration:\n   - The '1' at (4,7) suggests there's only one bomb in the surrounding area\n   - The flag at (4,5) is likely correct\n   - The flag at (7,4) also seems strategically placed near a '1' number\n\n2. The configuration at (8,2) with a flag suggests a probable bomb location\n\n3.
