The \"1\" at position (3,8) also provides important information - it can only have one bomb adjacent to it.\n\n3. Most critically, looking at row 4, the \"1\" at (4,5) is crucial. Since it shows \"1\" and has multiple unrevealed spaces adjacent to it, but must connect with the pattern from point 1, we can deduce that (4,6) must be a bomb.\n\nEXPLANATION: The \"1\" at (3,6) combined with the \"1\" at (4,5) effectively confirms that position (4,6) must contain a bomb.
