Specifically, the area around coordinate (6,5) looks promising.\n\nWe know:\n- There are 3 flags remaining\n- Total bombs are 10\n- The (6,5) square currently has an 'F' flag\n- Around this region, we have revealing numbers like 1 and 2 that can help us deduce bomb locations\n\nNear the flagged (6,5) position, the surrounding numbers suggest high probability of bombs. The 1's and 2's nearby indicate very specific bomb placements.\n\nI'm going to reveal the coordinate (4,5), which looks like a safe space. It's adjacent to the 1's, and the current flag suggests nearby bombs, but this specific coordinate appears safe.\n\nMOVE: 4,5,false\n\nMy reasoning is based on:\n1. The 1 at (3,5) suggests the nearby area is mostly clear\n2. The existing flag at (6,5) implies bomb concentration nearby\n3. (4,5) seems to be in a \"safe corridor\" between numbered tiles\n\nThis reveal should help clarify the surrounding bomb configuration.", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 2 . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ 2 . . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ 1 1 . . . .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n6 1 1 1 _ _ F 2 . . .\n7 . . 2 1 _ _ 1 . . .\n8 . . . 1 _ F F F 2 .\n9 . . . 1 F _ F _ F 1", "sucess": true}
