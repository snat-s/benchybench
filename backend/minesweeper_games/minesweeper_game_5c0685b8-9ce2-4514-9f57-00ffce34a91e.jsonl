We should start by analyzing these areas to see if we can deduce the location of any bombs. \n\nOne area that stands out is the top-right corner, where we have a '1' at position (0,3) and another '1' at position (1,3). Since these '1's are adjacent to each other, it's likely that the bomb is located in one of the two unexplored spaces above or below them. However, we can't determine which one it is yet.\n\nAnother area of interest is the middle-left side, where we have a '2' at position (2,1) and a '1' at position (2,2). The '2' already has one adjacent '1', so it's likely that the second bomb is located in one of the unexplored spaces adjacent to the '2'.\n\nConsidering the remaining number of flags (10) and bombs (10), we should be cautious not to place too many flags without sufficient evidence.\n\nFor our next move, let's reveal a tile that is likely to give us more information. A good candidate is the tile at position (3,2), which is adjacent to the '1' at position (3,1) and the '1' at position (2,2). Revealing this tile will give us more information about the potential location of the bomb.\n\nMOVE: 3,2,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 . 2 1 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _\n3 1 1 _ _ _ 1 . 2 1 _\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . 1 _\n5 1 1 1 _ _ 1 2 . 2 1\n6 . . 2 _ _ 1 . . . .\n7 . . 2 _ _ 1 . . . .\n8 1 1 1 _ 1 1 . . . .\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Let's analyze the situation around the revealed numbers. \n\nLooking at the top-left corner, we see two '1's at positions (0,3) and (1,3). Since there are no adjacent flags, we can't determine the exact position of the bomb yet. \n\nHowever, looking at the middle-left area, we see a '2' at position (2,1) with no adjacent flags. This '2' is adjacent to the two '1's mentioned earlier. Considering the constraints, it's likely that one of the bombs is adjacent to the '2' and one of the '1's.\n\nConsidering the remaining number of flags (10) and bombs (10), we should be cautious not to place flags that conflict with the revealed numbers.\n\nOne relatively safe area to explore is the bottom-right corner. There's a '1' at position (8,4) with no adjacent flags, but it's not directly adjacent to any other revealed numbers. However, there's a '.' at position (9,4) that is adjacent to the '1' at position (8,4). Given the constraints, it's possible that the '.' at position (9,4) is a bomb, but we can't be certain yet.\n\nInstead of placing a flag, let's reveal the tile at position (9,5) to gather more information.\n\nMOVE: 9,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 . 2 1 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _\n3 1 1 _ _ _ 1 . 2 1 _\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . 1 _\n5 1 1 1 _ _ 1 2 . 2 1\n6 . . 2 _ _ 1 . . . .\n7 . . 2 _ _ 1 . . . .\n8 1 1 1 _ 1 1 . . . .\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": false}
