If there is already a flag, no further flags are needed here.\n   - Position (1,0): '1' means there is exactly one bomb adjacent.\n     - Adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0). If the cell (0,0) \u20181\u2019 indicates another flag at other posi not allowed.\n\n3. **Flag Verification**:\n   - The flag at (1,2) is next to a '1' at (1,0), which confirms there must be one bomb near (1,0).\n\n4. **Deciding the Next Move**:\n   - Since adjacent cells are still unexplored, let examine potential tiles to reveal further information ensuring revealing can be safe to chase further.\n\nExamining possible move considering the flag and adjacent cells:\n\n1.
