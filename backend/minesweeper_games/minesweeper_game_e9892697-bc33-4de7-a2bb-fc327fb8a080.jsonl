Since this is the first move, there are no revealed numbers or patterns to analyze yet.\n\nThe best first move in Minesweeper is typically to click in the center of the board, as this maximizes the chance of opening up a large area and provides the most information for future moves.\n\nEXPLANATION: Making the first move in the center of the board (position 4,4) to maximize the chance of opening a large area. This is a standard opening strategy in Minesweeper as it provides the most information for future moves.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "I'll analyze the current Minesweeper board to determine a safe move.\n\nFirst, let me examine the revealed numbers:\n- At (3,3) we have a 2\n- At (3,5) we have a 1\n- At (4,3) we have a 3\n- At (4,4) we have a 2\n- At (4,5) we have a 2\n- At (5,3) we have a 1\n- At (5,5) we have a 1\n\nLooking at position (4,3) with a 3, it tells us there are exactly 3 bombs in the 8 surrounding tiles. All 8 tiles around it are currently unexplored.\n\nExamining position (3,3) with a 2, it must have 2 bombs in its surrounding tiles. \n\nLooking at the pattern of numbers, we can deduce that position (5,4) is almost certainly safe. This is because:\n- The 1 at (5,3) needs one bomb in its vicinity\n- The 1 at (5,5) needs one bomb in its vicinity\n- If (5,4) contained a bomb, both the 1 at (5,3) and the 1 at (5,5) would be satisfied with that single bomb\n- However, this would leave too few bombs for the 3 at (4,3) to be satisfied\n\nTherefore, (5,4) is very likely safe to reveal.\n\nEXPLANATION: Position (5,4) is likely safe because it's adjacent to two positions with \"1\" indicators, and if it contained a bomb, it would create inconsistencies with the \"3\" at position (4,3).\n\nMOVE: 5,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . 2 . 1 . . . .\n4 . . . 3 2 2 . . . .\n5 . . . 1 . 1 . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
