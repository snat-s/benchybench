The adjacent unexplored tiles must be clear if this '1' indicates a bomb.\n- Position (1,0) and (8,0) show '1': Both have only one unexplored tile left but no adjacent tiles can be checked there due to all being revealed.\n\n### Decision Making:\n\n1. **Position (0,6) Analysis:**\n   - Adjacent unexplored tiles: (0,7) and (1,6)\n   - Check those tiles and the numbers around them:\n     - Position (0,7) has an adjacent spotted number if not a flag.\n\n2. **Flag placement rule analysis:**\n   - Placing a flag must guarantee it doesn't break any number representation.\n\n### Next Move:\n\nBased on the above analysis, let's proceed to place a flag at (0,7) as it definitely is without safe concrete checks and doesn't confuse any clear-number depictions nearby.\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: Place a flag at (0,7) as there\u2019s a '1' in (0,6) indicating one adjacent bomb, with (0,7) remaining unexplored.\nMOVE: 0,7,true\n```\n\n### Execute move:\n\n```plaintext\nMove: 0,7,true\n```\n\nLet's see if the flag placement works without conflict and proceed further if board changes.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 1 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n2 . 1 _ 1 . 1 _ 1 . .\n3 . 2 1 2 . 2 _ 1 . .\n4 . . . . . 2 _ 1 . .\n5 . . . . . 2 _ 1 1 1\n6 . 2 1 2 1 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n8 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .", "sucess": true}

This means it's possible that there is another bomb next to it.\n\n3. **Consider the Remaining Number of Flags vs bombs:**\n   - We have 9 flags remaining and 10 bombs total, meaning this is close but should be considered when reviewing logical placements.\n\n4. **Decide the Action:**\n   - The numbers already given indicate that the '1' at (0,1) needs to check for bombs in adjacent spaces.\n   - Move pls safely decodes one tile adjacent space to (0, 1) as safer reveal.\n\nLet's reveal the square at (2,0):\n  * This reduces ambiguity right next to '1', confirming up or down visual sweep.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing the square at (2,0) will give us more information about the surrounding area and help us place more flags accurately.\nMOVE: 2, 0, false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ F . .\n1 1 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n2 . 1 _ 1 . 1 _ 1 . .\n3 . 2 1 2 . 2 _ 1 . .\n4 . . . . . 2 _ 1 . .\n5 . . . . . 2 _ 1 1 1\n6 . 2 1 2 1 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n8 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .", "sucess": false}
