The adjacent tiles are (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (7,5), and (7,6). Since (6,6) is already revealed as '1', the bombs must be in two of the remaining four tiles.\n   - At (6,7): The '3' indicates exactly three bombs in its adjacent unexplored tiles.

Let's see if this flag is consistent with the numbers around it.\n  - Position (5,2) shows a '1', indicating exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. Since (5,1) is already flagged, there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (5,2).\n  - The adjacent squares to (5,2) are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\n  - Since (5,1) is flagged, the other adjacent squares must be safe.\n\n### Step 2: Look for obvious conflicts\n- There are no obvious conflicts in the current state. The flag at (5,1) is consistent with the '1' at (5,2).\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\n- There are 9 flags remaining and 10 bombs.
