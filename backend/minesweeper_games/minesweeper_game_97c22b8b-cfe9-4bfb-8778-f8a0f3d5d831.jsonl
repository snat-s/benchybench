While there's still a chance it could be a bomb, starting in a corner gives us the best information-to-risk ratio for subsequent moves.\n\nEXPLANATION: Starting with top-left corner (0,0) as it's a corner position with only 3 possible adjacent bombs instead of 8, giving us better odds and more useful information for future moves.\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
