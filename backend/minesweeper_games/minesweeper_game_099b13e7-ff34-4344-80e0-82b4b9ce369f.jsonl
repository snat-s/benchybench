We currently have one flagged (5,1), and one more bomb must be adjacent to (5,3) given the rules.\n  \n2. The tiles surrounding (5,3) that need consideration are:\n   - (4,2)\n   - (4,3)\n   - (5,2) (which is already flagged)\n   - (6,2) (which is already flagged)\n   - (5,4)\n   - (6,3)\n   - (7,2)\n   \n3. **At (2,3)**, the adjacent squares are less ambiguous because:\n   - (2,2) has a bomb adjacent to it.\n   - The bomb count matches with the flags surrounding it.\n\n4. Analyzing other numbers, we observe that the bomb (1,2) at (1,2) is already satisfied due to the flags on (0,1) and (1,1). Hence, this helps confirm placements further.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince we need to make sure not to place more flags than allowed while ensuring revealed numbers have their correct number of bombs adjacent to them:\n\n1. We can **safely reveal** one of the squares from (5,4) or (6,2).\n2. **I will reveal (5,4)** because revealing a non-flagged tile at this point will help confirm its adjacent squares and assist in resolving further conflicts with flagged squares.\n\n### Final Move:\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal the tile at (5,4) to gather more information about nearby bombs and potentially find safe spaces.\nMOVE: 5,4,false", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n2 _ _ 1 1 . . . . . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n4 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n5 _ F 1 2 . . . . . .\n6 _ _ F . . . . . . .\n7 1 1 2 . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Let's start with the revealed numbers and their adjacent flags:\n   - The '1's at (0, 2), (1, 2), and (2, 2) all have one adjacent flagged tile (which is at (5, 1)), so these are satisfied. \n   - The '2' at (4, 6) has no flags in its adjacent unflagged squares, meaning there is a need for two flags nearby.\n   - The '3' at (5, 4) requires three bombs nearby. It has one adjacent flag at (5, 1) and must have two more bombs in adjacent unexplored tiles.\n   - The '2' at (4, 6) doesn't have any flags nearby among the unexplored tiles, indicating that the adjacent unexplored should contain two bombs.\n\n2.

The '2' at (4, 6) is particularly concerning because it is currently unsatisfied.\n\n5.
