{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nI'm playing a Minesweeper game on a 10x10 board with 10 bombs total, and currently I have 10 flags remaining. The board is completely unexplored, showing only dots (.) in all positions.\n\nSince this is the start of the game and no tiles have been revealed yet, I need to make my first move. In Minesweeper, the first move is generally safe, as most implementations ensure you don't hit a bomb on the first click.\n\nThe standard strategy for the first move in Minesweeper is to click in the middle of the board or in one of the corners, as these positions statistically give us the best chance of opening up a larger area.\n\nLet me go with the middle of the board for the first move. The middle of a 10x10 board would be around coordinates (4,4) or (5,5). I'll choose (4,4).\n\nFor my move, I want to reveal a tile, not place a flag, so the flag parameter should be false.\n\nSo my move will be:\n- x = 4 (row 4)\n- y = 4 (column 4)\n- flag = false (to reveal the tile)\n</think>\n# Minesweeper First Move Analysis\n\nLooking at the current board, we're at the very beginning of a game with a 10x10 grid containing 10 mines. No tiles have been revealed yet, so I need to make my first move.\n\nIn Minesweeper, the first move is typically safe in most implementations. The best starting moves are either:\n1. In the center of the board, to maximize the chance of opening a large area\n2. In a corner, which can sometimes lead to good openings\n\nSince we're starting fresh, I'll choose to click in the center of the board. This gives us the best statistical chance of revealing a large area on the first move and provides more information for subsequent decisions.\n\nEXPLANATION: Making the first move in the center of the board, which is a standard Minesweeper opening strategy to maximize information gained.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
