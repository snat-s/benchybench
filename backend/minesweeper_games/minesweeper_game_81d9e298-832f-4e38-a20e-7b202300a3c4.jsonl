In Minesweeper, the first move is always safe - the game is designed so that the first square you click will never be a bomb.

It's generally best to click somewhere in the middle of the board rather than at the edges or corners.\n2. This maximizes the chance of revealing a large area if we hit an empty space.\n\nThe middle of a 10x10 board would be around coordinates (4,4) or (5,5) or the surrounding area.

Definite bomb locations that need to be flagged\n2. Safe spaces that can be revealed\n\nLet's analyze some specific regions:\n\n### Top-left region:\n- (0,1) shows \"1\" which means one adjacent bomb. The only unrevealed space is (0,2), so it must contain a bomb.\n- (1,1) shows \"1\" which means one adjacent bomb. It has unexplored spaces at (0,0), (1,0), and (1,2).\n- (1,2) shows \"3\" which means three adjacent bombs. It has unexplored spaces at (0,2), (0,3), (1,3).\n- (1,4) shows \"2\" which means two adjacent bombs. It has unexplored spaces in several positions.\n\n### Bottom-left region:\n- (8,1) shows \"2\" which means two adjacent bombs. It has unexplored spaces at (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2).\n- (8,0) shows \"1\" which means one adjacent bomb. It has unexplored spaces at (9,0), (9,1).\n\n### Middle-right region:\n- (5,8) shows \"2\" which means two adjacent bombs. It has unexplored spaces at (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9).\n- (6,6) shows \"2\" which means two adjacent bombs. It has unexplored spaces at (5,7), (6,7), (6,8).\n- (5,6) shows \"1\" which means one adjacent bomb. It has unexplored space at (5,7).\n\nLet's look for clear deductions:\n\n1. At (0,1), there's a \"1\" with only one unexplored adjacent cell at (0,2). This must be a bomb, so we should flag (0,2).\n\n2. At (5,6), there's a \"1\" with only one unexplored adjacent cell at (5,7). This must be a bomb, so we should flag (5,7).\n\n3. Looking at (1,2) with \"3\" and (0,2) which we just determined is a bomb, we need two more bombs adjacent to (1,2). The only candidates are (0,3) and (1,3). Therefore, both must be bombs.\n\nLet's check for any safe reveals:\n\n4. At position (6,6) showing \"2\", if we place a flag at (5,7) and another at (6,7), then (6,8) would be safe to reveal.\n\nI think I should flag (0,2) as it's definitely a bomb based on the \"1\" at (0,1).\n\nLet me check if there are any other certain bomb locations or safe reveals before making my final decision:\n\n5. Let's look at (5,8) showing \"2\" - it has adjacents at (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). If (5,7) is a bomb as we deduced earlier, we need one more bomb among these spaces.\n\n6. Let's look at (6,6) showing \"2\" - it has adjacents at (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). If (5,7) is a bomb as we deduced earlier, we need one more bomb among these spaces.\n\nWait, I need to be more precise. Let me list out the adjacent cells for each number:\n\nFor (0,1) = \"1\":\n- Adjacents: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n- Revealed: (1,1) = \"1\"\n- Unrevealed: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0)\n- We need exactly one bomb among (0,0), (0,2), (1,0)\n\nFor (5,6) = \"1\":\n- Adjacents: (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n- Revealed: (4,6) = empty, (4,7) = \"1\", (5,5) = empty, (6,5) = \"1\", (6,6) = \"2\"\n- Unrevealed: (5,7), (6,7)\n- We need exactly one bomb between (5,7) and (6,7)\n\nI think I don't have enough information yet to determine which of these two cells is the bomb with 100% certainty. Let me look elsewhere.\n\nFor (1,1) = \"1\":\n- Adjacents: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)  \n- Revealed: (0,1) = \"1\", (2,1) = empty, (2,2) = \"1\"\n- Unrevealed: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2)\n- We need exactly one bomb among (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2)\n\nFor (1,2) = \"3\":\n- Adjacents: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n- Revealed: (0,1) = \"1\", (1,1) = \"1\", (2,1) = empty, (2,2) = \"1\", (2,3) = \"1\"\n- Unrevealed: (0,2), (0,3), (1,3)\n- We need exactly three bombs among (0,2), (0,3), (1,3)\n- Since there are only three unrevealed cells, all three must be bombs.\n\nThis confirms that (0,2), (0,3), and (1,3) must be bombs.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can confidently flag (0,2) as a bomb.\n\nLet me look for a safe move to reveal:\n\nIf (0,2), (0,3), and (1,3) are bombs, then:\n- (0,4) must be safe (since if it were a bomb, the \"2\" at (0,4) would have 3 adjacent bombs)\n- Similarly, (1,4) has a \"2\" and would see the bombs at (0,3) and (1,3), so its other adjacent cells must be safe\n\nSo a safe reveal would be at (0,4).\n\nHmm, but (0,4) is already revealed and shows \"2\"... Let me check my coordinates again.\n\nLet me restart my analysis more carefully:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n5 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n6 _ 1 1 1 1 1 2 . . .\n7 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n8 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nI need to be careful about the coordinate system. In this problem, the first coordinate is the row (y-axis, top to bottom) and the second coordinate is the column (x-axis, left to right).\n\nLet me check the cells around (0,1) which shows \"1\":\n- Adjacent: (-1,0), (-1,1), (-1,2), (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n  - Out of bounds: (-1,0), (-1,1), (-1,2)\n  - Revealed: (0,0) = empty, (1,1) = \"1\"\n  - Unrevealed: (0,2), (1,0), (1,2)\n  - Since (1,2) is revealed as \"3\", the bomb must be at (0,2)\n\nLet me check the cells around (1,2) which shows \"3\":\n- Adjacent: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n  - Revealed: (0,1) = \"1\", (1,1) = \"1\", (2,1) = empty, (2,2) = \"1\", (2,3) = \"1\"\n  - Unrevealed: (0,2), (0,3), (1,3)\n  - Since we need 3 bombs and have 3 unrevealed cells, all three must be bombs: (0,2), (0,3), (1,3)\n\nThis means I can confidently flag (0,2), (0,3), and (1,3) as bombs.\n\nLet me check if this creates any safe reveals:\n\nFor position (2,4) = \"1\":\n- Adjacent: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n- If (1,3) is a bomb, then all other adjacents must be safe\n- Therefore, (2,5) and (3,4) would be safe to reveal\n\nSo I could safely reveal (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, for position (0,4) = \"2\":\n- Adjacent: (-1,3), (-1,4), (-1,5), (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n- Out of bounds: (-1,3), (-1,4), (-1,5)\n- If (0,3) and (1,3) are bombs, then (0,5), (1,5) must be safe\n\nSo I could also safely reveal (0,5).\n\nBased on my analysis, I'll flag (0,2) as a bomb for my move.\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the board carefully, I can make a logical deduction in the top-left area:\n\nThe \"1\" at position (0,1) has only one unexplored adjacent tile at (0,2). This means (0,2) must be a bomb.\n\nAdditionally, the \"3\" at position (1,2) has only three unexplored adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), and (1,3). Since we need exactly 3 bombs adjacent to this position, all three of these must be bombs.\n\nSince I've identified (0,2) as a definite bomb location based on the \"1\" at (0,1), I'll flag it.\n\nEXPLANATION: The \"1\" at (0,1) has only one unexplored adjacent cell at (0,2), which must contain a bomb.\nMOVE: 0,2,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n5 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n6 _ 1 1 1 1 1 2 . . .\n7 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n8 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nLet me analyze the current Minesweeper board to determine the safest move.\n\nFirst, I'll check all revealed numbers against existing flags to identify any conflicting information or clear moves.\n\nI see one flagged square at (0,2) marked as 'F'. I need to verify that this makes sense with the surrounding revealed numbers.\n\nLooking at the board:\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 F . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n5 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n6 _ 1 1 1 1 1 2 . . .\n7 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n8 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n\nLet's check the flag at (0,2):\n- Adjacent to this flag is a 1 at (0,1), a 3 at (1,2), and a 1 at (2,2)\n- For the 1 at (0,1), the flag accounts for its 1 bomb\n- For the 3 at (1,2), it accounts for 1 of 3 bombs\n- For the 1 at (2,2), it accounts for its 1 bomb\n\nThis seems consistent so far. Let's look for obvious moves:\n\n1. At (1,2) we have a 3, which is adjacent to one flag. This means there are 2 more bombs adjacent to it. These could be at (0,3), (1,3), or (2,3) since all other adjacent squares are revealed.\n\n2. At (0,4) we have a 2. It's adjacent to the unexplored (0,3) and several unexplored squares to its right.\n\n3. At (1,4) we have a 2. It's adjacent to the unexplored (1,3) and several unexplored squares to its right.\n\n4. Looking at (5,8) with a 2, it has adjacent unexplored squares at (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), and (6,9).\n\n5. At (6,6) there's a 2, adjacent to unexplored squares at (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), and (7,7).\n\nLet me look for any definite moves:\n\nIf I consider the 3 at (1,2) and the adjacent 1s at (0,1) and (2,2), I can determine that (0,3) and (1,3) are both mines. The reasoning: the 3 at (1,2) must have 3 mines, and other than the already-flagged (0,2), only (0,3), (1,3), and (2,3) are candidates. Since (2,3) is the only square adjacent to (2,2) that could contain a mine, and (2,2) shows 1, (2,3) must have a mine. That means both (0,3) and (1,3) must have mines to satisfy the 3 at (1,2).\n\nActually, wait. I need to be more careful. Let me enumerate all adjacent squares to each number:\n\nFor the 3 at (1,2):\n- Adjacent squares: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n- Known mines: (0,2) [flagged]\n- Known safe: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) [all revealed]\n- Unknown: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3)\n- Thus, there must be 2 more mines in {(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)}\n\nFor the 1 at (2,2):\n- Adjacent squares: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n- Known mines: None flagged\n- Known safe: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) [all revealed]\n- Unknown: (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n- Thus, there must be 1 mine in {(1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\nFor the 2 at (0,4):\n- Adjacent squares: (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n- Known mines: None flagged\n- Known safe: (1,4) [revealed]\n- Unknown: (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5)\n- Thus, there must be 2 mines in {(0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5)}\n\nFor the 2 at (1,4):\n- Adjacent squares: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n- Known mines: None flagged\n- Known safe: (0,4), (2,3), (2,4) [all revealed]\n- Unknown: (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,5)\n- Thus, there must be 2 mines in {(0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,5)}\n\nNow I need to look for constraints that can help me deduce safe moves or mines:\n\nLooking at the 3 at (1,2) and the 1 at (2,2), I can say:\n- The 3 at (1,2) needs 2 more mines among {(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)}\n- The 1 at (2,2) needs 1 mine among {(1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\nIf (2,3) contains a mine, then the 3 at (1,2) needs 1 more from {(0,3), (1,3)}, and the 1 at (2,2) is satisfied.\nIf (2,3) does not contain a mine, then the 3 at (1,2) needs both (0,3) and (1,3) to be mines, and the 1 at (2,2) needs a mine from {(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}.\n\nLet's also consider the constraints from the 2s at (0,4) and (1,4):\n- The 2 at (0,4) needs 2 mines among {(0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5)}\n- The 2 at (1,4) needs 2 mines among {(0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,5)}\n\nLet's see if we can make deductions by combining these constraints...\n\nIf (0,3) is a mine, that contributes 1 to both 2s at (0,4) and (1,4), leaving each needing 1 more. The 3 at (1,2) still needs 1 more from {(1,3), (2,3)}.\n\nIf (1,3) is a mine, it contributes 1 to both 2s and 1 to the 3, leaving the 3 needing 1 more from {(0,3), (2,3)}.\n\nLooking at these constraints, I'm leaning towards (1,3) being a mine, since it satisfies multiple constraints. But I need more definitive reasoning.\n\nThe total number of bombs is 10, and we have 1 flag placed, so 9 more bombs to identify. Let me see if there are any clear deductions I can make.\n\nLooking at (5,8) with a 2 and surrounding unexplored squares, I don't see immediate deductions.\n\nLooking at (6,6) with a 2, similarly, no immediate deductions.\n\nLet me return to the upper-left region:\n\nThe 1 at (0,1) is satisfied by the flag at (0,2).\nThe 3 at (1,2) needs 2 more bombs in {(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)}.\n\nThe key is to understand how the 3 at (1,2) interacts with the 2s at (0,4) and (1,4).\n\nActually, given the constraints from the 3 at (1,2) and the 2s at (0,4) and (1,4), I believe (1,3) must be a mine. It contributes to the 3 and both 2s.\n\nLet me flag (1,3) as a mine.\n\nActually, I should be more systematic here. Let me check if there are any 100% safe moves or definite mines:\n\nFor the 3 at (1,2), we know there must be 2 more mines in {(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)}. But we don't know which 2.\n\nFor the 2 at (0,4), there must be 2 mines in {(0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5)}. But again, not sure which 2.\n\nI don't see any 100% certain mines or safe squares in the upper left region yet.\n\nLet me try a different area of the board - the bottom right:\n\nAt (5,8) there's a 2, meaning 2 mines in {(4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)}. I know from revealed numbers that (4,7) and (4,8) are safe, so the 2 mines are in {(4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)}.\n\nAt (5,6) there's a 1, meaning 1 mine in {(4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)}. I know from revealed numbers that (4,6), (4,7), (6,6) are safe, so the 1 mine is in {(4,5), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7)}.\n\nGiven the 1 at (5,6) and the 2 at (5,8), is there a definite mine placement? If (5,7) is a mine, it satisfies part of both constraints. But that's not definitive yet.\n\nLet me check one more area:\n\nAt (6,6) there's a 2, meaning 2 mines in {(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)}. From revealed numbers, I know (5,6) and (6,5) are safe, so the 2 mines are in {(5,5), (5,7), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)}.\n\nNow, the 2 at (6,6) and the 1 at (5,6) together suggest that (5,7) might not be a mine (because if it were, the 2 at (6,6) would need one more mine, potentially from {(6,7), (7,7)}, but that would make it hard to satisfy other constraints).\n\nWithout clearer deductions, I'll need to pick a move that has the lowest probability of hitting a mine.\n\nLooking back at the board, I notice that there are some unexplored areas that are far from known constraints. These might be safer to reveal:\n\n- The top-right section (rows 0-2, columns 5-9)\n- The middle section (rows 3-4, columns 0-5)\n- The bottom-left corner (row 9, column 0)\n\nGiven the board state and constraints, I'll choose to reveal (3,0), which is away from known mines and constraints.\n\nMOVE: 3,0,false\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the current board state carefully:\n\n1) In the upper-left corner:\n   - The 3 at position (1,2) has one adjacent flag at (0,2)\n   - It needs two more mines in positions {(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)}\n   - The 2s at (0,4) and (1,4) also touch these positions\n   - Based on these constraints, one of these positions must be a mine\n\n2) In the bottom-right area:\n   - At (5,8) there's a 2 with several unknown adjacent cells\n   - At (6,6) there's a 2 with several unknown adjacent cells\n   - No clear determinations can be made here yet\n\n3) Looking for safe moves:\n   - Position (3,0) is far from any known constraints\n   - It's in an unexplored region away from the current numbered cells\n   - This makes it a reasonable choice with minimum known risk\n\nSince I cannot make a 100% certain determination about any mine location, I'll explore a position away from the current revealed numbers to gain more information.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing position (3,0) which is away from current constraints and likely to provide new information with minimal risk.\nMOVE: 3,0,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 F . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n5 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n6 _ 1 1 1 1 1 2 . . .\n7 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n8 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

They have some unexplored adjacent tiles, but I don't see a definitive pattern yet.\n\nLooking at the middle-right area:\n- Positions (4,6), (4,7), and (4,8) all show '1', and they have unexplored tiles below them.\n- Position (5,8) shows a '2'. It has unexplored tiles around it.\n- Position (5,9) shows a '1'. \n- Position (6,6) shows a '2'. It has unexplored tiles to its right.\n\nThe bottom left area:\n- Position (6,1) to (6,5) all show '1', with unexplored tiles below them.\n- Position (7,1) shows a '1' with unexplored tiles around it.\n- Positions (8,1) shows a '2' and (8,0) shows a '1' with unexplored areas around them.\n\nLet me look for obvious safe moves first:\n\nAt position (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4), we have '1's. These are adjacent to the top area, and we need to check if any bombs are already accounted for.\n\nLet's focus on (6,6) which shows a '2'. The unexplored tiles adjacent to it are (5,7), (6,7), (6,8). Since there are 3 unexplored tiles but 2 bombs needed, I can't make a definitive decision yet.\n\nLet me look more systematically at the edges of explored areas for safe moves:\n\nIn the top section, positions (0,3) and (1,3) are unexplored and adjacent to numbers. Position (1,3) is adjacent to a '3' at (1,2), but also adjacent to other numbers. I can't determine if it's safe yet.\n\nLet me look at positions (5,7), (6,7), and (6,8) more carefully:\n- Position (5,7) is adjacent to a '1' at (4,7) and a '1' at (5,6).\n- Position (6,7) is adjacent to a '2' at (6,6).\n- Position (6,8) is adjacent to a '2' at (6,6) and a '2' at (5,8).\n\nLet's try something else:\n\nLooking at the bottom-left corner, position (9,0) is unexplored and adjacent to a '1' at (8,0). However, this '1' could refer to a bomb at (8,1), (9,1), or (9,0), so I can't be sure it's safe.\n\nLet me check if there are any positions where I can say with confidence there's a bomb:\n\nPosition (0,5) is unexplored and adjacent to a '2' at (0,4). However, there are multiple unexplored tiles around (0,4), so I can't be certain.\n\nOh, let me try a different approach. Let's look at positions (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8):\n- Position (5,6) shows a '1'. The only unexplored tile adjacent to it is (5,7). This means (5,7) definitely contains a bomb! I should flag it.\n\nLet me continue analyzing other positions:\n\nLooking at positions (4,6), (4,7), and (4,8), each showing '1':\n- (4,6) has unexplored tiles at (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n- (4,7) has unexplored tiles at (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (5,7), (5,8)\n- (4,8) has unexplored tiles at (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (5,8), (5,9)\n\nGiven that (5,7) definitely contains a bomb (as determined earlier), that accounts for the '1' at (4,7). This means all other tiles adjacent to (4,7) are safe. So positions (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), and (5,8) should be safe.\n\nHowever, position (5,8) is adjacent to a '2' at (5,8) itself. Wait, that's not right... let me re-check. Position (5,8) shows a '2'. Since one bomb is at (5,7), there's one more bomb adjacent to (5,8). This could be at (4,9), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), or (6,9).\n\nActually, I need to be more careful with my analysis. Let me start fresh with clearer observations:\n\nPosition (5,6) shows a '1'. It has adjacent unexplored tiles at (5,5) and (5,7). I can't determine definitively which one contains a bomb.\n\nLooking at positions (6,6) (which shows a '2') and (6,7), (6,8) (which are unexplored):\n- If both (6,7) and (6,8) contained bombs, that would satisfy the '2' at (6,6).\n- But then there's also position (5,8), which shows a '2'. It has adjacent unexplored tiles at (5,7), (6,7), and (6,8).\n\nIf both (6,7) and (6,8) were bombs, that would be 2 bombs adjacent to (5,8), which matches the '2'. However, they're also both adjacent to (6,6), which also shows a '2'. This means any other unexplored tiles adjacent to (6,6), like (5,7), must not contain bombs.\n\nSo I can conclude that (5,7) is safe, and I can make a move to reveal it.\n\nHmm, but that's not consistent with my earlier analysis. Let me double-check the board:\n\nPosition (5,6) shows a '1'. It has adjacent unexplored tiles at (5,5) and (5,7).\nPosition (4,7) shows a '1'. It has adjacent unexplored tiles at (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (5,7).\n\nWait, there's something I'm missing. Let me re-examine the entire board more carefully. I need to understand the constraints better.\n\nLet me check position (5,8) again. It shows a '2', meaning there are 2 bombs adjacent to it. The unexplored tiles adjacent to (5,8) are (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), and (6,9). That's 6 unexplored tiles, so I can't make a definitive decision based just on this.\n\nLet me look at position (6,6). It shows a '2', meaning there are 2 bombs adjacent to it. The unexplored tiles adjacent to (6,6) are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,6). Wait, some of these are not unexplored. Let me re-check.\n\nPosition (6,6) shows a '2'. Its adjacent unexplored tiles are (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), probably (5,5) is not even adjacent. Let me double check again:\n\nPosition (6,6) is in row 6, column 6. Tiles adjacent to it would be:\n- (5,5), (5,6), (5,7) (above row)\n- (6,5), (6,7) (same row)\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) (below row)\n\nChecking the board again:\n- (5,5) is unexplored\n- (5,6) shows a '1'\n- (5,7) is unexplored\n- (6,5) shows a '1'\n- (6,7) is unexplored\n- (7,5) is unexplored\n- (7,6) is unexplored\n- (7,7) is unexplored\n\nSo, around (6,6), there are 5 unexplored tiles: (5,5), (5,7), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), and (7,7). Given that (6,6) shows a '2', there are 2 bombs in these 6 unexplored tiles.\n\nOK, let's try to find a clear safe move.\n\nFirst, let's look at the revealed 1's in the top-left:\n- Position (0,1) shows a '1'. It has a flag at (0,2). All other adjacent tiles should be safe. This means positions (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1) should be safe. But actually, (1,1) is already revealed and shows a '1', which is consistent (it's counting the flag at (0,2)). And positions (0,0) and (1,0) are also already revealed as empty spaces.\n\nOK, let's try to find a clear safe move by looking at boundary positions.\n\nActually, let's try another approach. Let's check position (0,3), which is unexplored. It's adjacent to position (1,3), which is also unexplored. Position (1,3) is adjacent to position (1,2), which shows a '3'. This means there are 3 bombs adjacent to (1,2).\n\nPosition (1,2) is adjacent to:\n- (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) (above row)\n- (1,1), (1,3) (same row)\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) (below row)\n\nOf these, (0,2) is flagged as a bomb. Additionally, (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) are all revealed and don't contain bombs. This means there are 2 more bombs adjacent to (1,2), and they must be at positions (0,3) and (1,3).\n\nSo, I can flag both (0,3) and (1,3) as bombs.\n\nActually, I think there was a logical error in my analysis above. Let me think more systematically.\n\nPosition (1,2) shows a '3', meaning there are 3 bombs adjacent to it. One of them is at (0,2), which is flagged. So there are 2 more bombs adjacent to (1,2). These must be among the tiles (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nBut (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) are all revealed and don't contain bombs (they show numbers). So the 2 remaining bombs must be at positions (0,3) and (1,3). I can flag both of these as bombs.\n\nThat's my conclusion. I'll flag either (0,3) or (1,3) as a bomb.\n\nActually let me double-check the board one more time:\n\n- The '1' at position (0,1) has one bomb adjacent. This is the flag at (0,2).\n- The '1' at position (1,1) has one bomb adjacent. This is the flag at (0,2).\n- The '3' at position (1,2) has three bombs adjacent. The flag at (0,2) accounts for one, but we're missing two. The remaining unexplored positions adjacent to (1,2) are (0,3) and (1,3). These must be the two missing bombs!\n\nSo, again, positions (0,3) and (1,3) contain bombs. I'll flag one of them.\n\nI'll flag position (0,3) as a bomb.\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the board carefully, I can see a definitive move based on the numbered tiles.\n\nLet me focus on position (1,2) which shows a '3'. This means there are exactly 3 bombs adjacent to it. Looking at its neighbors:\n- (0,2) is already flagged as a bomb (1 accounted for)\n- (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) are all revealed as safe tiles\n- Only (0,3) and (1,3) remain unexplored\n\nSince we need exactly 3 bombs adjacent to the '3' tile, and we've already identified 1 bomb (the flagged tile), the remaining 2 bombs MUST be at positions (0,3) and (1,3).\n\nI'll flag one of these positions now.\n\nEXPLANATION: Position (1,2) shows a '3' with only one adjacent flag. The other two bombs must be at (0,3) and (1,3). I'm flagging one of these certain bomb locations.\nMOVE: 0,3,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 F . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n5 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n6 _ 1 1 1 1 1 2 . . .\n7 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n8 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

It's not showing a number in the board state, so it's either unexplored (marked as '.') or empty revealed ('_').\n\nLooking at the board state:\n```\n0 _ 1 F F 2 _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n```\nPosition (1,3) is marked as '.', which means it's unexplored. Given our analysis, this should be a bomb.\n\nLet's double check:\n- (1,2) = 3 with two adjacent flags at (0,2) and (0,3)\n- One more bomb needed, which must be at (1,3)\n\nSo I'll flag position (1,3).\n\nMOVE: 1,3,true (place a flag at row 1, column 3)\n\nActually, before making my final decision, let me check if there are any simpler or more definitive moves.\n\nLooking at position (6,7), (6,8), and (6,9) which are all unexplored:\nAdjacent to (6,7) is (6,6) = 2, which means at least one bomb is in those unexplored tiles.\n\nLooking at (5,7) which is unexplored:\n- Adjacent to (5,6) = 1\n- Adjacent to (5,8) = 2\n- Adjacent to (4,7) = 1\n\nLet me check if there's a definitive conclusion about (5,7). If (5,6) = 1 has its bomb accounted for elsewhere, then (5,7) would be safe.
