Since (5,6) already has one bomb adjacent (which is (5,7) flagged), there should be no other bombs adjacent to (5,6). This seems consistent.\n\n**No obvious conflicts found.**\n\n### Step 3: Considering Remaining Flags vs Bombs\n\nTotal bombs: 10\nFlags placed: 3 (at (5,7), (7,0), (7,2))\nFlags remaining: 7\n\nWe have 10 bombs and 7 flags left to place. We need to carefully place flags where we are confident there are bombs.\n\n### Step 4: Deciding on the Next Move\n\nLet's look for cells where we can confidently place a flag.\n\n#### Analyzing Cell (7,1): Number '3'\nAdjacent cells:\n- (6,0): `_`\n- (6,1): `1`\n- (6,2): `1`\n- (7,0): `F`\n- (7,2): `F`\n  \nAdjacent to two flags, so there must be one more bomb adjacent to (7,1). The possible unexplored adjacent cells are (6,0).\n\n**Potential bomb at (6,0).**\n\nHowever, (6,0) is already revealed as `_`, which is empty. Wait, let's double-check:\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\n```\n6  _ 1 1 1 1 1 2 . 2 1\n```\n\nSo, (6,0) is `_`, which is empty. Therefore, there is no bomb at (6,0). This suggests that our earlier assumption might be incorrect.\n\nWait, let's re-examine (7,1):\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- (6,0): `_` (empty)\n- (6,1): `1` (already has one bomb adjacent, but we don't know where)\n- (6,2): `1` (same as above)\n- (7,0): `F` (flagged)\n- (7,2): `F` (flagged)\n  \nSince (6,0) is empty, and (6,1) and (6,2) are '1's, but we don't know where their bombs are, it's possible that the required third bomb for (7,1) is at (6,1) or (6,2).\n\nHowever, (6,1) and (6,2) are both '1's, so they cannot both have bombs adjacent to (7,1). This suggests that our initial flag placements might be conflicting with the numbers.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Perhaps the flags at (7,0) and (7,2) are correct, and there is no bomb at (6,0). Then, where is the third bomb for (7,1)?\n\nLooking at (7,1):\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- (6,0): `_` (empty)\n- (6,1): `1`\n- (6,2): `1`\n- (7,0): `F` (flagged)\n- (7,2): `F` (flagged)\n  \nIf (6,0) is empty, and (6,1) and (6,2) are '1's, then the third bomb must be either at (6,1) or (6,2).\n\nBut both (6,1) and (6,2) are '1's, and they cannot both be bombs because then (6,1) would have two bombs adjacent (which is not possible since it's '1').\n\nTherefore, there is a conflict here. This indicates that one of the flags at (7,0) or (7,2) might be incorrectly placed.\n\nLet's consider removing one of these flags to resolve the conflict.\n\n#### Deciding Which Flag to Remove\n\nLet's analyze which flag might be incorrect.\n\n**Flag at (7,0):**\nAdjacent cells:\n- (6,-1): Invalid (off the board)\n- (6,0): `_` (empty)\n- (7,1): `3`\n  \nIf we remove the flag at (7,0), then (7,1) would still have one flag at (7,2) and require two more bombs adjacent. But (6,0) is empty, so the only available cell is (6,1) or (6,2), which are both '1's.\n\nThis still leads to a conflict because (6,1) and (6,2) cannot both be bombs.\n\n**Flag at (7,2):**\nAdjacent cells:\n- (6,2): `1`\n- (7,1): `3`\n  \nIf we remove the flag at (7,2), then (7,1) would have one flag at (7,0) and require two more bombs adjacent. The available cells are (6,0) (empty) and (6,1) or (6,2).\n\nAgain, (6,1) and (6,2) cannot both be bombs, leading to the same conflict.\n\nThis suggests that both flags at (7,0) and (7,2) might be incorrectly placed. However, we have only 10 bombs, and removing both flags would mean we have to find bombs elsewhere.\n\nLet's consider that perhaps one of the flags is correct, and the other is not.\n\nSuppose the flag at (7,0) is correct. Then, (7,1) has one flag at (7,0) and requires two more bombs adjacent. The only available cells are (6,1) and (6,2).\n\nBut (6,1) and (6,2) are both '1's, so they cannot both be bombs. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if the flag at (7,2) is correct, then (7,1) has one flag at (7,2) and requires two more bombs adjacent. Again, the only available cells are (6,1) and (6,2), which cannot both be bombs.\n\nThis indicates that our initial assumption that both flags at (7,0) and (7,2) are correct is leading to a conflict. Therefore, at least one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\nGiven that, let's consider removing one of these flags to resolve the conflict.\n\nLet's choose to remove the flag at (7,0).\n\n**Move: Remove flag at (7,0).**\n\nHowever, according to the game's move format, to remove a flag, we need to make a move with `flag=true` on an already flagged square. So, to remove the flag at (7,0), we would do:\n\n**MOVE: 7,0,true**\n\nBut let's reconsider if this is the best move.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to resolve the conflict without removing a flag. Let's explore other possibilities.\n\n#### Analyzing Cell (6,6): Number '2'\nAdjacent cells:\n- (5,5): `1`\n- (5,6): `1`\n- (5,7): `F`\n- (6,5): `1`\n- (6,7): `.`\n  \nAdjacent to one flag at (5,7). So, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (6,6).\n\nThe only unexplored adjacent cell is (6,7). Therefore, (6,7) must be a bomb.\n\n**Potential bomb at (6,7).**\n\nPlacing a flag here would be a safe move.\n\n**MOVE: 6,7,true**\n\nBut let's verify this.\n\nIf we place a flag at (6,7), then:\n\n- (6,6) has two adjacent bombs: (5,7) and (6,7), which matches the number '2'.\n  \nThis seems consistent.\n\nHowever, we need to check if this flag placement conflicts with any other numbers.\n\nLet's check adjacent cells to (6,7):\n\n- (5,6): `1`\n  \nAdjacent to (6,7) flagged. So, (5,6) already has one bomb adjacent (which is (5,7) flagged). Therefore, there should be no other bombs adjacent to (5,6).\n\nLooking at (5,6):\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- (4,5): `1`\n- (4,6): `_`\n- (4,7): `_`\n- (5,5): `1`\n- (5,7): `F`\n  \nOnly one bomb adjacent, which is (5,7) flagged. So, no additional bombs. This is consistent.\n\nTherefore, placing a flag at (6,7) does not create any conflicts.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter careful analysis, the safest move is to place a flag at (6,7) because it resolves the requirement of cell (6,6) needing two adjacent bombs, one of which is already flagged at (5,7).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** To satisfy the '2' at cell (6,6), which already has one adjacent flag at (5,7), there must be one more bomb adjacent.

My goal is to use these numbers to deduce the locations of the bombs and safely reveal non-bomb squares.\n\nLet's start by examining some key numbers and their adjacent squares:\n\n#### Square (0,1) with a '1'\n\n- **Adjacent Squares:**\n  - (0,0): Unexplored (.)\n  - (0,2): Empty (_)\n  - (1,0): Unexplored (.)\n  - (1,1): '1'\n\nSince (0,1) has a '1', there must be exactly one bomb in its adjacent unexplored squares. Currently, (0,0) and (1,0) are unexplored. However, (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1), but since (0,1) already has a '1', and (1,1) is a '1', we need to consider the implications.\n\n#### Square (1,1) with a '1'\n\n- **Adjacent Squares:**\n  - (0,0): Unexplored (.)\n  - (0,1): '1'\n  - (0,2): Empty (_)\n  - (1,0): Unexplored (.)\n  - (1,2): Empty (_)\n  - (2,0): Unexplored (.)\n  - (2,1): '2'\n  - (2,2): Empty (_)\n\nAgain, (1,1) indicates there's one bomb adjacent to it. The unexplored squares are (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0).\n\n#### Square (2,1) with a '2'\n\n- **Adjacent Squares:**\n  - (1,0): Unexplored (.)\n  - (1,1): '1'\n  - (1,2): Empty (_)\n  - (2,0): Unexplored (.)\n  - (2,2): Empty (_)\n  - (3,0): Empty (_)\n  - (3,1): '1'\n  - (3,2): Empty (_)\n\nSquare (2,1) has a '2', meaning there are two bombs adjacent to it. The unexplored squares here are (1,0) and (2,0).\n\n### Identifying Potential Bomb Locations\n\nLet's focus on the unexplored squares adjacent to (1,1) and (2,1):\n\n- **Square (1,0):** Adjacent to (1,1) and (2,1)\n- **Square (2,0):** Adjacent to (2,1) and (3,0)\n\nGiven that (2,1) requires two adjacent bombs, and (1,1) requires one adjacent bomb, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. **If (1,0) is a bomb:**\n   - This would satisfy the '1' at (1,1).\n   - Then, (2,1) would still need one more bomb, which could be at (2,0).\n\n2. **If (1,0) is not a bomb:**\n   - (1,1) still needs one bomb, which would have to be at (2,0).\n   - However, (2,1) requires two bombs, but only (2,0) would be a bomb in this scenario, leaving (2,1) unsatisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that both (1,0) and (2,0) are bombs.\n\n#### Verifying with Square (0,1)\n\nNow, let's check if placing bombs at (1,0) and (2,0) affects square (0,1):\n\n- **Square (0,1):** Adjacent to (0,0) and (1,0)\n- If (1,0) is a bomb, then (0,1) already has one bomb adjacent to it (satisfying its '1').\n\nThis means (0,0) cannot be a bomb because (0,1) only needs one bomb adjacent to it.\n\n### Deciding the Next Move\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n\n- **Bombs are located at (1,0) and (2,0).**\n- **Square (0,0) is safe to reveal.**\n\nTherefore, the next logical move is to reveal square (0,0).\n\n### Final Move\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the numbers at (1,1) and (2,1), it's deduced that squares (1,0) and (2,0) must contain bombs. Consequently, square (0,0) is safe to reveal as it cannot be a bomb without violating the adjacent number constraints.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n3 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 1\n4 1 1 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 F 1 _\n6 _ 1 1 1 1 1 2 F 2 1\n7 F 3 F . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

To do this, I'll look at the numbered squares and use the information they provide.\n\n#### **Analyzing Numbered Squares**\n\nLet's go through each numbered square and see what we can deduce.\n\n1. **Square (0,0)**: Shows a '1'. This means there is exactly one bomb in the adjacent squares.\n   \n   Adjacent squares: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n   \n   - (0,1): Shows a '1' (already has a bomb adjacent).\n   - (1,0): '.'

This is assumed to be a bomb.\n\n2. **Square (7,2)**: Flagged as 'F'. This is assumed to be a bomb.\n\n3. **Square (6,7)**: Flagged as 'F'. This is assumed to be a bomb.\n\nSo, we have three flagged bombs. We have a total of 10 bombs, so 7 more to find.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (7,1)**\n\nSquare (7,1) shows a '3'. Let's see how many adjacent bombs it has.\n\nAdjacent squares: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n\n- (7,0): 'F' (bomb).\n- (7,2): 'F' (bomb).\n  \nSo, it already has two bombs adjacent. It needs one more bomb among the remaining adjacent squares: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2).\n\nBut let's see if any of these can be determined.\n\n- (6,0): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (6,1): '1'.\n- (6,2): '1'.\n- (8,0): '.' (unexplored).\n- (8,1): '.' (unexplored).\n- (8,2): '.' (unexplored).\n\nSince (6,0) is empty, the bomb must be among (8,0), (8,1), or (8,2). But we don't have enough information yet.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (6,1)**\n\nSquare (6,1) shows a '1'. Let's see its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\n- (7,0): 'F' (bomb).\n  \nSo, it already has one bomb adjacent. There should be no other bombs among its adjacent squares.\n\nLet's check:\n\n- (5,0): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (5,1): '1'.\n- (5,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (6,0): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (6,2): '1'.\n- (7,1): '3'.\n- (7,2): 'F' (bomb).\n\nSo, the only adjacent bomb is at (7,0), which is already flagged. Therefore, none of the other adjacent squares can be bombs.\n\nThis means:\n\n- (5,0): Safe (already empty).\n- (5,1): '1' (safe, since it's a number).\n- (5,2): '_' (safe, already empty).\n- (6,0): '_' (safe, already empty).\n- (6,2): '1' (safe, it's a number).\n- (7,1): '3' (safe, it's a number).\n- (7,2): 'F' (bomb).\n\n### **Analyzing Square (5,1)**\n\nSquare (5,1) shows a '1'. Let's see its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nWe already know:\n\n- (5,0): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (5,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (6,0): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (6,1): '1' (safe, it's a number).\n- (6,2): '1' (safe, it's a number).\n\nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2).\n\nLet's check these:\n\n- (4,0): '1' (safe, it's a number).\n- (4,1): '1' (safe, it's a number).\n- (4,2): '.' (unexplored).\n\nSo, (4,2) is the only unexplored adjacent square. Since square (5,1) shows a '1' and all other adjacent squares are safe, (4,2) must be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, I should place a flag at (4,2).\n\n### **Updating the Board with the New Flag**\n\nAfter placing a flag at (4,2), let's see how this affects our analysis.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (4,1)**\n\nSquare (4,1) shows a '1'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (4,0): '1' (safe).\n- (4,2): 'F' (bomb, just flagged).\n- (5,0): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (5,1): '1' (safe).\n- (5,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n\nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\n\nLet's check these:\n\n- (3,0): '.' (unexplored).\n- (3,1): '1' (safe, it's a number).\n- (3,2): '1' (safe, it's a number).\n\nSo, (3,0) is the only unexplored adjacent square. Since square (4,1) shows a '1' and we've already flagged (4,2) as a bomb, (3,0) cannot be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, (3,0) is safe and can be revealed.\n\n### **Revealing Square (3,0)**\n\nSince (3,0) is safe, I should reveal it. Upon revealing, it might show a number or be empty.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (3,1)**\n\nSquare (3,1) shows a '1'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (3,0): Now revealed (let's assume it's empty or a number).\n- (4,0): '1' (safe).\n- (4,1): '1' (safe).\n- (4,2): 'F' (bomb).\n- (3,2): '1' (safe).\n\nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nLet's check these:\n\n- (2,0): '.' (unexplored).\n- (2,1): '2' (safe, it's a number).\n- (2,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n\nSo, (2,0) is the only unexplored adjacent square. Since square (3,1) shows a '1' and we've already flagged (4,2) as a bomb, (2,0) cannot be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, (2,0) is safe and can be revealed.\n\n### **Revealing Square (2,0)**\n\nRevealing (2,0) will give us more information. Let's assume it's empty or shows a number.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (2,1)**\n\nSquare (2,1) shows a '2'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (2,0): Now revealed (let's assume it's empty or a number).\n- (2,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (3,0): Revealed (empty or a number).\n- (3,1): '1' (safe).\n- (3,2): '1' (safe).\n\nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nLet's check these:\n\n- (1,0): '.' (unexplored).\n- (1,1): '1' (safe, it's a number).\n- (1,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n\nSo, (1,0) is the only unexplored adjacent square. Since square (2,1) shows a '2' and we've already accounted for adjacent bombs, we need to determine if (1,0) is a bomb.\n\nLet's see if we can deduce this.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (1,1)**\n\nSquare (1,1) shows a '1'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (0,0): '1' (safe).\n- (0,1): '1' (safe).\n- (1,0): '.' (unexplored).\n- (1,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (2,0): Revealed (empty or a number).\n- (2,1): '2' (safe).\n- (2,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n\nSo, the only possible adjacent square that could be a bomb is: (1,0).\n\nSince square (1,1) shows a '1' and all other adjacent squares are safe, (1,0) must be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, I should place a flag at (1,0).\n\n### **Updating the Board with the New Flag**\n\nAfter placing a flag at (1,0), let's see how this affects our analysis.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (0,0)**\n\nSquare (0,0) shows a '1'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (0,1): '1' (safe).\n- (1,0): 'F' (bomb, just flagged).\n- (1,1): '1' (safe).\n\nSo, square (0,0) shows a '1', and we've already flagged (1,0) as a bomb. This means there should be no other bombs adjacent to (0,0).\n\nTherefore, all adjacent squares are accounted for.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (0,1)**\n\nSquare (0,1) shows a '1'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (0,0): '1' (safe).\n- (1,0): 'F' (bomb).\n- (1,1): '1' (safe).\n- (1,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n\nSo, the only possible adjacent square that could be a bomb is: (0,2).\n\nSince square (0,1) shows a '1' and we've already flagged (1,0) as a bomb, (0,2) cannot be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, (0,2) is safe and can be revealed.\n\n### **Revealing Square (0,2)**\n\nRevealing (0,2) will give us more information. Let's assume it's empty or shows a number.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (1,2)**\n\nSquare (1,2) shows a '_' (empty, no bomb). This is safe.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (2,2)**\n\nSquare (2,2) shows a '_' (empty, no bomb). This is safe.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (3,2)**\n\nSquare (3,2) shows a '1'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (2,1): '2' (safe).\n- (2,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (3,1): '1' (safe).\n- (4,1): '1' (safe).\n- (4,2): 'F' (bomb).\n  \nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (3,3), (4,3).\n\nLet's check these:\n\n- (3,3): '.' (unexplored).\n- (4,3): '.' (unexplored).\n\nSince square (3,2) shows a '1' and we've already flagged (4,2) as a bomb, one of the squares (3,3) or (4,3) must be a bomb.\n\nBut we need more information to determine which one.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (3,3)**\n\nSquare (3,3) is unexplored. Let's see if we can deduce its status.\n\nLooking at square (3,3)'s adjacent squares:\n\nAdjacent squares: (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (3,2): '1' (safe).\n- (4,2): 'F' (bomb).\n\nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (2,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nBut let's see if we can find more clues.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (4,3)**\n\nSquare (4,3) is unexplored. Let's see if we can deduce its status.\n\nLooking at square (4,3)'s adjacent squares:\n\nAdjacent squares: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (3,2): '1' (safe).\n- (4,2): 'F' (bomb).\n  \nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4).\n\nThis doesn't provide immediate clarity, so let's look elsewhere.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (4,0)**\n\nSquare (4,0) shows a '1'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (3,0): Revealed (empty or a number).\n- (3,1): '1' (safe).\n- (4,1): '1' (safe).\n- (5,0): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (5,1): '1' (safe).\n\nSo, all adjacent squares are accounted for, and there should be no bombs adjacent to (4,0).\n\n### **Analyzing Square (5,0)**\n\nSquare (5,0) shows a '_' (empty, no bomb). This is safe.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (5,1)**\n\nSquare (5,1) shows a '1'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (4,0): '1' (safe).\n- (4,1): '1' (safe).\n- (4,2): 'F' (bomb).\n- (5,0): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (5,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (6,0): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (6,1): '1' (safe).\n- (6,2): '1' (safe).\n\nSo, all adjacent squares are accounted for, and there should be no bombs adjacent to (5,1).\n\n### **Analyzing Square (6,0)**\n\nSquare (6,0) shows a '_' (empty, no bomb).

Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (5,0): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (5,1): '1' (safe).\n- (5,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (6,0): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (6,2): '1' (safe).\n- (7,0): 'F' (bomb).\n- (7,1): '3' (safe).\n- (7,2): 'F' (bomb).\n\nSo, all adjacent squares are accounted for, and there should be no bombs adjacent to (6,1).\n\n### **Analyzing Square (6,2)**\n\nSquare (6,2) shows a '1'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (5,1): '1' (safe).\n- (5,2): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (6,1): '1' (safe).\n- (7,1): '3' (safe).\n- (7,2): 'F' (bomb).\n  \nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (6,3), (7,3).\n\nLet's check these:\n\n- (6,3): '.' (unexplored).\n- (7,3): '.' (unexplored).\n\nSince square (6,2) shows a '1' and we've already flagged (7,2) as a bomb, one of the squares (6,3) or (7,3) must be a bomb.\n\nBut we need more information to determine which one.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (7,1)**\n\nSquare (7,1) shows a '3'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (7,0): 'F' (bomb).\n- (7,2): 'F' (bomb).\n  \nSo, it already has two bombs adjacent. It needs one more bomb among the remaining adjacent squares: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2).\n\nFrom earlier analysis:\n\n- (6,0): '_' (empty, no bomb).\n- (6,1): '1' (safe).\n- (6,2): '1' (safe).\n  \nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2).\n\nSince square (7,1) shows a '3' and we've already flagged two bombs adjacent, one of these three squares must be a bomb.\n\nBut we need more information to determine which one.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (8,0)**\n\nSquare (8,0) is unexplored. Let's see if we can deduce its status.\n\nLooking at square (8,0)'s adjacent squares:\n\nAdjacent squares: (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (7,0): 'F' (bomb).\n- (7,1): '3' (safe).\n  \nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (8,1), (9,0), (9,1).\n\nThis doesn't provide immediate clarity, so let's look elsewhere.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (8,1)**\n\nSquare (8,1) is unexplored. Let's see if we can deduce its status.\n\nLooking at square (8,1)'s adjacent squares:\n\nAdjacent squares: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (7,0): 'F' (bomb).\n- (7,1): '3' (safe).\n- (7,2): 'F' (bomb).\n  \nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2).\n\nThis doesn't provide immediate clarity, so let's look elsewhere.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (8,2)**\n\nSquare (8,2) is unexplored.

This is one of the bombs.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (7,7)**\n\nSquare (7,7) shows a '.' (unexplored). Let's see if we can deduce its status.\n\nLooking at square (7,7)'s adjacent squares:\n\nAdjacent squares: (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (6,7): 'F' (bomb).\n  \nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8).\n\nThis doesn't provide immediate clarity, so let's look elsewhere.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (6,8)**\n\nSquare (6,8) shows a '2'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (5,7), (5,8), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (6,7): 'F' (bomb).\n  \nSo, it already has one bomb adjacent. It needs one more bomb among the remaining adjacent squares: (5,7), (5,8), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9).\n\nLet's check these:\n\n- (5,7): '.' (unexplored).\n- (5,8): '.' (unexplored).\n- (6,9): '.' (unexplored).\n- (7,7): '.' (unexplored).\n- (7,8): '.' (unexplored).\n- (7,9): '.' (unexplored).\n\nThis doesn't provide immediate clarity, so let's look elsewhere.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (6,9)**\n\nSquare (6,9) shows a '1'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (5,8), (5,9), (6,8), (7,8), (7,9)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (6,8): '2' (safe).\n  \nSo, the only possible adjacent squares that could be bombs are: (5,8), (5,9), (7,8), (7,9).\n\nLet's check these:\n\n- (5,8): '.' (unexplored).\n- (5,9): '.' (unexplored).\n- (7,8): '.' (unexplored).\n- (7,9): '.' (unexplored).\n\nThis doesn't provide immediate clarity, so let's look elsewhere.\n\n### **Analyzing Square (5,7)**\n\nSquare (5,7) shows a '1'. Let's check its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (6,7): 'F' (bomb).\n  \nSo, it already has one bomb adjacent.

(unexplored).\n- (5,8): '.' (unexplored).\n- (6,6): '.' (unexplored).\n- (6,8): '2' (safe).\n\nSo, none of the adjacent squares can be bombs except the already flagged (6,7).\n\nTherefore, all adjacent squares are safe, and we can reveal them.\n\n### **Revealing Adjacent Squares to (5,7)**\n\nSince we've determined that all adjacent squares to (5,7) are safe, except for the already flagged (6,7), we should reveal them.\n\nThese squares are:\n\n- (4,6): Reveal.\n- (4,7): Reveal.\n- (4,8): Reveal.\n- (5,6): Reveal.\n- (5,8): Reveal.\n- (6,6): Reveal.\n\nRevealing these squares will provide more information.\n\n### **Analyzing the Newly Revealed Squares**\n\nUpon revealing these squares, we'll have numbers or empty spaces that can help us further deduce the positions of the remaining bombs.\n\nHowever, since we're making a move based on the current information, we'll proceed with the most logical next step.\n\n### **Determining the Next Move**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the most logical next move is to place a flag at (4,2) because square (5,1) shows a '1', and the only unexplored adjacent square is (4,2), which must be a bomb.\n\n**EXPLANATION**: Square (5,1) shows a '1', and after checking all adjacent squares, only (4,2) is unexplored. Since (4,2) must be the bomb to satisfy the '1' at (5,1), I will place a flag at (4,2).\n\n**MOVE**: 4,2,true", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n3 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 1\n4 1 1 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1 1 _\n6 _ 1 1 1 1 1 2 F 2 1\n7 F 3 F . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Therefore, there should be no other bombs adjacent to (3,1). This suggests that positions (3,2) and (4,1) are safe.\n\n- **Position (6,7):** Flagged\n  - Adjacent numbers:\n    - (5,6): `1`\n    - (5,7): `1`\n    - (5,8): `1`\n    - (6,6): `2`\n    - (6,8): `2`\n    - (7,6): `.`\n    - (7,7): `.`\n    - (7,8): `.`\n  \n  The number at (6,6) is `2`, and there's a flag at (6,7). This means there should be one more bomb adjacent to (6,6). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (5,6), (5,7), and (7,6).\n\n- **Position (7,0):** Flagged\n  - Adjacent numbers:\n    - (6,0): `.`\n    - (6,1): `1`\n    - (7,1): `3`\n    - (8,0): `.`\n    - (8,1): `.`\n  \n  The number at (7,1) is `3`, and there's a flag at (7,0). This suggests there are two more bombs adjacent to (7,1). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (6,0), (6,1), (8,0), and (8,1).\n\n#### Step 2: Identifying Safe Moves\n\nBased on the analysis above, some positions can be determined as safe:\n\n- **Position (3,2):** Adjacent to (3,1) which has a `1` and a flag at (4,2). Therefore, (3,2) must be safe.\n  \n- **Position (4,1):** Adjacent to (3,1) which has a `1` and a flag at (4,2). Therefore, (4,1) must be safe.\n\n#### Step 3: Deciding the Next Move\n\nConsidering the above, revealing position (3,2) or (4,1) seems safe. However, to maximize efficiency, I'll choose the one that might open up more information.\n\n**Choosing to reveal (3,2):**\n\n- **Coordinates:** x=3, y=2\n- **Action:** Reveal (since it's safe)\n\n**Explanation:** Position (3,2) is adjacent to (3,1) which has a `1` and already has a flag at (4,2). Therefore, (3,2) cannot be a bomb and can safely be revealed.\n\n### Final Move\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Revealing position (3,2) is safe because it's adjacent to a `1` at (3,1) which already has a flag at (4,2), ensuring no additional bombs are nearby.\n\n**MOVE:** 3,2,false", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n3 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 1\n4 1 1 F 1 . 1 _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1 1 _\n6 _ 1 1 1 1 1 2 F 2 1\n7 F 3 F . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
