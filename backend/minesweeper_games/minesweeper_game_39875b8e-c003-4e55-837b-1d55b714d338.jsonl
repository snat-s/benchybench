Critical observation:\nThe \"1\" at (3,6) already has an adjacent flag at (4,4), which means all other adjacent tiles to this \"1\" must be safe. Following this logic, the tile at (3,5) must be safe.\n\nEXPLANATION: The \"1\" at position (3,6) already has its required bomb accounted for by the flag at (4,4).
