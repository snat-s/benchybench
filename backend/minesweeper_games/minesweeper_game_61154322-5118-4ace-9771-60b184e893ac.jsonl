{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The board is completely unexplored, all squares are still dots. The game is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining. Since the entire board is hidden, there's no information to go on. The first move in Minesweeper is usually a safe click. Typically, players start by clicking the center or a corner, but since all squares are equally likely to be safe at the beginning, maybe the best bet is to click a corner. Wait, but in Minesweeper, the first click is always safe, right? So no matter where I click, it won't be a bomb. So maybe I should click the center to maximize the chance of opening up a larger area. Wait, but in some versions, the first click might generate the bombs after the first move, ensuring that the first click is safe. So in this case, since the board is all dots, the first move is safe. So I can choose any square. Let's pick the middle, maybe (5,5). That way, when revealed, it might show a number that gives information about surrounding squares. Alternatively, maybe a corner like (0,0) to start. But in standard Minesweeper strategy, starting in the middle can open up more space. Hmm. But since the board is 10x10 and there are 10 bombs, the density is low. So the first click is safe. Let's go with (5,5) and reveal it. That's the best move here.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The entire board is unexplored. The first move in Minesweeper is always safe.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 3, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next move, either placing a flag or revealing a tile. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs left and 10 flags remaining. So, all flags should correspond to bombs.\n\nFirst, I need to scan the board for any numbers that are adjacent to unexplored tiles (.) and see if the existing flags or revealed numbers can help determine where bombs are.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 3 is a '.' surrounded by some numbers. Wait, row 4, column 3 is a '.'? Let me check the board again. The board state for row 4 is: _ _ 1 . 1 1 1 2 . . So, position (4,3) is a '.' (unexplored). Let's see the surrounding numbers. The cell at (4,2) is 1, (4,4) is 1, (3,3) is 1, (5,3) is 1. Hmm, maybe there's a bomb here?\n\nWait, the cell at (4,2) is 1. Let's check adjacent cells. The cells around (4,2) would include (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). But (4,2) is 1, and if there's a bomb adjacent to it, but looking at the surrounding cells. Wait, (3,3) is 1, (4,3) is unexplored. Maybe (4,3) is a bomb? Let's see.\n\nBut also, the cell at (4,4) is 1. The cells around (4,4) would include (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (4,4) is 1. If (4,3) is a bomb, then that would account for the 1 in (4,4), but maybe there's another bomb elsewhere. Wait, but (4,4) is 1, so only one bomb adjacent. If (4,3) is a bomb, then (4,4)'s count would be satisfied. Similarly, (4,2) is 1. If (4,3) is a bomb, then (4,2)'s count would be 1. That seems possible. But are there other possibilities?\n\nAlternatively, maybe (3,3) is adjacent to (4,3). The cell at (3,3) is 1. The cells around (3,3) would include (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). The cell (3,3) is 1. If (4,3) is a bomb, then that would account for the 1 in (3,3). But are there any existing flags around here? Looking at the board, I don't see any flags (F) mentioned. So maybe (4,3) is a bomb. If that's the case, placing a flag there would be correct.\n\nBut wait, let's check other areas. For example, row 8, column 7 is 3. The cell (8,7) is 3. Let's see the adjacent cells. The cells around (8,7) would be (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). The cell (8,7) is 3. The surrounding cells are mostly unexplored. But since there are 10 bombs, maybe this area has multiple bombs. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother area to check is row 5, column 5 which is a '.' (unexplored). Wait, row 5 is: _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . . . So, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is '.'? Wait, no. Let me check again. The row 5 is: _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . . . So, positions (5,0) to (5,9). So (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is '.'? Wait, no. Wait, the row 5 is listed as \"_ _ 1 1 1 1 . . . .\", so (5,0) is _, (5,1) is _, (5,2) is 1, (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is ., (5,7) is ., etc. So (5,6) is unexplored. The cell (5,5) is 1. The adjacent cells to (5,5) would include (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). The cell (4,5) is 1, (4,6) is 1, (5,4) is 1, (6,4) is _, (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2. So (5,5) is 1. If there's a bomb in (5,6), then that would account for the 1. But (6,5) is 2, which might have bombs adjacent. But this area is a bit more complex.\n\nAlternatively, let's go back to the cell (4,3). If (4,3) is a bomb, then the adjacent cells (3,3), (4,2), (4,4), (5,3) would each have their counts. Let's check each:\n\n- (3,3) is 1. If (4,3) is a bomb, then (3,3) has one bomb adjacent, which matches its number. That's good.\n- (4,2) is 1. If (4,3) is a bomb, then (4,2) has one bomb adjacent. Correct.\n- (4,4) is 1. If (4,3) is a bomb, then (4,4) has one bomb adjacent. Correct.\n- (5,3) is 1. If (4,3) is a bomb, then (5,3) has one bomb adjacent. Correct.\n\nSo all these cells would have their counts satisfied if (4,3) is a bomb. That seems like a solid conclusion. Therefore, (4,3) must be a bomb. Since there are 10 flags remaining, placing a flag here would be appropriate.\n\nAnother possible spot: looking at row 6, column 5 is 2. The cell (6,5) is 2. Let's check adjacent cells. The cells around (6,5) are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is ., (6,4) is _, (6,6) is 2, (7,4) is _, (7,5) is 1, (7,6) is . . The cell (6,5) is 2, so there should be two bombs adjacent. Let's see if any flags are already placed here. Since there are no flags mentioned, maybe there are two bombs in the adjacent cells. But without more info, it's hard to tell. But perhaps this area isn't as clear as (4,3).\n\nSo the most obvious move is to place a flag at (4,3). Let's check if there are any conflicts. For example, if we place a flag at (4,3), does that affect any other numbers? The cell (5,3) is 1. If (4,3) is a bomb, then (5,3) has one bomb adjacent, which is correct. Similarly, (3,3) is 1, which would be satisfied. So no conflicts here. Therefore, placing a flag at (4,3) is safe and correct.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (4,3) is surrounded by multiple '1's (positions 4,2; 4,4; 3,3; 5,3). Each of these '1's must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The only unexplored cell adjacent to all these '1's is (4,3), making it a guaranteed bomb. Placing a flag here satisfies all adjacent number constraints without conflicts.\n\nMOVE: 4,3,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 2 . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n3 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n4 _ _ 1 . 1 1 1 2 . .\n5 _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 2 2 . . .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n8 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 3 . .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 6, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next move, either placing a flag or revealing a square. Let's start by analyzing the current state of the board and the given information.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 9 flags remaining. The flags already placed are at (4,3). Let's check the revealed numbers and see if there are any obvious places to flag or reveal.\n\nLooking at the row 4, column 3 (4,3) is flagged. Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell at (4,4) is 1. Since there's a flag at (4,3), that might account for the bomb adjacent to (4,4). Wait, (4,4) is a 1, so the adjacent cells should have exactly one bomb. The flag at (4,3) is adjacent to (4,4), so that's one bomb. Are there any other possible bombs around (4,4)? Let's check the surrounding cells. The cells around (4,4) would be positions (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). The flag is at (4,3), so that's one bomb. The cell (4,4) is 1, so no other bombs should be adjacent. So any other adjacent cells can be safely revealed if they are unexplored. Let's check the cells around (4,4). For example, (5,5) is a '.', which is unexplored. But wait, (4,4) is 1, so all other adjacent cells except (4,3) should be safe. Let's check the cell (5,5). If (5,5) is a '.', maybe we can reveal it. But wait, (5,5) is part of row 5. Let me check row 5.\n\nRow 5: columns 0-5 are '_', then columns 6-9 are '.' except for (5,5) which is '.'? Wait, looking at the board state for row 5: \"_ _ 1 1 1 1 . . . .\". So columns 0-1 are '_', column 2 is 1, columns 3-5 are 1, and columns 6-9 are '.' So (5,5) is 1, not '.'? Wait, maybe I'm misreading the board. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the board state for row 5 is listed as: \"_ _ 1 1 1 1 . . . .\". So columns 0 and 1 are '_', columns 2-5 are 1, and columns 6-9 are '.' So (5,5) is 1. So that's already revealed. Hmm. Then maybe the cell (4,5) is 1. Let me check row 4: columns 4-7 are 1,1,1,2. So (4,5) is 1. So the cell (4,5) is 1. The adjacent cells to (4,5) would include (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). The cell (4,5) is 1, so there should be exactly one bomb adjacent. The flag at (4,3) is not adjacent to (4,5), so that's not part of this. So maybe there's another bomb around (4,5). Let's see. The cells around (4,5) that are unexplored: (3,6) is '_' (since row 3, column 6 is '_'), (4,6) is 1, (5,6) is '.' (since row 5, column 6 is '.'). Wait, (5,6) is '.' so maybe that's a bomb? But (4,5) is 1, so if there's a bomb at (5,6), that would be adjacent to (4,5). But (5,6) is also adjacent to (5,5) which is 1. Let's check (5,5) which is 1. The adjacent cells to (5,5) include (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). The cell (5,5) is 1, so there's exactly one bomb adjacent. If (5,6) is a bomb, then that would account for the 1 in (5,5). But (5,6) is also adjacent to (4,5) which is 1. So if (5,6) is a bomb, then (4,5) would have two bombs adjacent (if there's another bomb elsewhere), but (4,5) is 1. So that's a conflict. Therefore, (5,6) can't be a bomb. So maybe the bomb for (5,5) is somewhere else. Let's check the other adjacent cells. For example, (6,5) is '.' (row 6, column 5 is '.'). If (6,5) is a bomb, then (5,5) would have that as adjacent. But (6,5) is also adjacent to (6,4) which is '_', (6,6) which is 2. Hmm, but (6,5) is part of row 6, which has columns 0-5 as '_', then column 5 is 2. Wait, row 6 is \"_ _ _ _ _ 2 2 . . .\". So columns 5 and 6 are 2, and columns 7-9 are '.' So (6,5) is 2, not '.'? Wait, no. The row 6 is listed as \"_ _ _ _ _ 2 2 . . .\". So columns 0-4 are '_', column 5 is 2, column 6 is 2, and columns 7-9 are '.' So (6,5) is 2. Therefore, (5,5)'s adjacent cells include (6,5) which is 2, but that's a revealed number. So the bomb for (5,5) must be in another cell. Let's check (5,6) which is '.' (since row 5, column 6 is '.'). If (5,6) is a bomb, then (5,5) would have one bomb, which is correct. But (5,6) is adjacent to (4,5) which is 1, so that would account for the bomb there. But then (5,6) is also adjacent to (5,7) which is '.' and (6,6) which is 2. Wait, (6,6) is 2. Let's check (6,6). The cell (6,6) is 2. The adjacent cells would include (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). The cell (6,6) is 2, so there should be two bombs adjacent. If (5,6) is a bomb, then that's one. Where's the other? Maybe (7,6) is a bomb. But (7,6) is '.' (row 7, column 6 is '.'). Let's check row 7: \"_ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\". So column 5 is 1, others are '.' except for the first five columns. So (7,6) is '.'.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's look for cells that have a number equal to the number of adjacent unexplored or flagged cells. For example, if a cell has a number 2 and exactly two unexplored cells adjacent, those must be bombs.\n\nLooking at row 8: (8,5) is 1, (8,6) is 1, (8,7) is 3. Let's check (8,7) which is 3. The adjacent cells would be (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). The cell (8,7) is 3. Let's see the adjacent cells. (7,6) is '.' (unexplored), (7,7) is '.' (since row 7, column 7 is '.'), (7,8) is '.' (row 7, column 8 is '.'), (8,6) is 1, (8,8) is '.' (row 8, column 8 is '.'), (9,6) is '.' (row 9, column 6 is '.'), (9,7) is 1 (row 9, column 7 is 1), (9,8) is '.' (row 9, column 8 is '.'). So there are 6 unexplored cells around (8,7). But the number is 3, so three of those must be bombs. But this seems too vague. Maybe another cell is better.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 7 is 2. Let's check (4,7) which is 2. The adjacent cells are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (3,6) is '_', (3,7) is '_', (3,8) is '.', (4,6) is 1, (4,8) is '.', (5,6) is '.', (5,7) is '.', (5,8) is '.'. So the adjacent unexplored cells are (3,8), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). The number is 2, so two bombs here. But how to determine which ones? Not sure yet.\n\nLet's check row 3. Row 3 has columns 2-4 as 1,1,1. For example, (3,2) is 1. The adjacent cells would include (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (4,3) is flagged. So (3,2) is 1, and there's a flag at (4,3). So that's one bomb. Are there any other bombs adjacent to (3,2)? No, because the number is 1. So all other adjacent cells should be safe. Let's check (2,2), which is '_', but (3,2) is 1. Wait, (2,2) is '_', which is already revealed. So maybe that's not helpful.\n\nLooking at row 6, columns 5 and 6 are 2. Let's check (6,5) which is 2. The adjacent cells include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is '.', (6,4) is '_', (6,6) is 2, (7,4) is '_', (7,5) is 1, (7,6) is '.'. So the unexplored cells here are (5,6) and (7,6). The number is 2, so both (5,6) and (7,6) must be bombs. But wait, if (5,6) and (7,6) are bombs, then (6,5) would have two bombs adjacent, which matches the 2. Also, (6,6) is 2. Let's check (6,6). The adjacent cells include (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is '.', (5,7) is '.', (6,5) is 2, (6,7) is '.', (7,5) is 1, (7,6) is '.', (7,7) is '.'. The number is 2, so two bombs here. If (5,6) and (7,6) are bombs, then (6,6) would have those two bombs adjacent. That works. So (5,6) and (7,6) must be bombs. But we have 9 flags remaining and 10 bombs. Since there's already one flag at (4,3), we need to place 9 more flags. But if we place flags here, that would account for two bombs, leaving 7 more. But let's check if this is possible.\n\nWait, but according to the rules, if a number's adjacent flags already equal the number, then the remaining adjacent cells are safe. So in (6,5) which is 2, if we flag (5,6) and (7,6), then those two flags would satisfy the 2. Then the other adjacent cells (like (5,4), (5,5), etc.) are safe. But how do we know that (5,6) and (7,6) are bombs? Let's see. The cell (6,5) is 2. The only adjacent unexplored cells are (5,6) and (7,6). So those must be the two bombs. Therefore, we can flag both (5,6) and (7,6). But we have 9 flags remaining. Since there's already one flag, we can place 9 more. But each flag placed here would use two of them. Wait, but the current flags remaining is 9. The game info says flags remaining:9. So the total flags placed so far is 1 (at 4,3). So we can place 9 more. So placing flags at (5,6) and (7,6) would use two flags, leaving 7. But how do we know that those are bombs?\n\nYes, because (6,5) is 2, and the only adjacent unexplored cells are (5,6) and (7,6). So those must be the bombs. Therefore, those two cells should be flagged. Let's check if there's any conflict with other numbers.\n\nFor example, (5,5) is 1. The adjacent cells include (5,6). If we flag (5,6), then (5,5)'s 1 is satisfied. So that's okay. Similarly, (7,5) is 1. The adjacent cells include (7,6). If we flag (7,6), then (7,5)'s 1 is satisfied. So that's okay. So placing flags at (5,6) and (7,6) seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the cell (6,6) is 2. If we flag (5,6) and (7,6), then (6,6) would have two bombs adjacent, which matches its number. So that's correct. So these two flags are valid.\n\nSo the next move would be to place a flag at (5,6) or (7,6). Let's check which one is possible. Let's look at the board state for (5,6). Row 5, column 6 is '.' (unexplored). So we can place a flag there. Similarly, (7,6) is '.'.\n\nBut according to the rules, we need to check if placing a flag here conflicts with other numbers. For example, placing a flag at (5,6) would affect (5,5) which is 1. Since (5,5) is 1, and (5,6) is adjacent, that would account for the 1. So that's okay. Similarly, (6,5) is 2, and (5,6) is adjacent. So placing a flag there is correct.\n\nSo the next move could be to place a flag at (5,6). Let's check if there's any other obvious flags to place.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 7 is 3. The adjacent unexplored cells are (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). But that's a lot of cells. Maybe after placing the two flags in (5,6) and (7,6), we can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another spot. Let's check row 4, column 7 is 2. The adjacent unexplored cells are (3,8), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). But we already considered (5,6) as a bomb. If (5,6) is a bomb, then (4,7)'s 2 would have one bomb (from (5,6)), so there must be another bomb in the remaining cells. But (4,7) is 2, so after placing a flag at (5,6), there's still one more bomb needed. The other adjacent unexplored cells are (3,8), (4,8), (5,7), (5,8). So one of those must be a bomb. But without more info, it's hard to tell. So maybe we should focus on the definite bombs first.\n\nSo the definite bombs are (5,6) and (7,6). Placing flags there would use two flags, leaving 7 remaining. But since the total bombs are 10, and we have 9 flags left, but we need to flag 10 bombs, but the flags remaining is 9. Wait, the game info says flags remaining:9, bombs:10. So there's a discrepancy here. Because the total bombs are 10, but flags remaining is 9. That suggests that one bomb is already flagged (the F at (4,3)), so total flags needed are 10. But the flags remaining is 9, which would mean that one more flag is needed. Wait, the flags remaining is 9, which is the number of flags left to place. So the total flags placed so far is 1 (at 4,3). So we need to place 9 more flags to mark all 10 bombs. But the total bombs are 10, so we need to place 10 flags. But currently, we have 1 flag placed, and 9 remaining. So 1 + 9 = 10, which matches the bombs. So that's correct.\n\nSo placing flags at (5,6) and (7,6) would use two flags, leaving 7. But each of those flags would account for a bomb. So after placing those two, we have 8 bombs left to flag. But according to the game info, we have 9 flags remaining. Wait, no. The flags remaining is 9, which is the number of flags we can still place. So after placing two flags, flags remaining would be 7. But the total bombs are 10, so we need to place 10 flags. So 1 (existing) + 9 (remaining) = 10. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo placing flags at (5,6) and (7,6) is valid. But since each move is one action, we can only do one at a time. So which one to choose first?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another cell that is a definite bomb. Let's check row 6, column 6 is 2. The adjacent cells include (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). We already considered (5,6) and (7,6) as bombs. So (6,6) is 2, which would be satisfied by those two flags. So that's correct.\n\nAnother possible spot: row 8, column 7 is 3. If we can find three bombs around it. But that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, column 7 is 2. If we have already placed a flag at (5,6), then (4,7) would have one bomb accounted for. So there's another bomb needed in (3,8), (4,8), (5,7), (5,8). But without more info, we can't determine which.\n\nAlternatively, let's check row 7, column 5 is 1. The adjacent cells are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (6,4) is '_', (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2, (7,4) is '_', (7,6) is '.' (which we considered as a bomb), (8,4) is '_', (8,5) is 1, (8,6) is 1. So the only unexplored cell adjacent to (7,5) is (7,6). If (7,6) is a bomb, then (7,5)'s 1 is satisfied. So that's correct.\n\nSo placing a flag at (7,6) would satisfy both (6,5) and (7,5). So that's a good move.\n\nSimilarly, placing a flag at (5,6) would satisfy (6,5) and (5,5). So both are valid.\n\nSo which one to choose first? Let's pick (5,6) first. Let's check if there's any conflict.\n\nWait, (5,6) is adjacent to (5,5) which is 1. Placing a flag there would satisfy that 1. Also, (6,5) is 2, so placing a flag at (5,6) would account for one of the two bombs needed. Then we need another bomb at (7,6). So placing both flags is necessary.\n\nBut since each move is one action, the first move would be to place a flag at (5,6). Then, after that, the next move would be (7,6). But the current problem is to provide the next move.\n\nSo the next move should be to place a flag at (5,6). Let's confirm.\n\nYes, because (6,5) is 2, and the only adjacent unexplored cells are (5,6) and (7,6). Therefore, both must be bombs. So placing a flag at (5,6) is correct.\n\nAnother check: after placing the flag at (5,6), the cell (5,5) which is 1 would have that flag as adjacent, so no other bombs can be adjacent. The other adjacent cells to (5,5) are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (5,6) is flagged, (4,4) is 1, (4,5) is 1, (4,6) is 1, (5,4) is 1, (6,4) is '_', (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2. So all other cells are either revealed or numbers. So no conflict.\n\nTherefore, placing a flag at (5,6) is safe and correct.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (6,5) is a 2 with only two adjacent unexplored cells (5,6 and 7,6). These must both be bombs. Placing a flag at (5,6) satisfies the 2 and the adjacent 1 at (5,5).\n\nMOVE: 5,6,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 2 . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n3 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n4 _ _ 1 F 1 1 1 2 . .\n5 _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 2 2 . . .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n8 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 3 . .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 7, "y": 5, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next move, either placing a flag or revealing a square. Let's start by analyzing the current state of the board and the given information.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 8 flags remaining. So, there are already some flags placed, and we need to make sure they are correct. Let's check the existing flags against the numbers to see if there are any conflicts.\n\nLooking at the board, the flags are at positions (4,3) and (5,6). Let's verify if these make sense. \n\nStarting with the flag at (4,3). The cell at (4,4) is a 1. The 1 at (4,4) should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent cells include (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). The flag at (4,3) is adjacent to (4,4). So that's one bomb. Are there any other possible bombs around (4,4)? Let's check the other cells. The cell (5,3) is a 1, but that's part of another number. Wait, maybe I should check each numbered cell around the flags.\n\nWait, the cell (4,3) is flagged. Let's check the cells that have numbers adjacent to it. For example, the cell (3,3) is a 1. The 1 at (3,3) should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent cells include (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). The flag at (4,3) is one of those. So that's the one bomb for (3,3). That seems okay. Then, the cell (4,4) is a 1. As mentioned earlier, the flag at (4,3) is adjacent. So that's the one bomb for (4,4). So that's correct.\n\nNow, the flag at (5,6). Let's check the numbers around it. The cell (5,5) is a 1. The adjacent cells to (5,5) include (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). The flag at (5,6) is adjacent. So the 1 at (5,5) would have that as the only bomb. That's correct. Also, the cell (6,5) is a 2. Let's check adjacent flags. The cells around (6,5) include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). The flag at (5,6) is adjacent. So the 2 at (6,5) has one flag so far. There should be another bomb adjacent. But where? Let's see. The other cells around (6,5) are mostly unexplored. For example, (5,4) is a 1, (5,5) is a 1, (6,4) is a 2, (6,6) is a 2, (7,4) is a 1, (7,5) is a ., (7,6) is a 3. Wait, maybe the 2 at (6,5) requires another bomb. But since there's already one flag (5,6), there must be another bomb in the adjacent cells. However, the other cells around (6,5) are either numbers or unexplored. So maybe the 2 at (6,5) is satisfied by the flag at (5,6) and another bomb in an unexplored cell. But how does that affect our current analysis?\n\nWait, perhaps we need to check if existing flags are conflicting with any numbers. Let's check each numbered cell to see if the number of adjacent flags exceeds the number. For example, the cell (4,7) is a 2. Let's check adjacent cells. The cells around (4,7) are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). The flag at (5,6) is adjacent. So the 2 at (4,7) has one flag. Are there any other flags? The cell (5,6) is the only one. So the 2 at (4,7) needs one more bomb. But the other cells around it are (3,6) is a 1, (3,7) is a 1, (3,8) is ., (4,6) is 1, (4,8) is ., (5,7) is ., (5,8) is .. So maybe there's another bomb in those unexplored cells. But that's okay; the 2 is not conflicting yet.\n\nNow, let's look for cells where the number of adjacent flags equals the number. For example, the cell (5,5) is a 1, and it has a flag at (5,6). So that's exactly one, which is correct. The cell (3,3) is a 1 with a flag at (4,3), which is correct. The cell (4,4) is a 1 with the same flag. So those are okay.\n\nNext, look for cells where the number of adjacent flags is less than the number, and the remaining adjacent cells must be bombs. For example, the cell (6,5) is a 2 with one flag. So there must be another bomb in the adjacent cells. Let's check the adjacent cells. The cells around (6,5) are (5,4) which is a 1, (5,5) which is a 1, (5,6) which is a flag, (6,4) which is a 2, (6,6) which is a 2, (7,4) which is a 1, (7,5) which is unexplored (.), (7,6) which is a 3. So the remaining possible bombs could be in (7,5) or (5,4), but (5,4) is a 1. Wait, (5,4) is a 1. Let's check if (5,4) has any flags. The adjacent cells to (5,4) include (4,3) which is a flag, (4,4) which is 1, (4,5) which is 1, (5,3) which is 1, (5,5) which is 1, (6,3) which is ., (6,4) which is 2, (6,5) which is 2. The flag at (4,3) is adjacent to (5,4). So the 1 at (5,4) has one bomb already (the flag at (4,3)), so there can't be any other bombs around it. Therefore, the cell (5,4) is satisfied. So the remaining cells around (6,5) that could have a bomb are (7,5) and maybe (5,6) is already flagged. Wait, (5,6) is already a flag, so that's accounted for. So the 2 at (6,5) needs another bomb. The only possible cell is (7,5), which is unexplored. So perhaps (7,5) is a bomb. But how do we know? Maybe we can look for other clues.\n\nLooking at the cell (7,6) which is a 3. Let's check adjacent cells. The cells around (7,6) are (6,5) which is 2, (6,6) which is 2, (6,7) which is ., (7,5) which is ., (7,7) which is ., (8,5) which is 1, (8,6) which is 3, (8,7) which is .. The 3 at (7,6) needs three bombs. Let's see if there are any flags around. The cell (6,5) is a 2 with one flag. The cell (6,6) is a 2. The cell (8,6) is a 3. Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe this is a more complex area.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells where the number of adjacent unexplored cells plus existing flags equals the number. For example, the cell (8,6) is a 3. Let's check adjacent cells. The cells around (8,6) are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). The cell (8,5) is a 1, (8,7) is ., (9,5) is ., (9,6) is ., (9,7) is 1. So the 3 at (8,6) has three bombs needed. The adjacent unexplored cells are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6). But this might be too vague. Let's look for a more straightforward case.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 6 (5,6) is a flag. The cell (5,5) is a 1, which is satisfied by that flag. Now, the cell (5,7) is unexplored. Let's see if there's a way to determine if that's safe. The cell (4,7) is a 2. The adjacent cells to (4,7) include (5,6) which is a flag, (5,7) which is ., and others. So the 2 at (4,7) has one flag, so needs one more bomb. The possible cells are (5,7) or (3,6), (3,7), etc. But (3,6) is a 1. Let's check (3,6). The cell (3,6) is a 1. Its adjacent cells include (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). The cell (4,7) is a 2. The cell (3,5) is a 1. The cell (4,5) is a 1. So the 1 at (3,6) must have exactly one bomb. The adjacent cells include (4,7) which is a 2. But how does that help? Maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the cell (6,6) which is a 2. The adjacent cells include (5,5) which is a 1, (5,6) which is a flag, (5,7) which is ., (6,5) which is 2, (6,7) which is ., (7,5) which is ., (7,6) which is 3, (7,7) which is .. So the 2 at (6,6) has one flag (5,6), so needs another bomb. The possible cells are (5,7), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). But (7,6) is a 3, which might have its own bombs. This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better spot to analyze.\n\nLooking at the cell (4,7) which is a 2. Adjacent cells include (5,6) which is a flag, so one bomb. The other cells are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,7), (5,8). The cell (3,6) is a 1, (3,7) is a 1, (4,6) is a 1. So the remaining possible bombs are in (3,8), (4,8), (5,7), (5,8). But how many bombs are needed here? The 2 at (4,7) needs one more bomb. Let's see if any of those cells are already accounted for by other numbers. For example, (3,7) is a 1. The adjacent cells to (3,7) include (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). The cell (4,7) is a 2. The 1 at (3,7) must have exactly one bomb. If (4,7) has a bomb in (5,7), then that would affect (3,7). Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe we need to look for a cell that can be safely revealed.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells where the number of adjacent unexplored cells equals the number of remaining bombs needed. For example, a cell with a 1 that has one unexplored cell adjacent and no flags. Then that unexplored cell must be a bomb. Let's check for such cases.\n\nLooking at the cell (3,2) which is a 1. Wait, (3,2) is a 1. Let's check adjacent cells. The cells around (3,2) are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). The cell (4,3) is a flag. So the 1 at (3,2) has one bomb (the flag at (4,3)), so all other adjacent cells must be safe. So the cells (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2) can be revealed. But looking at the board, (3,3) is a 1, which is already revealed. The cells (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) are unexplored (.)? Wait, looking at the board state:\n\nRow 3: _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\nSo row 3, columns 0-9: positions (3,0) is _, (3,1) is _, (3,2) is 1, (3,3) is 1, (3,4) is 1, (3,5) is _, (3,6) is _, (3,7) is 1, (3,8) is ., (3,9) is . So (3,1) is _, which is revealed empty. So the adjacent cells to (3,2) (which is 1) are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). The cell (4,3) is a flag. The cells (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) are unexplored? Wait, looking at row 2: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . So row 2, columns 0-9: (2,0) is _, (2,1) is _, (2,2) is _, (2,3) is _, (2,4) is _, (2,5) is _, (2,6) is _, (2,7) is 1, (2,8) is ., (2,9) is . So (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are all _, which are revealed empty. So the adjacent cells to (3,2) that are unexplored would be (4,1) and (4,2). Let's check row 4: _ _ 1 F 1 1 1 2 . . So row 4, columns 0-9: (4,0) is _, (4,1) is _, (4,2) is 1, (4,3) is F, (4,4) is 1, (4,5) is 1, (4,6) is 1, (4,7) is 2, (4,8) is ., (4,9) is . So (4,1) is _, which is revealed empty. (4,2) is 1. So all adjacent cells to (3,2) are either revealed or flagged. Therefore, the 1 at (3,2) is satisfied by the flag at (4,3). So no action needed here.\n\nAnother cell to check: (5,3) is a 1. Adjacent cells include (4,2) which is 1, (4,3) which is F, (4,4) which is 1, (5,2) which is ., (5,4) which is 1, (6,2) which is ., (6,3) which is ., (6,4) which is 2. The flag at (4,3) is adjacent. So the 1 at (5,3) has one bomb (the flag), so all other adjacent cells are safe. Therefore, (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) can be revealed. But (6,4) is a 2, which is already revealed. So (5,2), (6,2), (6,3) are unexplored. Let's check the board. Row 5: _ _ 1 1 1 1 F . . . So (5,0) and (5,1) are _, (5,2) is 1, (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is F, (5,7) is ., etc. Wait, no. Wait, row 5 is: _ _ 1 1 1 1 F . . . So (5,0) is _, (5,1) is _, (5,2) is 1, (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is F, (5,7) is ., (5,8) is ., (5,9) is .. So (5,2) is 1, which is already revealed. So the adjacent cells to (5,3) that are unexplored are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). But (6,4) is a 2. So (6,2) and (6,3) are unexplored. Since the 1 at (5,3) is satisfied by the flag at (4,3), those cells (6,2) and (6,3) must be safe. So we can reveal them. Let's check if they are unexplored. Looking at row 6: _ _ _ _ _ 2 2 . . . So (6,0) is _, (6,1) is _, (6,2) is _, (6,3) is _, (6,4) is _, (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2, (6,7) is ., (6,8) is ., (6,9) is .. Wait, no. Wait, row 6 is: _ _ _ _ _ 2 2 . . . So (6,0) to (6,4) are all _, which are revealed empty. (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2, and the rest are .. So (6,2) and (6,3) are already revealed as empty. So maybe I made a mistake here. The cell (5,3) is adjacent to (6,2) and (6,3), but those are already revealed as empty. So no action needed here.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look elsewhere. Let's check the cell (7,5) which is unexplored. The cell (6,5) is a 2 with one adjacent flag (5,6). So there must be another bomb adjacent. The possible cells are (7,5), (5,7), (6,6), etc. But (6,6) is a 2. Let's see if there's a way to determine if (7,5) is a bomb. The cell (7,5) is adjacent to (6,5) (which is 2), (7,4) (which is 1), (7,6) (which is 3), (8,5) (which is 1), and others. Let's check the cell (7,4) which is a 1. The adjacent cells to (7,4) include (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). The cell (6,5) is a 2, (6,4) is a 2, (8,5) is a 1. The 1 at (7,4) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The possible bombs could be in (6,5) (but that's a 2, which already has a flag?), or (7,5), or others. Wait, (6,5) is a 2, which has one flag (5,6). So the 2 at (6,5) needs another bomb. If (7,5) is a bomb, then that would satisfy both the 2 at (6,5) and the 1 at (7,4). Let's see: if (7,5) is a bomb, then the 1 at (7,4) would have one bomb (7,5), which is correct. The 2 at (6,5) would have the flag at (5,6) and the bomb at (7,5), totaling two, which is correct. The cell (7,6) is a 3. If (7,5) is a bomb, then the 3 at (7,6) would have that bomb plus others. Let's check adjacent cells to (7,6): (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2, (6,7) is ., (7,5) is ., (7,7) is ., (8,5) is 1, (8,6) is 3, (8,7) is .. If (7,5) is a bomb, then the 3 at (7,6) would need two more bombs. But this is getting complicated. However, the key point is that the 1 at (7,4) must have exactly one bomb. If (7,5) is a bomb, that's satisfied. If not, then where else could the bomb be? The other adjacent cells to (7,4) are (6,3), (6,4), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). (6,3) is unexplored? Wait, row 6: _ _ _ _ _ 2 2 . . . So (6,3) is _, which is revealed empty. So (6,3) is safe. (6,4) is a 2. (7,3) is unexplored. (8,3) is unexplored. (8,4) is unexplored. (8,5) is a 1. So the only possible bomb for (7,4) is (7,5). Therefore, (7,5) must be a bomb. But wait, the cell (7,5) is unexplored. So we can place a flag there. But we have 8 flags remaining, and there are 10 bombs total, with 2 already flagged. So 8 flags left, but the total bombs are 10. Wait, the GAME INFO says Flags remaining: 8, Bombs: 10. So there are 10 bombs, and currently 2 flags placed. So 8 flags remaining. So placing a flag here would use one of them. But according to the analysis, (7,5) must be a bomb. So we can flag (7,5). But we need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nWait, let's confirm. The cell (7,4) is a 1. If we flag (7,5), then the 1 at (7,4) is satisfied. The cell (6,5) is a 2 with one existing flag (5,6) and the new flag at (7,5), totaling two, which satisfies the 2. The cell (7,6) is a 3. Adjacent cells would then have two bombs (5,6) and (7,5), but (7,6) is a 3, so it needs one more bomb. But that's possible elsewhere. So flagging (7,5) seems correct. But we need to check if there's any conflict. For example, the cell (8,5) is a 1. Adjacent cells include (7,4) which is 1, (7,5) which would be flagged, (7,6) which is 3, (8,4) which is ., (8,6) which is 3, (9,4) which is ., (9,5) which is ., (9,6) which is .. The 1 at (8,5) would have the flag at (7,5) as adjacent, which would make it have one bomb. That's correct. So flagging (7,5) seems safe.\n\nAnother possible move is to reveal a cell that is definitely safe. For example, the cell (5,7) is unexplored. Let's see if we can determine its safety. The cell (4,7) is a 2 with one flag (5,6). So it needs another bomb. The possible cells are (5,7), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,8). The cell (3,6) is a 1, which must have exactly one bomb. The adjacent cells to (3,6) include (4,7) which is a 2. If (3,6) has a bomb, then the 1 at (3,6) would be satisfied. But (3,6) is a 1, so it must have exactly one bomb. Let's check the adjacent cells to (3,6): (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). The cell (4,7) is a 2. The cell (3,5) is a 1. The cell (4,5) is a 1. The cell (3,7) is a 1. So the 1 at (3,6) must have exactly one bomb. If the bomb is in (4,7), but (4,7) is a 2, which already has one flag (5,6). So the 2 at (4,7) needs another bomb. If (3,6) has a bomb, then the 1 at (3,6) is satisfied. But the 2 at (4,7) would have that bomb plus the flag at (5,6), totaling two. That works. So (3,6) could be a bomb. But how do we know? This is getting too complex. Maybe there's a safer move.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the cell (8,8) which is a 3. Let's check adjacent cells. But this might not be helpful. Let's think of another approach.\n\nWait, the cell (5,6) is flagged. The cell (5,5) is a 1, which is satisfied by that flag. The cell (5,7) is unexplored. The cell (5,6) is a flag, so the cell (5,7) could be a bomb if needed. But the cell (4,7) is a 2 needing another bomb. If (5,7) is a bomb, then the 2 at (4,7) is satisfied. But how does that affect other cells? For example, the cell (5,7) is adjacent to (4,7) and (6,7). The cell (6,7) is unexplored. If (5,7) is a bomb, then the cell (6,7) would be adjacent to a bomb, but we don't have information about that yet. This is getting too speculative.\n\nBack to the earlier analysis: the cell (7,5) must be a bomb because the 1 at (7,4) requires it. Therefore, placing a flag at (7,5) is the correct move. Let's check if there are any conflicts. The cell (7,5) is adjacent to (7,4) (1), (7,6) (3), (6,5) (2), (8,5) (1). Placing a flag here would satisfy the 1 at (7,4) and the 2 at (6,5). The 3 at (7,6) would then need two more bombs. But that's possible. So no conflict here. Also, the cell (8,5) is a 1, which would have the flag at (7,5) as adjacent, satisfying its count. So this seems safe.\n\nAnother possible move is to reveal (7,5), but that's risky if it's a bomb. But according to the analysis, it should be a bomb, so revealing it would lose the game. Therefore, the correct move is to flag (7,5).\n\nWait, but the user's rules say that before placing a new flag, we must verify that it doesn't conflict with existing numbers. So placing a flag at (7,5) would satisfy the 1 at (7,4), the 2 at (6,5), and the 1 at (8,5). Let's check all those numbers again. The 1 at (7,4) would have exactly one bomb (7,5). The 2 at (6,5) would have two bombs (5,6 and 7,5). The 1 at (8,5) would have one bomb (7,5). All of these are correct. So no conflicts. Therefore, placing a flag at (7,5) is valid.\n\nAnother check: the total flags remaining is 8. Currently, there are two flags (4,3 and 5,6). Placing a third would leave 7 flags remaining. Since there are 10 bombs, we need to place 10 flags. So this is okay.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be to place a flag at (7,5).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (7,4) is a 1, which must have exactly one adjacent bomb. The only possible location for this bomb is the unexplored cell (7,5). Additionally, the cell (6,5) is a 2 with one adjacent flag (5,6), requiring another bomb at (7,5). Placing a flag here satisfies both conditions without conflicts.\n\nMOVE: 7,5,true", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 2 . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n3 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n4 _ _ 1 F 1 1 1 2 . .\n5 _ _ 1 1 1 1 F . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 2 2 . . .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n8 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 3 . .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 6, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next safe move. First, I need to check all the revealed numbers and existing flags to see if there are any conflicts or obvious places to flag or reveal.\n\nStarting with the game info: there are 10 bombs and 7 flags remaining. So, 7 flags have already been placed. Let me scan the board for existing flags.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 3 is flagged (F). Then in row 5, column 6 is another F. And row 7, column 5 is an F. Wait, let me check each row:\n\nRow 4: (4,3) is F.\nRow 5: (5,6) is F.\nRow 7: (7,5) is F.\nAre there others? Let me check again. The board state shows:\n\nRow 4: ... F ...\nRow 5: ... F ...\nRow 7: ... F ...\nHmm, maybe those are the only three flags. Wait, the flags remaining are 7, so there should be 10 bombs minus the flags placed. Wait, the game info says Flags remaining:7, so total flags placed would be 10 -7=3? Wait no, the flags remaining is the number of flags left to place. Wait, the total bombs are 10. So the user has placed some flags, and the remaining flags they can place is 7. Wait, no. Wait, the flags remaining is the number of flags the player has left to place. So if there are 10 bombs, and the player has placed 3 flags (since 7 remain), but maybe some of those flags are correct or incorrect. But according to the rules, each flag should mark a bomb, but if the player placed a flag incorrectly, that's a problem. But the analysis steps say to check for conflicts.\n\nSo first, check existing flags against the numbers. Let's look at each number and see if the adjacent flags make sense.\n\nStarting with row 4, column 3 (F). Let's check the adjacent numbers. The cell at (4,3) is flagged. Let's look around it. The cell (4,2) is 1, (4,4) is 1. Also, (3,2) is 1, (3,3) is 1, (3,4) is 1. Let's see if the flags around these numbers make sense.\n\nTake the cell (4,2) which is a 1. The adjacent cells include (4,3) which is flagged. So that 1 should have exactly one bomb. Since there's already a flag next to it, the other adjacent cells should be safe. Let's check the adjacent cells of (4,2). The cells around (4,2) are:\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3),\n(4,1),        (4,3),\n(5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n\nBut (4,3) is flagged. So the 1 at (4,2) is satisfied by that flag. Therefore, all other adjacent cells should be safe. So (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) should be safe. But looking at the board, some of these might be unexplored. For example, (3,1) is in row 3, column 1. Let's check row 3:\n\nRow 3: _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . \n\nSo columns 0 and 1 are '_', which are empty revealed. Wait, no. Wait, row 3's columns 0 and 1 are '_', which are empty. So (3,1) is '_', which is already revealed. So that's safe. Similarly, (4,1) is '_', which is revealed. So the 1 at (4,2) is okay.\n\nNow, looking at the cell (4,4) which is 1. The adjacent cells include (4,3) (flagged), so that 1's count is satisfied. Therefore, the other adjacent cells should be safe. Let's check the adjacent cells of (4,4):\n\n(3,3), (3,4), (3,5),\n(4,3),        (4,5),\n(5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\n(4,3) is flagged, so the 1 at (4,4) is covered. So the other cells around (4,4) should be safe. For example, (3,5) is '_', which is revealed. (4,5) is 1. (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1. So those are all numbers. So maybe the unexplored cells around (4,4) are already covered.\n\nNext, check the cell (5,6) which is F. Let's see the numbers around it. The cell (5,6) is flagged. Let's look at adjacent numbers. For example, (5,5) is 1, (5,7) is '.' (unexplored). Also, (4,5) is 1, (4,6) is 1, (4,7) is 2. (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2. Let's check if the flag at (5,6) is conflicting with any numbers.\n\nTake the cell (5,5) which is 1. The adjacent cells include (5,6) (flagged). So the 1 at (5,5) should have exactly one bomb. Since (5,6) is flagged, that's the bomb. So the other cells around (5,5) should be safe. Let's check the adjacent cells of (5,5):\n\n(4,4), (4,5), (4,6),\n(5,4),        (5,6),\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\n(5,6) is flagged, so the 1 is satisfied. The other cells like (4,6) is 1, (6,5) is 2. So those are numbers. The cell (4,6) is 1. Let's check if that 1 is satisfied. The adjacent cells to (4,6) (which is 1) include (4,5) (1), (4,7) (2), (5,5) (1), (5,6) (F), (5,7) (.), (3,5) (_), (3,6) (_), (3,7) (1). Wait, (4,6) is 1. The adjacent cells would be:\n\n(3,5), (3,6), (3,7),\n(4,5),        (4,7),\n(5,5), (5,6), (5,7).\n\nSo (5,6) is flagged. So the 1 at (4,6) is satisfied by that flag. Therefore, the other cells around (4,6) should be safe. For example, (3,5) is '_', (3,6) is '_', (3,7) is 1, (4,5) is 1, (4,7) is 2, (5,5) is 1, (5,7) is '.'.\n\nSo (5,7) is unexplored. Since (4,6) is 1 and adjacent to (5,6) (F), then (5,7) should be safe. But (5,7) is '.' so maybe we can reveal it. Wait, but let's check if there's any other numbers that might affect that.\n\nLooking at (4,7) which is 2. The adjacent cells include (5,6) (F), so that's one bomb. So there should be one more bomb adjacent to (4,7). Let's check the adjacent cells of (4,7):\n\n(3,6), (3,7), (3,8),\n(4,6),        (4,8),\n(5,6), (5,7), (5,8).\n\n(5,6) is F (counted as 1). So there's one more bomb needed. The other cells around (4,7) are (3,6) is '_', (3,7) is 1, (3,8) is '.', (4,6) is 1, (4,8) is '.', (5,7) is '.', (5,8) is '.'.\n\nSo the remaining bomb could be in any of the '.' cells adjacent to (4,7). But since (4,7) is 2 and already has one flag, there must be exactly one more bomb. So among (3,6), (3,8), (4,8), (5,7), (5,8), one of them is a bomb. But how do we determine which?\n\nHmm. Let's check other numbers that might influence this. For example, (3,7) is 1. The adjacent cells to (3,7) are:\n\n(2,6), (2,7), (2,8),\n(3,6),        (3,8),\n(4,6), (4,7), (4,8).\n\n(3,7) is 1. The adjacent cells include (4,7) which is 2. But (3,7)'s count is 1. So there must be exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. Let's see which cells are unexplored. (2,6), (2,7), (2,8) are '.' (unexplored). (3,6) is '_', (3,8) is '.', (4,6) is 1, (4,7) is 2, (4,8) is '.'.\n\nSo the unexplored cells around (3,7) are (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8). The 1 at (3,7) requires exactly one bomb among these. But (4,7) is 2 and already has one flag (from (5,6)), so the remaining bomb for (4,7) must be in one of the cells adjacent to both (3,7) and (4,7). That is, (3,8) or (4,8) or (5,7) or (5,8). Wait, but (3,7)'s adjacent cells include (4,7), but (4,7) is a 2. So the bomb for (3,7) could be in (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8). But (4,7) needs another bomb in its adjacent cells. So perhaps there's overlap here. For example, if (3,8) is a bomb, that would satisfy both (3,7)'s 1 and (4,7)'s 2. But how?\n\nWait, (3,7) is 1. If (3,8) is a bomb, then (3,7) would have one bomb. Then (4,7) would have (5,6) and (3,8) as bombs, making 2, which matches. So that's possible. Alternatively, if (4,8) is a bomb, then (4,7) would have (5,6) and (4,8) as bombs. But (3,7) would then have (4,8) as a bomb, which is adjacent. So (3,7) would have one bomb (from (4,8)), which is okay. But then (3,7)'s other adjacent cells would need to have no other bombs. So that's possible. But how do we know which one is correct?\n\nThis seems a bit complex. Let's look for other areas where we can make progress.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 6 (F). The cell (5,6) is flagged. Let's check adjacent numbers. For example, (5,5) is 1, (5,7) is '.' (unexplored). (4,5) is 1, (4,6) is 1, (4,7) is 2. (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2. Let's see if the flag here is correct.\n\nThe cell (5,5) is 1. It has (5,6) as a flag, so that's the bomb. So the other adjacent cells to (5,5) should be safe. For example, (4,5) is 1, which is already revealed. (6,5) is 2. Let's check (6,5) which is 2. The adjacent cells include (5,5) (1), (5,6) (F), (6,6) (2), (7,5) (F), etc. Wait, (7,5) is another F. Let's check that.\n\nThe cell (7,5) is flagged. Let's look at adjacent numbers. (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2, (7,4) is '_', (7,6) is '.' (unexplored), (8,4) is '_', (8,5) is 1, (8,6) is 3. So (7,5) is F. Let's check if this flag is conflicting with any numbers.\n\nTake (6,5) which is 2. The adjacent cells include (5,5) (1), (5,6) (F), (6,6) (2), (7,5) (F), (7,6) (.), (5,4) (1), (7,4) (_), (6,4) (which is in row 6, column 4: looking at row 6, it's '_ _ _ _ _ 2 2 . . .', so column 4 is '_', which is revealed. So (6,4) is '_', safe. So (6,5) is 2. The adjacent flags are (5,6) and (7,5). Wait, that's two flags. But (6,5) is 2. So that's correct. So the two flags adjacent to (6,5) account for the two bombs. Therefore, the other adjacent cells should be safe. For example, (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (6,6) is 2, (7,6) is '.'.\n\nSo (7,6) is '.' and adjacent to (6,5) (2) which already has two flags. So (7,6) should be safe. But (7,6) is unexplored. So maybe we can reveal that. But wait, let's check other numbers that might affect this.\n\nLooking at (8,6) which is 3. The adjacent cells include (7,5) (F), (7,6) (.), (7,7) (.), (8,5) (1), (8,7) (.), (9,5) (.), (9,6) (.), (9,7) (1). So (8,6) is 3. The adjacent flags are (7,5) (F). So there are three bombs needed. One is already flagged at (7,5). So two more bombs must be in the adjacent cells. But (7,6), (7,7), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) are unexplored. This seems complicated. Maybe we can look for a safer spot.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 5 is 1. The adjacent cells include (7,5) (F), so that's one bomb. So the other cells around (8,5) should be safe. Let's check the adjacent cells of (8,5):\n\n(7,4), (7,5), (7,6),\n(8,4),        (8,6),\n(9,4), (9,5), (9,6).\n\n(7,5) is F. So the 1 at (8,5) is satisfied. Therefore, the other cells should be safe. So (7,4) is '_', (7,6) is '.', (8,4) is '_', (8,6) is 3, (9,4) is '_', (9,5) is '.', (9,6) is '.'.\n\nSo (9,5) and (9,6) are unexplored. Since (8,5) is 1 and adjacent to (7,5) (F), those cells should be safe. So (9,5) and (9,6) can be revealed. But (9,5) is in row 9, column 5. Let's check row 9:\n\nRow 9: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nSo columns 0-4 are '_', column 5 is '_', column 6 is '_', column 7 is 1, and 8-9 are '.'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, row 9 is:\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nSo columns 0-6 are '_', column 7 is 1, and 8-9 are '.'.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck. The given board state for row 9 is:\n\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nSo columns 0-6 are '_', column 7 is 1, columns 8-9 are '.'.\n\nSo (9,5) is in column 5 of row 9, which is '_', already revealed. Wait, no. Wait, row 9's columns are 0-9. The given row 9 is:\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nSo columns 0-6 are '_', column 7 is 1, columns 8-9 are '.'.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because the board is 10x10. So row 9 has columns 0-9. The given row 9 is:\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nSo columns 0-6 are '_', column 7 is 1, column 8 is '.', column 9 is '.'.\n\nSo (9,5) is column 5 of row 9, which is '_', already revealed. So (9,5) is safe. Then (9,6) is column 6 of row 9, which is '_', also revealed. So maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the cell (8,5) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (9,5) and (9,6). But according to row 9, (9,5) is '_', which is already revealed. So (9,5) is safe. Then (9,6) is also '_', so safe. So perhaps the unexplored cells around (8,5) are (7,6) and (8,6). (8,6) is 3, which is a number. So (7,6) is '.' and should be safe. So maybe we can reveal (7,6).\n\nBut wait, (7,6) is adjacent to (8,6) which is 3. Let's check if revealing (7,6) is safe. Since (8,5) is 1 and adjacent to (7,5) (F), the other cells around (8,5) are safe. So (7,6) is adjacent to (8,5) and (8,6). But (8,5) is 1, which is satisfied by (7,5). So (7,6) is safe. Therefore, we can reveal (7,6).\n\nAlternatively, looking at (6,5) which is 2 with two adjacent flags (5,6 and 7,5). So the remaining cells around (6,5) should be safe. For example, (7,6) is '.' and adjacent to (6,5). So (7,6) should be safe. So revealing (7,6) would be a good move.\n\nBut let's check other areas. Let's look at row 5, column 6 (F). The cell (5,6) is flagged. Let's check the cell (5,7) which is '.' and adjacent to (5,6). Since (5,5) is 1 and adjacent to (5,6) (F), the other cells around (5,5) should be safe. So (5,7) is adjacent to (5,6) and (4,7) (2). But (5,7) is '.' and could be safe. But since (4,7) is 2 and needs another bomb, maybe (5,7) is a bomb. But how do we know?\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, column 5 (F). The cell (7,5) is flagged. Let's check adjacent numbers. (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2, (7,6) is '.' (unexplored), (8,5) is 1, (8,6) is 3. The cell (8,6) is 3. The adjacent flags are (7,5) (F). So there are three bombs needed. One is already flagged. So two more bombs must be in the adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (8,6) are:\n\n(7,5) (F), (7,6) (.), (7,7) (.), (8,5) (1), (8,7) (.), (9,5) (.), (9,6) (.), (9,7) (1).\n\nBut (9,5) and (9,6) are '.' in row 9, but according to row 9's state, columns 0-6 are '_', so (9,5) and (9,6) are '_' (already revealed). Wait, no. Wait, row 9's state is:\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nSo columns 0-6 are '_', column 7 is 1, columns 8-9 are '.'.\n\nSo (9,5) is column 5 of row 9, which is '_', already revealed. (9,6) is column 6 of row 9, which is '_', also revealed. So (9,5) and (9,6) are safe. Therefore, the remaining bombs for (8,6) must be in (7,6), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7). But (9,7) is 1. Let's check (9,7) which is 1. The adjacent cells include (8,6) (3), (8,7) (.), (9,6) ('_'), (9,8) (.), etc. So (9,7) is 1. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(8,6) (3), (8,7) (.), (8,8) (.), (9,6) ('_'), (9,8) (.), (10,6) (out of bounds), etc.\n\nBut (9,7) is 1. So there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to it. The unexplored cells are (8,7), (8,8), (9,8). So one of those must be a bomb. But how does that relate to (8,6)'s 3?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a spot that's definitely safe.\n\nLooking back at row 6, columns 5 and 6 are 2 and 2. Let's check (6,5) and (6,6). (6,5) is 2 with adjacent flags (5,6) and (7,5). So those two flags account for the two bombs. Therefore, the other adjacent cells should be safe. For example, (6,6) is 2. Let's check the adjacent cells of (6,6):\n\n(5,5) (1), (5,6) (F), (5,7) (.), (6,5) (2), (6,7) (.), (7,5) (F), (7,6) (.), (7,7) (.)\n\nBut (6,6) is 2. The adjacent flags are (5,6) and (7,5). Wait, no. (6,6) is adjacent to (5,6) (F), (5,7) (.), (6,5) (2), (6,7) (.), (7,5) (F), (7,6) (.), (7,7) (.), (5,5) (1). Wait, (6,6) is 2, and adjacent to two flags? (5,6) and (7,5) are not adjacent to (6,6). Wait, (6,6)'s adjacent cells are:\n\n(5,5), (5,6), (5,7),\n(6,5),        (6,7),\n(7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nSo (5,6) is F, (7,5) is F. Are those adjacent to (6,6)? (5,6) is one cell up and right. (7,5) is one cell down and left. So yes, (5,6) and (7,5) are adjacent to (6,6). So (6,6) is 2, and has two adjacent flags. So that's correct. Therefore, the other cells around (6,6) should be safe. For example, (5,7) is '.' and adjacent to (6,6). So (5,7) should be safe. Also, (6,7) is '.' and adjacent to (6,6). So those can be revealed.\n\nBut wait, (5,7) is adjacent to (5,6) (F) and (4,7) (2). Let's check if revealing (5,7) is safe. Since (6,6) is 2 and has two flags adjacent, (5,7) is adjacent to (6,6) and should be safe. So revealing (5,7) would be a good move.\n\nAlternatively, (6,7) is '.' and adjacent to (6,6) (2) which has two flags. So (6,7) should be safe. Let's check if there's any other numbers affecting (6,7). For example, (6,7) is adjacent to (5,7) (.), (5,6) (F), (6,6) (2), (7,7) (.), (7,6) (.), (7,5) (F). Since (6,6) is 2 with two flags, (6,7) should be safe. So revealing (6,7) is a possibility.\n\nBut which of these is more likely to be safe? Let's see. If we reveal (5,7), that could help with the (4,7) 2. Let's think: (4,7) is 2 with one flag (5,6). So there's one more bomb needed. If (5,7) is safe, then the remaining bomb could be in (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), etc. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8, column 6 is 3. The adjacent cells include (7,5) (F), (7,6) (.), (7,7) (.), (8,5) (1), (8,7) (.), (9,5) ('_'), (9,6) ('_'), (9,7) (1). So (8,6) is 3. The flags are (7,5) (F). So two more bombs needed. The cell (9,7) is 1, which requires one bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (9,7) are (8,6) (3), (8,7) (.), (8,8) (.), (9,6) ('_'), (9,8) (.), (10,7) (invalid). So (9,7) is 1. The bomb could be in (8,7) or (8,8) or (9,8). But (8,6) needs two more bombs. So if (8,7) is a bomb, that would count towards both (8,6)'s 3 and (9,7)'s 1. But (9,7) can only have one bomb. So if (8,7) is a bomb, then (9,7)'s 1 is satisfied, and (8,6) has two bombs (7,6 and 8,7, for example). But this is getting too complicated.\n\nLet's go back to the earlier idea of revealing (7,6). Since (6,5) is 2 with two flags, and (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5), it should be safe. Let's check the board state for (7,6). Row 7 is:\n\n_ _ _ _ _ F . . . .\n\nSo column 5 is F, columns 6-9 are '.' except column 5. So (7,6) is '.' and unexplored. Revealing (7,6) would be a safe move based on the two flags adjacent to (6,5). So that's a possible move.\n\nAnother possible move is (5,7). Let's check if that's safe. (5,7) is adjacent to (5,6) (F) and (6,6) (2). Since (6,6) has two flags adjacent, (5,7) should be safe. So revealing (5,7) is also a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, column 7 is '.' and adjacent to (5,6) (F) and (4,7) (2). Since (4,7) needs one more bomb, but (5,7) is adjacent to (5,6) (F), which is already counted in (4,7)'s count. Wait, (4,7) is 2. The adjacent cells include (5,6) (F) and (5,7) (.). So if (5,7) is a bomb, then (4,7) would have two bombs (5,6 and 5,7). But (5,7) is '.' and we don't know yet. But according to (6,6)'s 2 with two flags, (5,7) should be safe. So revealing (5,7) is safe.\n\nBut which of these moves is better? Let's see. Revealing (7,6) or (5,7) or (6,7) or (7,6). Let's pick one.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8, column 7 is '.' and adjacent to (8,6) (3). But that's part of the 3's requirement. Not sure.\n\nAnother area to check: row 0, column 5 is 1. Let's see. The cell (0,5) is 1. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(-1,4) invalid, (-1,5) invalid, (-1,6) invalid,\n(0,4) '_', (0,6) '.',\n(1,4) '_', (1,5) 1, (1,6) 2.\n\nSo the only unexplored cell adjacent to (0,5) is (0,6). The 1 at (0,5) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,4) '_', (0,6) '.', (1,4) '_', (1,5) 1, (1,6) 2. So the only possible bomb is (0,6). But there's no flag there yet. So if (0,6) is a bomb, then (0,5)'s 1 is satisfied. But since there are no flags nearby, we need to check if that's possible. But since flags remaining are 7, maybe we should place a flag there. But wait, the 1 at (0,5) has no adjacent flags. So the bomb must be in (0,6). So we can flag (0,6). But we need to check if that conflicts with other numbers.\n\nBut (1,6) is 2. The adjacent cells to (1,6) include (0,5) (1), (0,6) (.), (0,7) (.), (1,5) (1), (1,7) (2), (2,5) ('_'), (2,6) ('_'), (2,7) (1). If we flag (0,6), then (1,6)'s 2 would have one flag. So there must be another bomb adjacent to (1,6). The other cells around (1,6) are (0,7), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). (1,7) is 2, which might have its own bombs. This could be a chain, but maybe it's safe to flag (0,6) as a bomb.\n\nBut wait, the 1 at (0,5) requires exactly one bomb. The only possible cell is (0,6). So placing a flag there would satisfy that. But we need to check if that doesn't conflict with other numbers. For example, (1,6) is 2. If we flag (0,6), then (1,6) has one flag. So there must be another bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (1,6) are:\n\n(0,5) (1), (0,6) (F), (0,7) (.), (1,5) (1), (1,7) (2), (2,5) ('_'), (2,6) ('_'), (2,7) (1).\n\nSo the remaining bomb for (1,6) must be in (0,7), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). But (1,7) is 2, which would need two bombs. If (0,7) is a bomb, then (1,7)'s 2 would have one bomb (from (0,7)), and need another. But this is getting complex. However, since (0,5) requires a bomb at (0,6), we can flag it. But we have to make sure that this doesn't create a conflict. Let's check (1,6) after flagging (0,6). (1,6) is 2, with one flag at (0,6). So there must be one more bomb. The other cells could be (1,7) which is 2. (1,7) is adjacent to (0,6) (F), (0,7) (.), (0,8) (.), (1,6) (2), (1,8) (.), (2,6) ('_'), (2,7) (1), (2,8) (.). So (1,7) is 2. If (0,7) is a bomb, then (1,7) would have one bomb, and need another. But this is possible. However, this is speculative. But according to the rules, we need to check for conflicts. Flagging (0,6) would satisfy (0,5)'s 1, and (1,6)'s 2 would then require another bomb. But as long as there's a possible bomb elsewhere, it's okay. Since the total bombs are 10, and we have 7 flags remaining, placing a flag here would use one of them. But we need to be sure it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (0,6) is safe to reveal. If (0,5) is 1 and there's no flags nearby, then (0,6) could be the bomb. But revealing it would end the game. So we can't reveal it unless we're sure it's safe. But according to the 1 at (0,5), (0,6) must be the bomb. So we should flag it. But wait, the user has 7 flags remaining. Placing a flag here would reduce that to 6. But is this the correct move?\n\nBut wait, the cell (0,6) is unexplored ('.'). If we flag it, but it's not a bomb, then we lose when we run out of flags or when we reveal a bomb. So we need to be certain. The 1 at (0,5) requires exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. The only unexplored cell is (0,6). So (0,6) must be a bomb. Therefore, flagging (0,6) is correct. Let's check if there's any conflict.\n\nIf we flag (0,6), then (1,6) is 2 with one adjacent flag. So there must be one more bomb adjacent to (1,6). The other cells are (0,7), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). (1,7) is 2, which would need two bombs. So perhaps (0,7) and (1,8) are bombs. But this is getting into more complex analysis. However, according to the rules, as long as the flag placement doesn't create an immediate conflict, it's okay. The critical flag placement rules say that if a numbered tile shows '1' but already has an adjacent flag, there can't be another bomb. In this case, (0,5) is 1, and flagging (0,6) would satisfy that. So no conflict there. For (1,6), it's 2 with one flag, so another bomb is needed, but that's allowed. So flagging (0,6) seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the user has 7 flags remaining. They started with 10 bombs, so they can place up to 10 flags. But the current flags remaining are 7, meaning they've placed 3 flags already. So placing a fourth flag here would leave 6 remaining. But the total bombs are 10, so they need to place 10 flags. But the user might have placed some flags incorrectly. However, according to the problem statement, the flags remaining is 7, so the user has placed 3 flags. But the board shows three flags: (4,3), (5,6), (7,5). So that's three flags. So placing a flag at (0,6) would be the fourth flag, leaving 6 remaining. But according to the rules, each flag should mark a bomb. So if (0,6) is indeed a bomb, then this is correct. But how can we be sure?\n\nThe 1 at (0,5) has no other possible cells for a bomb except (0,6). Because all other adjacent cells are revealed as empty. So (0,6) must be a bomb. Therefore, flagging (0,6) is the correct move.\n\nBut wait, the user might have made a mistake in flagging other cells. For example, if (4,3) is not a bomb, then that's a problem. But according to the current analysis, we have to assume that existing flags are correct unless there's a conflict. Let's check if the existing flags are correct.\n\nFor example, the flag at (4,3). The cell (4,3) is flagged. Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (4,2) is 1, (4,4) is 1. The 1 at (4,2) is satisfied by the flag at (4,3). The 1 at (4,4) is also satisfied by the same flag. So that's okay. Because (4,3) is adjacent to both (4,2) and (4,4). So the flag at (4,3) is covering both of those 1s. But wait, each 1 requires exactly one bomb. If (4,3) is a bomb, then both (4,2) and (4,4) are satisfied. That's possible. So the flag at (4,3) is correct.\n\nSimilarly, the flag at (5,6) is adjacent to (5,5) (1), which is satisfied. And the flag at (7,5) is adjacent to (6,5) (2), which has two flags (5,6 and 7,5), which is correct. So existing flags seem okay.\n\nTherefore, flagging (0,6) is a valid move. But according to the analysis steps, we should first check for conflicts. Since there's no conflict here, and the 1 at (0,5) requires a bomb at (0,6), this is a valid flag placement.\n\nAlternatively, another possible move is to reveal (0,6), but that would be risky if it's a bomb. But according to the 1 at (0,5), it must be a bomb. So revealing it would lose the game. Therefore, the correct move is to flag (0,6).\n\nBut wait, the user might have made a mistake. For example, if (0,6) is not a bomb, then the 1 at (0,5) is incorrect, which is impossible because the game's numbers are accurate. So according to the rules, the numbers are correct. Therefore, (0,6) must be a bomb. So flagging it is correct.\n\nSo the next move should be to place a flag at (0,6). But let's confirm.\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell (0,5) is a 1 with only one adjacent unexplored cell at (0,6), which must be a bomb. Placing a flag here is required.\nMOVE: 0,6,true\n\nBut wait, the coordinate system says x is the row number (vertical), y is the column (horizontal). So (0,6) is row 0, column 6. Looking at the board state for row 0:\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n\nSo columns 0-5 are '_', column 5 is 1, columns 6-9 are '.'.\n\nWait, no. The row 0 is:\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n\nSo columns 0-4 are '_', column 5 is 1, columns 6-9 are '.'.\n\nSo (0,6) is column 6 of row 0, which is '.' (unexplored). So placing a flag there is correct.\n\nYes, this seems like the right move. So the answer is to place a flag at (0,6).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell (0,5) is a 1 with only one adjacent unexplored cell at (0,6), which must be a bomb.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 7, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next move, either placing a flag or revealing a tile. Let's start by analyzing the current state of the board and the game info.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with 10 bombs and 6 flags remaining. The board has some revealed numbers, flags, and unexplored areas (dots). Let's go through each revealed number and check if there are any obvious conflicts or safe moves.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 3 is a flag (F). The cell at (4,3) is flagged. Let's check the numbers around it. For example, the cell at (4,4) is a 1. Since there's a flag adjacent to it (at 4,3), that 1 should have exactly one bomb. So the other adjacent cells around (4,4) should be safe. Wait, (4,4) is a 1, and it's adjacent to the flag at (4,3). So the other adjacent cells to (4,4) can't have bombs. Let's check which cells those are. The adjacent cells would be (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). But (4,3) is already a flag, so the 1 at (4,4) is satisfied. So any other adjacent cells to (4,4) should be safe. Let's see if any of those are unexplored. For example, (5,5) is a 'F'? Wait, looking at row 5: the cells are _, _, 1, 1, 1, 1, F, ., ., . So (5,5) is a 1, (5,6) is F. Wait, maybe I need to check the board again.\n\nWait, the board state for row 4 is: _ _ 1 F 1 1 1 2 . . So (4,3) is F. Then (4,4) is 1. The cell (4,4) has a flag to its west (4,3). So the other adjacent cells should be safe. Let's check the cells around (4,4). The cells around (4,4) would be (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Let's check which of these are unexplored. For example, (3,5) is part of row 3: _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . So (3,5) is an underscore, which is empty. (4,5) is 1. (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1. So all those are revealed. So maybe there's no unexplored cells adjacent to (4,4). Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nLet's look for other numbers. For example, row 5: cells are _, _, 1, 1, 1, 1, F, ., ., . So (5,6) is a flag. The cell (5,6) is F. Let's check the numbers around it. The cell (5,5) is 1, which is adjacent to the flag at (5,6). So the 1 at (5,5) should have exactly one bomb. Since there's already a flag at (5,6), the other adjacent cells to (5,5) should be safe. The adjacent cells to (5,5) would be (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (5,6) is F. (4,4) is 1, (4,5) is 1, (4,6) is 1. (5,4) is 1. (6,4) is part of row 6: _, _, _, _, _, 2, 2, ., ., . So (6,4) is empty, (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2. So the unexplored cells adjacent to (5,5) would be (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)? Wait, (6,5) and (6,6) are 2s, which are revealed. So maybe (6,4) is empty. Wait, row 6 is: _ _ _ _ _ 2 2 . . . So (6,0) to (6,4) are empty or unexplored? Wait, the first five columns in row 6 are underscores, which are empty revealed spaces. Then (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2. So (6,4) is empty. So (5,5) is adjacent to (6,4), which is empty. Wait, but (5,5) is a 1 with a flag at (5,6). So the 1 at (5,5) is already satisfied. Therefore, the cell (6,4) should be safe. But (6,4) is already revealed as empty (underscore). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nLet's check row 7: _ _ _ _ _ F . . . . So (7,5) is a flag. Let's look at the numbers around it. The cell (6,5) is 2. The flag at (7,5) is adjacent to (6,5). So the 2 at (6,5) has one flag adjacent. Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (6,5). Let's check the adjacent cells to (6,5). The cells around (6,5) are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is F. (6,4) is empty, (6,6) is 2. (7,4) is part of row 7: _ _ _ _ _ F . . . . So (7,4) is empty (underscore), (7,5) is F, (7,6) is unexplored (dot). So the remaining adjacent cells to (6,5) that are unexplored are (7,6). Since (6,5) is a 2 with one flag (at 7,5), there must be another bomb. So (7,6) must be a bomb. Therefore, we can place a flag at (7,6). But we need to check if that's allowed. Let's check if placing a flag there conflicts with any other numbers.\n\nIf we place a flag at (7,6), let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (6,6) is a 2. The adjacent cells to (6,6) would include (7,6). If we place a flag there, then (6,6)'s count would be increased by 1. Let's see: (6,6) is a 2. The adjacent cells to (6,6) are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is F, (5,7) is dot, (6,5) is 2, (6,7) is dot, (7,5) is F, (7,6) would be a flag (if we place it), and (7,7) is dot. So the current count for (6,6) is: (5,6) is F (1), (7,5) is F (another 1?), but wait, (7,5) is adjacent to (6,6)? Let me check. (6,6) is at row 6, column 6. The adjacent cells would be row 5-7, columns 5-7. So (7,5) is adjacent (southwest), (7,6) is directly south. So (7,5) is adjacent to (6,6). So if (7,5) is a flag, that's one bomb. If we place a flag at (7,6), that's another bomb. Then (6,6) would have two bombs adjacent, which matches its number 2. So that's okay. So placing a flag at (7,6) would satisfy (6,5) and (6,6). But wait, (6,5) is a 2 with one existing flag (7,5). Adding a flag at (7,6) would make two flags adjacent to (6,5), which would make the count 2, matching the number. So that's correct. So (7,6) is a bomb. Therefore, we can place a flag there. But we need to check if there are any other constraints.\n\nAnother thing to check: the cell (7,6) is adjacent to (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). Let's look at row 8: _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 3 . . So (8,5) is 1, (8,6) is 1, (8,7) is 3. If we place a flag at (7,6), then (8,5) is adjacent to (7,6). The cell (8,5) is a 1. If (7,6) is a bomb, then (8,5) would have that bomb as adjacent, but (8,5) is a 1. Let's check what other adjacent cells (8,5) has. The adjacent cells to (8,5) are (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). (7,4) is empty, (7,5) is F, (7,6) would be F. (8,4) is empty, (8,6) is 1. (9,4) is part of row 9: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . So (9,4) is empty, (9,5) is dot, (9,6) is dot. So (8,5) is a 1. If (7,6) is a flag, then (8,5) has two adjacent flags (7,5 and 7,6). But (8,5) is a 1, which would be a conflict. That's a problem. So placing a flag at (7,6) would cause (8,5) to have two adjacent flags, but (8,5) is a 1. That's invalid. Therefore, we can't place a flag at (7,6) because it would create a conflict with (8,5).\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So the initial thought to flag (7,6) is invalid because it would make (8,5) have two adjacent flags, but (8,5) is a 1. So that's a conflict. Therefore, (7,6) can't be a bomb. Then where is the other bomb adjacent to (6,5)?\n\nWait, (6,5) is a 2. The existing flag is at (7,5). So there must be another bomb adjacent. Let's look at the other adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (6,5) are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is F, (6,4) is empty, (6,6) is 2, (7,4) is empty, (7,5) is F, (7,6) is dot. So the only unexplored cell is (7,6). But placing a flag there would conflict with (8,5). So maybe (7,6) is not a bomb. Then where else could the bomb be?\n\nWait, maybe there's another cell adjacent to (6,5) that's unexplored. Let's check again. (5,6) is F, (5,5) is 1, (5,4) is 1. (6,4) is empty. (6,6) is 2, which has its own adjacent cells. (7,4) is empty, (7,5) is F. So the only possible cell is (7,6). But that would conflict with (8,5). So this suggests that there's a contradiction here. But that can't be. Maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the cell (8,5) is a 1, but if (7,6) is a bomb, then (8,5) would have two adjacent bombs: (7,5) and (7,6). But (8,5) is a 1. That's a conflict. Therefore, (7,6) cannot be a bomb. So where is the other bomb adjacent to (6,5)? Maybe there's a bomb in another adjacent cell. Let's check again. All other adjacent cells to (6,5) are either revealed or have flags. (5,6) is a flag, (7,5) is a flag. The other cells are (5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4). (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (6,4) is empty, (6,6) is 2, (7,4) is empty. So none of these can be bombs. Therefore, this suggests that there's a conflict, which would mean that the existing flags are placed incorrectly. But according to the game info, the flags remaining are 6, and bombs are 10. So maybe there's a mistake in the current flags. But according to the rules, the numbers must be exact. So perhaps the existing flag at (7,5) is incorrect. But how?\n\nWait, the cell (7,5) is a flag. Let's check if that's correct. The cell (7,5) is in row 7: _ _ _ _ _ F . . . . So (7,5) is F. Let's check the numbers around it. For example, the cell (6,5) is 2. If (7,5) is a bomb, then (6,5) would have that as one of its two bombs. But we already considered that. But if (7,5) is not a bomb, then the flag is wrong. But according to the current board, (7,5) is flagged. So if that's a wrong flag, then the game would have a problem. But according to the rules, the numbers must be exact. So perhaps the flag at (7,5) is incorrect. But how can we determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another bomb adjacent to (6,5) that we're missing. Let's check the cell (5,6) which is a flag. The cell (5,6) is F. Let's check if that's correct. The cell (5,6) is adjacent to (5,5) which is 1. So (5,5) is a 1, and (5,6) is a flag. That's correct because the 1 would have exactly one bomb. So (5,6) is correctly flagged. Then (6,5) is a 2 with adjacent flags at (5,6) and (7,5). Wait, (5,6) is adjacent to (6,5)? Let me check. (6,5) is at row 6, column 5. The adjacent cells would include (5,5), (5,6), (5,4), etc. So (5,6) is adjacent to (6,5). So (6,5) has two flags adjacent: (5,6) and (7,5). But (6,5) is a 2. That's correct because two flags would mean two bombs, matching the number 2. Wait, but earlier I thought that (6,5) has one flag (7,5) and (5,6) is another. So if both are flags, then (6,5) is satisfied. Wait, but (5,6) is a flag, (7,5) is a flag. So (6,5) has two flags adjacent. But (6,5) is a 2. That's correct. So why did I think there was a problem earlier?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-examine. (6,5) is a 2. The adjacent flags are (5,6) and (7,5). So two flags, which matches the number 2. So that's correct. Then why did I think there was a problem with (8,5)? Because if (7,6) is a flag, then (8,5) would have two adjacent flags. But (7,6) isn't a flag yet. So the current flags are (5,6) and (7,5). So (6,5) is satisfied. Then where is the problem?\n\nWait, the initial analysis was that (6,5) is a 2 with one adjacent flag (7,5), but that's incorrect. Because (5,6) is also a flag adjacent to (6,5). So (6,5) has two flags adjacent, which matches the number 2. Therefore, there's no need for another bomb adjacent to (6,5). So my earlier mistake was not considering that (5,6) is adjacent to (6,5). Therefore, the 2 at (6,5) is already satisfied with the two flags. So there's no need for another bomb. Therefore, the cell (7,6) is safe. So perhaps I can reveal (7,6) safely.\n\nWait, but if (6,5) is already satisfied with two flags, then (7,6) is safe. So maybe (7,6) can be revealed. Let's check the adjacent cells to (7,6). If (7,6) is revealed, what would it show? Let's see. The cell (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5) (which is 2), (6,6) (which is 2), (6,7) (dot), (7,5) (F), (7,7) (dot), (8,5) (1), (8,6) (1), (8,7) (3). So the number of bombs adjacent to (7,6) would be the sum of flags in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\n- (6,5): 2 (but that's a number, not a bomb)\n- (6,6): 2 (number)\n- (6,7): dot (unexplored)\n- (7,5): F (bomb)\n- (7,7): dot\n- (8,5): 1 (number)\n- (8,6): 1 (number)\n- (8,7): 3 (number)\n\nSo the only bomb adjacent to (7,6) is (7,5). So if (7,6) is safe, revealing it would show a 1, since there's one adjacent bomb (7,5). But since (7,5) is a flag, that's accounted for. So revealing (7,6) would be safe. But how do we know that (7,6) isn't a bomb? Because (6,5) is a 2 with two adjacent flags, so (7,6) is not a bomb. Therefore, (7,6) can be safely revealed. So the move would be to reveal (7,6).\n\nBut wait, let's check if there are other possible moves. Let's look at other parts of the board. For example, row 8 has cells (8,5) as 1, (8,6) as 1, (8,7) as 3. Let's check (8,7) which is 3. The adjacent cells would include (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). (7,6) is dot, (7,7) is dot, (7,8) is dot, (8,6) is 1, (8,8) is dot, (9,6) is dot, (9,7) is 1, (9,8) is dot. So the 3 at (8,7) needs three bombs adjacent. Currently, there are no flags around it. So perhaps some of the unexplored cells around (8,7) are bombs. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother area to check is row 3. Row 3 is: _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . So (3,2) is 1, (3,3) is 1, (3,4) is 1, (3,7) is 1. Let's look at (3,4) which is 1. The adjacent cells would include (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (4,3) is F, (4,4) is 1, (3,3) is 1, (3,5) is empty. So the 1 at (3,4) has a flag at (4,3). Therefore, the other adjacent cells should be safe. For example, (3,5) is empty, (2,5) is part of row 2: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . So (2,5) is empty. So maybe there's no unexplored cells adjacent to (3,4).\n\nLooking at row 0: _ _ _ _ _ 1 F . . . So (0,6) is F. Let's check if that's correct. The cell (0,5) is 1. The adjacent cells to (0,5) would include (0,6). So the 1 at (0,5) has a flag at (0,6), which is correct. So that's okay.\n\nAnother area: row 5, column 6 is F. The cell (5,6) is F. The cell (5,5) is 1, which is adjacent to (5,6). So that's correct.\n\nNow, considering the flags remaining: 6. The current flags on the board are at (0,6), (4,3), (5,6), (7,5). Let's count them. Row 0: (0,6) is F. Row 4: (4,3) is F. Row 5: (5,6) is F. Row 7: (7,5) is F. So that's four flags. The game info says flags remaining: 6, so total flags placed are 10 - 6 = 4. So that matches. So there are 4 flags placed, 6 remaining. So we can place up to 6 more flags.\n\nBut back to possible moves. Earlier, I thought that (7,6) could be revealed safely. Let's confirm. Since (6,5) is a 2 with two adjacent flags (5,6 and 7,5), then (7,6) is not a bomb. So revealing (7,6) is safe. So that's a possible move.\n\nAnother possible move: looking at row 8, cell (8,7) is 3. The adjacent unexplored cells are (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). But without more info, it's hard to determine which are bombs.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, column 7 and 8 are dots. But row 6 is: _ _ _ _ _ 2 2 . . . So (6,7) and (6,8) are dots. The cell (6,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2. The adjacent cells to (6,6) are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is F, (5,7) is dot, (6,5) is 2, (6,7) is dot, (7,5) is F, (7,6) is dot, (7,7) is dot. The cell (6,6) is 2. The adjacent flags are (5,6) and (7,5). So two flags. So (6,6) is satisfied. Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7) must be safe. So (5,7) is a dot. So perhaps (5,7) can be revealed safely. Let's check.\n\nThe cell (5,7) is adjacent to (5,6) which is F. The cell (5,7) is unexplored. The cell (5,7) is adjacent to (4,6) which is 1. (4,6) is 1. The adjacent cells to (4,6) are (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). (3,5) is empty, (3,6) is empty, (3,7) is 1, (4,5) is 1, (4,7) is 2, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is F, (5,7) is dot. The 1 at (4,6) has a flag at (5,6). So the other adjacent cells should be safe. Therefore, (5,7) is safe to reveal. So that's another possible move.\n\nSo between (5,7) and (7,6), which is better? Let's see. Revealing (5,7) might open up more information. Let's check if there are any other constraints. For example, (5,7) is adjacent to (4,7) which is 2. The cell (4,7) is 2. The adjacent cells to (4,7) are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (3,6) is empty, (3,7) is 1, (3,8) is dot, (4,6) is 1, (4,8) is dot, (5,6) is F, (5,7) is dot, (5,8) is dot. The 2 at (4,7) has one flag at (5,6). So there must be another bomb adjacent. The possible unexplored cells are (3,8), (4,8), (5,7), (5,8). If (5,7) is safe, then the bomb must be in one of the others. But that's a separate issue.\n\nSo revealing (5,7) is safe. Let's consider that as a possible move. Alternatively, revealing (7,6) is also safe. Which one is better?\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9, column 7 is 1. The cell (9,7) is 1. Let's check adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9,6), (9,8), (8,6) is 1, (8,7) is 3, (8,8) is dot, (9,6) is dot, (9,8) is dot. The 1 at (9,7) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent unexplored cells are (9,6), (9,8), (8,8). So if any of those are bombs, but we don't have info yet.\n\nAnother area: row 2, column 7 is 1. The cell (2,7) is 1. Adjacent cells would include (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). (1,6) is 2, (1,7) is 2, (1,8) is dot, (2,6) is empty, (2,8) is dot, (3,6) is empty, (3,7) is 1, (3,8) is dot. The 1 at (2,7) must have one bomb. The unexplored cells are (1,8), (2,8), (3,8). So one of those must be a bomb. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nBack to the possible moves. Let's prioritize moves that can lead to more progress. Revealing (5,7) or (7,6) could open up more cells. Let's check which one is more likely to give information.\n\nIf we reveal (5,7), and it's a number, that could help with the 2 at (4,7). If it's a 0, that would open up more cells. Similarly, revealing (7,6) might give a number that helps with the 3 at (8,7).\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8, cell (8,7) is 3. The adjacent unexplored cells are (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). If we can find a cell that must be safe based on existing numbers, that would be good.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, column 0-4 are empty, and (7,5) is F. The cell (7,6) is dot. If we reveal (7,6), and it's a number, that could help.\n\nAnother possible move: looking at row 5, column 7 is dot. The cell (5,7) is adjacent to (4,7) which is 2. The 2 at (4,7) has one flag at (5,6). So there must be another bomb. The unexplored cells adjacent to (4,7) are (3,8), (4,8), (5,7), (5,8). If we reveal (5,7) and it's safe, then the bomb must be in one of the other three. But that's a bit of a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, column 5 is empty. The cell (3,5) is empty. The adjacent cells are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (3,4) is 1, (4,4) is 1, (4,5) is 1, (4,6) is 1. So all adjacent cells are numbers or empty. So no bombs there.\n\nHmm. Let's go back to the initial analysis. The cell (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5) which is 2 with two flags. So (7,6) is safe. Revealing it would be a good move. Let's proceed with that.\n\nAnother possible move: cell (6,7) is dot. The cell (6,7) is adjacent to (6,6) which is 2. The 2 at (6,6) has two adjacent flags (5,6 and 7,5). Wait, no. (6,6) is 2. The adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is F, (5,7) is dot, (6,5) is 2, (6,7) is dot, (7,5) is F, (7,6) is dot, (7,7) is dot. So the flags are (5,6) and (7,5). So two flags adjacent to (6,6). Therefore, the 2 at (6,6) is satisfied. So the remaining adjacent cells (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7) are safe. So (6,7) can be revealed safely. So that's another possible move.\n\nSo between (6,7), (5,7), (7,6), which is the best move? Let's see. Revealing (6,7) would be safe. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nThe cell (6,7) is adjacent to (6,6) which is 2. As per above, (6,6) has two flags adjacent, so (6,7) is safe. So revealing (6,7) is safe. Similarly, (5,7) is safe. So there are multiple safe moves.\n\nBut how to choose which one to do first? Let's look for cells that are adjacent to numbers that might give more information. For example, revealing (6,7) could help with the 2 at (6,6) and the 3 at (8,7). But since (6,6) is already satisfied, maybe (6,7) is a number that could help.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (7,6) could help with the 3 at (8,7). Let's say we reveal (7,6) and it's a 1. Then that would indicate one bomb adjacent to it, which could be (8,7) or others. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe based on existing numbers. For example, the cell (5,7) is adjacent to (4,7) which is 2. The 2 at (4,7) has one flag (5,6), so there must be one more bomb. The adjacent unexplored cells are (3,8), (4,8), (5,7), (5,8). If we reveal (5,7) and it's safe, then the bomb must be in one of the other three. But that's not immediately helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the cell (7,6) is adjacent to (8,5) which is 1. If (7,6) is revealed and is a number, that could help determine if there's a bomb in (8,6) or others.\n\nBut perhaps the safest move is to reveal (7,6) because it's adjacent to (6,5) which is a 2 with two flags, making (7,6) safe. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo the move would be to reveal (7,6). Let's check again for conflicts. If we reveal (7,6), and it's a number, say 1, then that would indicate one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent cells are (6,5) (2), (6,6) (2), (6,7) (dot), (7,5) (F), (7,7) (dot), (8,5) (1), (8,6) (1), (8,7) (3). The only bomb adjacent to (7,6) would be (7,5) which is already flagged. So the number would be 1. That's okay. But (8,5) is a 1, and (7,6) is adjacent to (8,5). If (7,6) is a 1, then (8,5) would have (7,5) and (7,6) as adjacent cells. But (7,5) is a flag, and (7,6) is a 1. So (8,5) is a 1, which would mean that there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. But (7,5) is a bomb, so (7,6) can't be a bomb. Therefore, (8,5) is satisfied with just (7,5) as the bomb. So revealing (7,6) as a 1 is okay. No conflict.\n\nTherefore, the move to reveal (7,6) is safe. Alternatively, revealing (6,7) is also safe. Let's choose one.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if there's a cell that must be a bomb based on existing numbers. For example, the cell (8,7) is 3. The adjacent unexplored cells are (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). The 3 at (8,7) needs three bombs. If we can find three cells that must be bombs, we can flag them. But without more info, it's hard.\n\nAnother approach: check if any numbers have exactly the number of unexplored cells equal to their remaining bombs. For example, the cell (8,7) is 3. If there are three unexplored cells adjacent, then all must be bombs. But there are more than three unexplored cells adjacent to (8,7). So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, look at row 8, cell (8,6) is 1. The adjacent cells are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). (7,5) is F, (7,6) is dot, (7,7) is dot, (8,5) is 1, (8,7) is 3, (9,5) is dot, (9,6) is dot, (9,7) is 1. The 1 at (8,6) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The existing flag is (7,5). So the bomb must be in one of the other cells. But (7,5) is adjacent to (8,6), but (7,5) is a flag. So the 1 at (8,6) requires exactly one bomb. Since (7,5) is a flag, that's the one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent cells (7,6), (7,7), (9,5), (9,6) must be safe. So (7,6) is safe, which aligns with our previous conclusion. So revealing (7,6) is safe.\n\nTherefore, the move is to reveal (7,6).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (7,6) is adjacent to the revealed '2' at (6,5), which already has two adjacent flags (at (5,6) and (7,5)). Since the '2' is satisfied, (7,6) must be safe to reveal. Additionally, the '1' at (8,6) confirms that (7,6) cannot be a bomb because the only adjacent flag is (7,5), fulfilling the '1's requirement. \n\nMOVE: 7,6,false", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 2 . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n3 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n4 _ _ 1 F 1 1 1 2 . .\n5 _ _ 1 1 1 1 F . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 2 2 . . .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ F . . . .\n8 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 3 . .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": false}
