{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "For the first move in Minesweeper, there are some strategic considerations:\n\n1. The best first move is typically in the center or near-center of the board, as this maximizes the potential for revealing the largest area.\n\n2. Corner moves are generally not optimal as they limit the directions in which the game can expand.\n\n3. The center provides the most information and the highest probability of revealing a large safe area.\n\nEXPLANATION: I recommend making the first move near the center of the board at coordinates (4,4). This is a common opening strategy as it maximizes the potential for revealing a large safe area and provides the most information for subsequent moves. The center position also gives us the best chance to create multiple paths for solving the puzzle if we hit a number.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Since it's close to the edge, and we can see some revealed safe spaces around it, the only places bombs could be are at (6,6) and (6,7).\n\n2. Since we know both these positions must contain bombs (to satisfy the '2'), the first one at (6,6) is a definite flag placement.\n\n3. This is a safe deduction because:\n   - The '2' at (6,5) needs exactly two bombs\n   - We have plenty of flags remaining (10)\n   - There are no conflicting numbers nearby\n   - The position at (6,6) is one of only two possible locations for bombs adjacent to this '2'\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (6,6) because the '2' at (6,5) must have exactly two bombs adjacent to it, and (6,6) is one of only two possible positions for these bombs.\n\nMOVE: 6,6,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 . . .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 2 . . . .\n7 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n8 . . 2 1 1 1 . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Looking at the surrounding numbers for that '2' at (6,5):\n- It has numbers 1,1 above it\n- A '1' to its left\n- A flagged square to its right\n- And unexplored squares below\n\n3. Since we know one bomb is at (6,6) and we need one more for the '2', and all other adjacent revealed numbers are '1', the only possible location for the second bomb must be at (7,6).\n\nThis deduction is safe because:\n- The '2' at (6,5) must have exactly two bombs\n- We already know one (the flagged square)\n- All other adjacent revealed squares are '1's, which means they can't have additional bombs beside what we're already accounting for\n\nEXPLANATION: The '2' at (6,5) already has one flag at (6,6), so there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to it.

However, I notice a potential conflict: The '2' at (1,6) has no flags near it yet, and the '2' at (2,6) also needs 2 bombs near it.\n\n4. Given the pattern of numbers and the existing flags at (6,6) and (7,6), there seems to be a conflict. The lower flag at (7,6) is likely incorrect because it would make it impossible to satisfy the '2's above without conflicts.\n\nEXPLANATION: I'm going to remove the flag at (7,6) because it conflicts with the pattern of numbers above it.
