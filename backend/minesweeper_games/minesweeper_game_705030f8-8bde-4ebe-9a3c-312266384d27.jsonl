Since it's a `1`, and there's only one bomb in its adjacent squares, we can deduce that out of (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1), only one of them is a bomb.\n\nLooking at position (0,1), which is a `2`, and its adjacent squares include (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2). We already know that (0,0) is not a bomb (since it's a revealed `1`), so the 2 bombs adjacent to (0,1) must be among (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2).\n\nHowever, we also know that position (1,1) is a `2`, and its adjacent squares include (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2). Again, (0,0) and (0,1) are not bombs, so the 2 bombs adjacent to (1,1) must be among (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).\n\n### Narrowing Down the Bomb Locations\n\nLet's consider the intersection of the possible bomb locations from both (0,1) and (1,1):\n\nFrom (0,1):\n- Possible bomb squares: (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n\nFrom (1,1):\n- Possible bomb squares: (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nThe common possible bomb squares are: (0,2), (1,0), (1,2)\n\nAdditionally, from (0,0), which has a `1`, the bomb must be either (0,1), (1,0), or (1,1). But (0,1) is already a `2`, so it's not a bomb. Therefore, the bomb adjacent to (0,0) must be either (1,0) or (1,1).\n\nHowever, looking back at our earlier deduction, (1,1) is a `2`, and its adjacent bombs must be among (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2). If (1,1) itself were a bomb, it would be adjacent to itself, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, (1,1) cannot be a bomb.\n\nThis means the bomb adjacent to (0,0) must be at (1,0).\n\n### Confirming the Bomb at (1,0)\n\nIf we place a flag at (1,0), let's verify if this aligns with the other numbers:\n\n**Position (0,1) with a `2`:**\nAdjacent squares: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\nWe've flagged (1,0) as a bomb, so we need one more bomb among (0,2), (1,1), and (1,2).\n\n**Position (1,1) with a `2`:**\nAdjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\nWe've flagged (1,0) as a bomb, so we need one more bomb among (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).\n\nLooking at (0,1) and (1,1), the common possible bomb squares are (0,2) and (1,2).\n\nIf we flag (0,2) as a bomb, let's check the implications:\n\n**Position (0,1) with a `2`:**\nFlags: (1,0) and (0,2) \u2014 satisfies the `2`.\n\n**Position (1,1) with a `2`:**\nFlags: (1,0) and (0,2) \u2014 satisfies the `2`.\n\nThis configuration seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if we flag (1,2) as a bomb:\n\n**Position (0,1) with a `2`:**\nFlags: (1,0) and (1,2) \u2014 satisfies the `2`.\n\n**Position (1,1) with a `2`:**\nFlags: (1,0) and (1,2) \u2014 satisfies the `2`.\n\nBoth options seem valid. However, we need to ensure that flagging either (0,2) or (1,2) doesn't conflict with other potential bomb placements.\n\n### Exploring Further to Determine the Best Flag Placement\n\nLet's consider the implications of flagging (0,2):\n\nIf (0,2) is a bomb:\n- Position (0,1) is satisfied with bombs at (1,0) and (0,2).\n- Position (1,1) is satisfied with bombs at (1,0) and (0,2).\n\nNow, let's look at position (0,2)'s adjacent squares:\n- (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nSince (0,2) is flagged as a bomb, we need to ensure that the numbers adjacent to it are consistent.\n\nHowever, (0,2) is unexplored, so we don't have direct information about its surrounding numbers. Therefore, flagging (0,2) doesn't provide additional conflicts at this stage.\n\nSimilarly, if we flag (1,2) as a bomb:\n- Position (0,1) is satisfied with bombs at (1,0) and (1,2).\n- Position (1,1) is satisfied with bombs at (1,0) and (1,2).\n\nNow, let's look at position (1,2)'s adjacent squares:\n- (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nAgain, since (1,2) is unexplored, flagging it doesn't introduce immediate conflicts.\n\n### Deciding Between Flagging (0,2) or (1,2)\n\nBoth (0,2) and (1,2) are valid candidates for being bombs based on our current analysis. To decide between them, we need to look for additional clues or consider the implications of each choice.\n\nLet's consider the unexplored squares adjacent to (0,2) and (1,2):\n\n**Adjacent to (0,2):**\n- (0,1) \u2014 already a `2`.\n- (0,3) \u2014 unexplored.\n- (1,1) \u2014 already a `2`.\n- (1,2) \u2014 unexplored.\n- (1,3) \u2014 unexplored.\n\n**Adjacent to (1,2):**\n- (0,1) \u2014 already a `2`.\n- (0,2) \u2014 unexplored.\n- (1,1) \u2014 already a `2`.\n- (1,3) \u2014 unexplored.\n- (2,1) \u2014 unexplored.\n- (2,2) \u2014 unexplored.\n\nSince both (0,2) and (1,2) are adjacent to unexplored squares, flagging either doesn't immediately reveal additional information. Therefore, choosing between them might require considering the overall distribution of bombs or looking for additional patterns.\n\nHowever, since our current analysis doesn't provide a clear preference between (0,2) and (1,2), and both are consistent with the numbers we have, we can choose either. For the sake of proceeding, let's choose to flag (0,2).\n\n### Verifying the Consistency After Flagging (0,2)\n\nAfter placing a flag at (0,2), let's ensure that all the numbers are still consistent:\n\n**Position (0,0) with a `1`:**\nAdjacent squares: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\nFlagged bomb: (1,0)\nConsistent: Only one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Position (0,1) with a `2`:**\nAdjacent squares: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\nFlagged bombs: (1,0), (0,2)\nConsistent: Two bombs adjacent.\n\n**Position (1,1) with a `2`:**\nAdjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\nFlagged bombs: (1,0), (0,2)\nConsistent: Two bombs adjacent.\n\nAll the numbers remain consistent with the flags placed at (1,0) and (0,2).\n\n### Considering the Next Move\n\nNow that we've flagged (1,0) and (0,2), let's identify the next safe move. We can look for numbers that are already satisfied by the adjacent flags, allowing us to reveal other adjacent squares with confidence.\n\nLooking at position (0,0), which is a `1`, and we've already flagged (1,0) as its only bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares, (0,1) and (1,1), are safe to reveal.\n\nLet's consider revealing (1,1):\n\n**Position (1,1)**: Currently unexplored. Revealing it will provide more information.\n\nHowever, before doing that, let's check if there are any other safe squares we can reveal more confidently.\n\nLooking at position (0,1), which is a `2`, and we've flagged (1,0) and (0,2) as bombs adjacent to it. Therefore, the other adjacent squares, (0,0), (1,1), and (1,2), are safe to reveal.\n\nBut (0,0) is already revealed as a `1`, so we can consider revealing (1,1) and (1,2).\n\nRevealing (1,1) would provide information about the surrounding squares, especially since it's adjacent to multiple unexplored areas.\n\n### Deciding to Reveal (1,1)\n\nGiven that (1,1) is adjacent to several unexplored squares, revealing it would help us gather more information about the bomb placements in the vicinity.\n\nTherefore, our next move will be to reveal (1,1).\n\n### Finalizing the Move\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n**EXPLANATION:** After identifying that (1,0) must be a bomb based on the `1` at (0,0) and ensuring consistency with the `2`s at (0,1) and (1,1), we've flagged (1,0) and (0,2) as bombs. To gather more information, we'll reveal (1,1), which is a safe square adjacent to the flagged bombs.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,1,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n1 . 2 . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

This means there is exactly one bomb in the adjacent squares.\n- At position (0,1), there's a '2'. This indicates two bombs in the surrounding squares.\n- At position (1,1), there's another '2', similar to (0,1).\n- All other positions are unexplored (denoted by '.').\n\n### Analyzing the Revealed Numbers\n\nLet's analyze each revealed number to understand where bombs might be:\n\n1. **Position (0,0): '1'**\n   - Adjacent squares: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n   - We know (0,1) has a '2', but it's not a bomb. So, the bomb must be among (1,0) or (1,1).\n\n2. **Position (0,1): '2'**\n   - Adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n   - (0,0) is '1', which we've already considered. So, bombs could be at (1,0), (1,1), or (1,2).\n\n3. **Position (1,1): '2'**\n   - Adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n   - We've already considered (0,0) and (0,1). So, bombs could be at (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), or (2,2).\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves\n\nLooking at position (0,0):\n\n- It shows '1', meaning exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\n- (0,1) is already a '2', so it's not a bomb.\n- Therefore, the bomb must be either at (1,0) or (1,1).\n\nSimilarly, considering position (0,1):\n\n- It shows '2', so there should be two bombs in its adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n- (0,0) is '1', so it's not a bomb.\n- Therefore, bombs must be at two of the following: (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nFrom position (1,1):\n\n- It also shows '2', so among its adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), there should be two bombs.\n  \nConsidering all these, let's deduce:\n\n- If we assume (1,0) is a bomb, then:\n  - Position (0,0) has its required one bomb.\n  - However, position (0,1) would need one more bomb among (0,2), (1,1), (1,2).\n  - Position (1,1) would also need one more bomb among (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\n- Alternatively, if we assume (1,1) is a bomb, then:\n  - Position (0,0) has its required one bomb.\n  - Position (0,1) would need one more bomb among (0,2), (1,0), (1,2).\n  - Position (1,1) would need one more bomb among (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nBoth scenarios are possible at this stage. Therefore, we need more information to determine the exact locations of the bombs.\n\n### Looking for Definite Bombs or Safe Spaces\n\nGiven the uncertainty, let's look for spaces that cannot be bombs based on the current information.\n\nConsider position (0,2):\n\n- It's adjacent to (0,1) and (1,1).\n- (0,1) shows '2', so there are two bombs around it: possibly (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n- If (0,2) were a bomb:\n  - Then (0,1) would have one bomb at (0,2), needing one more among (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n  - Position (1,1) shows '2', so if (0,2) is a bomb, it would need one more bomb among (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n  \nHowever, there's no immediate contradiction, so (0,2) could still be a bomb.\n\nNow, consider position (1,2):\n\n- Adjacent to (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2).\n- If (1,2) is a bomb:\n  - (0,1) would have one bomb at (1,2), needing one more among (0,2), (1,0), (1,1).\n  - (1,1) would have one bomb at (1,2), needing one more among (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nAgain, no immediate contradiction.\n\n### Considering the Number of Bombs Remaining\n\nThere are a total of 10 bombs on the board, and we have 10 flags remaining. This means we need to be cautious about placing flags without certainty.\n\n### Deciding on the Next Move\n\nGiven the analysis, there's no definitive bomb or safe space identified yet. However, we can make a safe move by revealing a square that cannot be a bomb based on the current information.\n\nLooking at position (2,0):\n\n- It's adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).\n- (1,0) and (1,1) are part of the earlier analysis.\n- If (1,0) is a bomb, then (2,0) cannot be a bomb.\n- If (1,1) is a bomb, then (2,0) could still be a bomb.\n  \nBut since we're unsure, let's consider position (0,2):\n\n- If we reveal (0,2), and it's not a bomb, it might provide more information about the surrounding numbers.\n\nAlternatively, revealing position (1,2) could also provide useful information.\n\nHowever, to minimize risk, let's choose a position that is less likely to be a bomb based on the current numbers.\n\nLet's choose position (2,0) because:\n\n- It's adjacent to (1,0) and (1,1).\n- If (1,0) is a bomb, then (2,0) is safe.\n- If (1,1) is a bomb, then (2,0) could still be safe unless there's another bomb nearby.\n\nGiven that there's a possibility of (2,0) being safe, it's a reasonable move to reveal it.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, revealing position (2,0) is a safe move that could provide more information about the surrounding squares.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Position (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0) and (1,1). Since (1,0) or (1,1) must be a bomb based on the '1' at (0,0), revealing (2,0) is a safe move to gather more information.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n1 . 2 . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Therefore, there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent tiles are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\n- (0,2) is already revealed as 1 with a flag at (1,2), so it's safe.\n- (1,2) is flagged, so it's a bomb.\n- Therefore, among (0,4), (1,3), (1,4), there must be exactly one bomb.\n\nLooking at **Tile (1,3)**: Value = 2, with one adjacent flag at (1,2). So, there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to (1,3). The adjacent tiles are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n\n- (0,2) is safe.\n- (1,2) is flagged.\n- So, among (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), there must be exactly one bomb.\n\nFrom **Tile (0,3)**, we know that among (0,4), (1,3), (1,4), there must be exactly one bomb. Combining this with **Tile (1,3)**, we can deduce that the bomb must be at either (0,4) or (1,4).\n\nLet's consider **Tile (0,4)**:\n\nIf we place a flag at (0,4), then:\n\n- **Tile (0,3)**: Adjacent bomb at (0,4) satisfies its value of 1.\n- **Tile (1,3)**: Adjacent bomb at (0,4) satisfies its value of 2 (since there's already a flag at (1,2)).\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if we place a flag at (1,4):\n\n- **Tile (0,3)**: Adjacent bomb at (1,4) satisfies its value of 1.\n- **Tile (1,3)**: Adjacent bomb at (1,4) satisfies its value of 2.\n\nBoth placements seem possible. However, we need to ensure that placing a flag at either (0,4) or (1,4) doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nLet's check **Tile (1,4)**:\n\nIf we place a flag at (1,4), we need to ensure that it doesn't conflict with any adjacent numbers.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (1,4): (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nLooking at **Tile (0,4)**: It's unexplored, so placing a flag at (1,4) doesn't immediately conflict.\n\nSimilarly, placing a flag at (0,4) doesn't conflict with any revealed numbers.\n\nGiven that both placements are possible, we need to choose one. Let's choose to place a flag at (0,4) first.\n\n**EXPLANATION**: Tile (0,3) has a value of 1 with no adjacent flags, and Tile (1,3) has a value of 2 with one adjacent flag.

We have one flag at (2,0), so no additional bombs should be adjacent to (3,1).\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Conflicts**\n\nFrom the above analysis, the primary conflict is at **(1,1): 2**, which has three adjacent flags at (1,0), (1,2), and (2,0). According to the rules, a '2' can only have two adjacent bombs, so having three flags adjacent is impossible.\n\n### **Step 3: Resolving the Conflict**\n\nTo resolve this, we need to determine which of the three flags might be incorrectly placed.\n\n1. **Flag at (1,0):**\n   - This flag is also adjacent to (0,0): 1, which already has one bomb adjacent at (1,0). Since (0,0) only requires one bomb, the flag at (1,0) is correctly placed.\n\n2. **Flag at (1,2):**\n   - This flag is adjacent to (0,2): 1, which already has one bomb adjacent at (1,2). Since (0,2) only requires one bomb, the flag at (1,2) is correctly placed.\n\n3. **Flag at (2,0):**\n   - This flag is adjacent to (1,0): F, (2,1): 2, and (3,0): 1.\n   - **(1,0): F** is already accounted for.\n   - **(2,1): 2** has flags at (2,0) and (2,2).\n   - **(3,0): 1** has one bomb adjacent at (2,0).\n   - If we remove the flag at (2,0), (2,1): 2 would still have one flag at (2,2), meaning there must be another bomb adjacent to (2,1).\n\nHowever, removing the flag at (2,0) would leave (2,1): 2 with only one flag at (2,2), meaning there must be another bomb adjacent to (2,1). Let's explore this possibility.\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring the Removal of Flag at (2,0)**\n\nIf we remove the flag at (2,0):\n\n- **(2,1): 2** would have only one flag at (2,2).\n  - Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (2,1).\n  - The adjacent unexplored squares to (2,1) are (1,1), (1,2), (3,1), (3,0), (3,2).\n\nHowever:\n\n- **(1,1): 2** already has two flags at (1,0) and (1,2), so no additional bombs can be adjacent.\n- **(1,2): F** is already flagged.\n- **(3,1): 1** has one bomb adjacent at (2,0) (which we're removing), so no additional bombs can be adjacent.\n- **(3,0): 1** has one bomb adjacent at (2,0) (which we're removing), so no additional bombs can be adjacent.\n- **(3,2): .** unexplored.\n\nThis means the only possible location for the additional bomb adjacent to (2,1) is (3,2).\n\n### **Step 5: Placing a Flag at (3,2)**\n\nGiven that (2,1): 2 needs two adjacent bombs, and we only have one flag at (2,2), we need to place a flag at (3,2) to satisfy the condition.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **(2,1): 2** would then have flags at (2,2) and (3,2), which aligns correctly with the number '2'.\n- **(3,2): F** would indicate a bomb, but we need to ensure this doesn't create new conflicts.\n\nLet's check adjacent squares to (3,2):\n\n- **(2,1): 2** \u2013 already has flags at (2,2) and (3,2), which is correct.\n- **(3,1): 1** \u2013 has one bomb adjacent at (2,0) (which we're removing), but we're placing a flag at (3,2), which is adjacent to (3,1). This would mean (3,1): 1 has two adjacent bombs, which is a conflict.\n\n**Conflict Identified:**\n\nPlacing a flag at (3,2) would cause (3,1): 1 to have two adjacent bombs (at (2,0) and (3,2)), which contradicts the '1' indicating only one bomb adjacent.\n\n### **Step 6: Conclusion**\n\nGiven the above analysis, removing the flag at (2,0) and attempting to place a flag at (3,2) creates a new conflict at (3,1): 1. Therefore, the initial assumption that the flag at (2,0) is incorrect may not hold, and another approach is needed.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Re-evaluating the Conflict at (1,1): 2**\n\nLet's revisit the conflict at (1,1): 2, which has three adjacent flags at (1,0), (1,2), and (2,0).\n\nSince the number '2' can only have two adjacent bombs, one of these three flags must be incorrectly placed.\n\n1. **Flag at (1,0):**\n   - Adjacent to (0,0): 1, which only needs one bomb adjacent at (1,0). Therefore, the flag at (1,0) is correctly placed.\n\n2. **Flag at (1,2):**\n   - Adjacent to (0,2): 1, which only needs one bomb adjacent at (1,2). Therefore, the flag at (1,2) is correctly placed.\n\n3. **Flag at (2,0):**\n   - Adjacent to (1,0): F, (2,1): 2, and (3,0): 1.\n   - **(1,0): F** is already accounted for.\n   - **(2,1): 2** has flags at (2,0) and (2,2).\n   - **(3,0): 1** has one bomb adjacent at (2,0).\n\nIf we remove the flag at (2,0):\n\n- **(2,1): 2** would have only one flag at (2,2), meaning there must be another bomb adjacent to (2,1).\n  - The only unexplored adjacent square is (3,2).\n\nHowever, as previously determined, placing a flag at (3,2) would cause a conflict at (3,1): 1.\n\nTherefore, the only resolution is that the flag at (2,0) is incorrectly placed, and we need to remove it to avoid the conflict at (1,1): 2.\n\n### **Final Decision: Remove the Flag at (2,0)**\n\nBy removing the flag at (2,0), we resolve the conflict at (1,1): 2, which now has only two adjacent flags at (1,0) and (1,2), aligning with the number '2'. Additionally, this allows us to proceed without creating new conflicts elsewhere on the board.\n\n### **Next Move**\n\n**Explanation:**\nTo resolve the conflict at (1,1): 2, which has three adjacent flags, we determine that the flag at (2,0) is incorrectly placed. Removing this flag ensures that each numbered tile has the correct number of adjacent bombs as indicated by their numbers.\n\n**Move:**\n```\nMOVE: 2,0,true\n```\n*Note: Since the square at (2,0) is already flagged, setting `flag=true` will remove the flag.*", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 2 1 1 F . . . . .\n1 F 2 F 2 . . . . . .\n2 F 2 F . . . . . . .\n3 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Therefore, squares `(0,1)` and `(1,1)` are safe to reveal.\n\n**Checking `(0,1): 2`:**\nAdjacent squares: `(0,0)`, `(0,2)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`.\nFlags in adjacent squares: `(1,0)` and `(1,2)`.\nSince the number is '2' and there are already two flags adjacent, there are no more bombs adjacent to `(0,1)`. Therefore, squares `(0,2)` and `(1,1)` are safe to reveal.\n\nWait, there's a conflict here. `(1,1)` is adjacent to both `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`. Since `(0,1)` has two flags adjacent (`(1,0)` and `(1,2)`), and `(1,1)` is adjacent to `(1,0)`, which is flagged, `(1,1)` cannot be a bomb. Therefore, it's safe to reveal.\n\n**Checking `(0,2): 1`:**\nAdjacent squares: `(0,1)`, `(0,3)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`.\nFlags in adjacent squares: `(1,2)`.\nSince there's one flag adjacent, there cannot be another bomb adjacent to `(0,2)`. Therefore, squares `(0,1)`, `(0,3)`, `(1,1)`, and `(1,3)` are safe to reveal.\n\nWait, `(1,2)` is flagged, so `(1,1)` and `(1,3)` are adjacent to `(0,2)` but `(1,2)` is already flagged, so `(1,1)` and `(1,3)` cannot be bombs. But `(1,1)` is already considered safe.\n\n**Checking `(0,3): 1`:**\nAdjacent squares: `(0,2)`, `(0,4)`, `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`.\nFlags in adjacent squares: `(0,4)` and `(1,2)`.\nSince there are two flags adjacent, but the number is '1', this indicates a conflict. This suggests that one of the flags is incorrectly placed.\n\nWait, let's re-examine:\n\n`(0,3): 1` has adjacent squares `(0,2)`, `(0,4)`, `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`.\nFlags in adjacent squares: `(0,4)` and `(1,2)`.\nSince the number is '1', but there are two flags adjacent, this is a conflict. Therefore, one of these flags is incorrectly placed.\n\n**Identifying the Incorrect Flag:**\n\nLet's look at `(0,4): F` and `(1,2): F`.\n\nCheck `(0,4): F`:\nAdjacent squares: `(0,3)`, `(0,5)`, `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`, `(1,5)`.\nNumbers adjacent to `(0,4)`: `(0,3): 1`.\nSince `(0,3): 1` has a conflict due to two adjacent flags, and `(0,4)` is one of them, let's see if removing `(0,4)`'s flag resolves the conflict.\n\nIf we remove the flag at `(0,4)`, then `(0,3): 1` would only have one adjacent flag `(1,2)`, which would be correct.\n\nCheck `(1,2): F`:\nAdjacent squares: `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(0,3)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,3)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`, `(2,3)`.\nNumbers adjacent to `(1,2)`: `(0,1): 2`, `(0,2): 1`, `(1,1): 2`, `(1,3): 2`, `(2,1): 2`, `(2,2): F`.\n\nLet's see if removing `(1,2)`'s flag affects any numbers.\n\nFor `(0,1): 2`, adjacent flags: `(1,0)` and `(1,2)`.\nIf we remove `(1,2)`'s flag, then `(0,1)` would only have one adjacent flag `(1,0)`, but the number is '2', so there must be another bomb adjacent. This suggests `(1,1)` could be a bomb.\n\nBut `(1,1)` is adjacent to `(1,0)` and `(1,2)`. If `(1,2)` is unflagged, then `(1,1)` could indeed be a bomb to satisfy `(0,1): 2`.\n\nHowever, let's consider `(1,1): 2`:\nAdjacent squares: `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,0)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`.\nFlags adjacent: `(1,0)` and `(1,2)`.\nIf we remove `(1,2)`'s flag, then `(1,1)` would have one adjacent flag `(1,0)`, so it needs one more bomb adjacent.\n\nLooking at the adjacent squares, `(0,1)` is a '2' and already has one adjacent flag `(1,0)`. If `(1,1)` is a bomb, that would satisfy both `(0,1): 2` and `(1,1): 2`.\n\nBut let's double-check:\n\n`(1,1): 2` with adjacent squares `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,0)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`.\nFlags adjacent: `(1,0)` and `(1,2)`.\nIf we remove `(1,2)`'s flag, then `(1,1)` needs one more bomb adjacent. Possible candidates are `(0,1)` and `(2,1)`.\n\nBut `(0,1)` is a '2' and already has a flag at `(1,0)`. If `(0,1): 2` has one flag `(1,0)`, then there must be another bomb adjacent, which could be `(1,1)`.\n\nSimilarly, `(2,1): 2` has adjacent squares `(1,0)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,0)`, `(2,2)`, `(3,0)`, `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`.\nFlags adjacent: `(1,0)` and `(1,2)`.\nIf we remove `(1,2)`'s flag, then `(2,1)` needs one more bomb adjacent, which could be `(1,1)`.\n\nTherefore, removing `(1,2)`'s flag and flagging `(1,1)` would resolve the conflicts.\n\n### Step 4: Deciding the Next Move\n\nBased on the above analysis, the flag at `(1,2)` is causing a conflict with `(0,3): 1`. Therefore, I need to remove the flag at `(1,2)`.\n\nAfter removing the flag, I can then analyze further to see if `(1,1)` should be flagged as a bomb, given the numbers `(0,1): 2` and `(1,1): 2`.\n\n**Remove Flag at `(1,2)`:**\n\n```\nMOVE: 1,2,true\n```\n\nWait, to remove a flag, I need to make a move with `flag=true` on an already flagged square. Therefore, to remove the flag at `(1,2)`, I should set `flag=true` on that square.\n\nAfter removing the flag, I can then consider flagging `(1,1)` as a bomb.\n\n**Flag `(1,1)` as a Bomb:**\n\n```\nMOVE: 1,1,true\n```\n\nHowever, since I can only make one move at a time, I'll prioritize removing the conflicting flag first.\n\n### Step 5: Finalizing the Move\n\nGiven that the flag at `(1,2)` is causing a conflict with `(0,3): 1`, the next logical move is to remove the flag at `(1,2)`.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The flag at `(1,2)` causes a conflict with the number '1' at `(0,3)`, which should only have one adjacent bomb. Removing this flag will help resolve the inconsistency.\n\n**MOVE:** `1,2,true` (remove the flag at `(1,2)`)\n\nAfter making this move, I can re-evaluate the board to determine the next steps, such as flagging `(1,1)` or revealing other safe squares.", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 2 1 1 F . . . . .\n1 F 2 F 2 . . . . . .\n2 1 2 F . . . . . . .\n3 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Here's what I observed:\n\n- **Row 0:** `1, 2, 1, 1, F, ., ., ., ., .`\n  - (0,0): `1`\n  - (0,1): `2`\n  - (0,2): `1`\n  - (0,3): `1`\n  - (0,4): `F` (Flagged)\n  \n- **Row 1:** `F, F, F, 2, ., ., ., ., ., .`\n  - (1,0): `F` (Flagged)\n  - (1,1): `F` (Flagged)\n  - (1,2): `F` (Flagged)\n  - (1,3): `2`\n  \n- **Row 2:** `1, 2, F, ., ., ., ., ., ., .`\n  - (2,0): `1`\n  - (2,1): `2`\n  - (2,2): `F` (Flagged)\n  \n- **Row 3:** `1, 1, ., ., ., ., ., ., ., .`\n  - (3,0): `1`\n  - (3,1): `1`\n  \nThe rest of the board (rows 4 to 9) is unexplored, marked with dots (`.`).\n\n### Step 2: Verifying Existing Flags Against Revealed Numbers\n\nNext, I checked if the existing flags correctly correspond to the adjacent numbers.\n\n#### Checking (0,4) - Flagged\n\n- **Adjacent Numbers:**\n  - (0,3): `1`\n  - (1,3): `2`\n  - (1,4): `.` (Unexplored)\n  \n**Analysis:**\n- (0,3) is `1`, and it has one adjacent flag at (0,4). This means there are no other bombs adjacent to (0,3).\n- (1,3) is `2`, and it must have two adjacent bombs. Currently, there's one flag at (1,4). Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (1,3).\n\n#### Checking (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) - All Flagged\n\n- **Adjacent Numbers:**\n  - (0,0): `1`\n  - (0,1): `2`\n  - (0,2): `1`\n  - (1,3): `2`\n  - (2,0): `1`\n  - (2,1): `2`\n  \n**Analysis:**\n- (0,0) is `1` and has flags at (1,0) and (1,1). This is a conflict because a `1` can only have one adjacent bomb, but there are two flags. This suggests that one of these flags is misplaced.\n\n#### Checking (2,2) - Flagged\n\n- **Adjacent Numbers:**\n  - (1,2): `F` (Flagged)\n  - (1,3): `2`\n  - (2,1): `2`\n  \n**Analysis:**\n- (1,3) is `2` and has one flag at (1,2) and another at (2,2). This satisfies the requirement of two adjacent bombs.\n- (2,1) is `2` and has one flag at (2,2), implying there must be another bomb adjacent to it.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying and Resolving Conflicts\n\nFrom the above analysis, I noticed a conflict at (0,0), which is `1` but has two adjacent flags at (1,0) and (1,1). This is incorrect because a `1` can only have one adjacent bomb.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Since (0,0) is `1` and has two adjacent flags, at least one of these flags is wrong. I need to decide which one to remove.\n\n**Decision:**\nLooking further:\n- (1,0) and (1,1) are both flagged. However, (1,1) is adjacent to (0,1), which is `2`. (0,1) already has a flag at (0,4), and it needs two adjacent bombs. Since (1,1) is flagged, it's likely correct.\n\nTherefore, the flag at (1,0) seems to be the misplaced one. I'll remove it.\n\n### Step 4: Planning the Next Move\n\nAfter resolving the conflict, I considered the remaining flags and the numbers to determine the next move.\n\n**Flags Remaining:** 5\n\n**Bombs:** 10\n\n**Placed Flags:** 4 (at (0,4), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2))\n\n**Analysis of (1,3):** It's `2` with one flag at (1,2).

Since (1,3) needs another bomb, one of these must be a bomb.\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n1. **Place a Flag:** I could place a flag at either (1,4) or (2,3).\n2. **Reveal a Square:** Revealing one of these squares to confirm if it's a bomb.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that I have sufficient flags remaining and to minimize risk, I'll place a flag at (1,4), as it's a logical choice based on the number at (1,3).\n\n### Step 5: Executing the Move\n\n**EXPLANATION:** To resolve the conflict at (0,0) and ensure the number at (1,3) has two adjacent bombs, I'm removing the misplaced flag at (1,0) and placing a new flag at (1,4) to satisfy the number at (1,3).\n\n**MOVE:**\n1. **Remove Flag:** 1,0,true\n2. **Place Flag:** 1,4,true\n\nHowever, since the format requires a single move, I'll focus on placing the flag at (1,4), as removing the misplaced flag is a prerequisite.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** 1,4,true\n\nThis move ensures that the number at (1,3) has the required two adjacent bombs and resolves the earlier conflict by removing the incorrect flag at (1,0).", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 2 1 1 F . . . . .\n1 F F F 2 . . . . . .\n2 1 2 F . . . . . . .\n3 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Therefore, (3,0) must be a bomb.\n\n3. **Flag placement**:\n   - We can place a flag at (0,4) and (3,0) since they must be bombs based on the numbers.\n\n### MOVE:\nSince we have identified (0,4) as a bomb, we will place a flag there.\n\n**MOVE**: 0,4,true", "flags_remaining": 4, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 2 1 1 F . . . . .\n1 F F F 2 F . . . . .\n2 1 2 F . . . . . . .\n3 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

This is a conflict.\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Resolve Conflicts\n\nFrom the above analysis, multiple tiles have conflicts where the number of adjacent flags exceeds the number displayed. This suggests that some of the flags may be incorrectly placed.\n\nLet's focus on the tile (0,0) which shows '1' but has two adjacent flags at (1,0) and (1,1). Since the tile can only have one adjacent bomb, one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, tile (0,1) shows '2' but has three adjacent flags at (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2). This indicates that at least one of these flags is incorrect.\n\nGiven that multiple tiles are showing conflicts with the flags at (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2), it's likely that these flags are incorrectly placed.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the Remaining Number of Flags vs Bombs\n\nTotal bombs: 10\nFlags placed: 5\nFlags remaining: 5\n\nIf we remove the potentially incorrect flags at (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2), we would have 8 flags remaining, which is more than the total number of bombs. This suggests that not all of these flags are incorrect, but at least one is.\n\n### Step 4: Decide on the Next Move\n\nGiven the conflicts, the safest move is to remove one of the potentially incorrect flags to see if it resolves the conflicts. Let's choose to remove the flag at (1,0).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The tile at (0,0) shows '1' but has two adjacent flags at (1,0) and (1,1). Removing the flag at (1,0) will help determine if it was incorrectly placed, resolving the conflict.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,0,true\n\n(Note: Since the tile at (1,0) is already flagged, setting `flag=true` will remove the flag.)", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 2 1 1 . . . . . .\n1 F F F 2 F . . . . .\n2 1 2 F . . . . . . .\n3 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Correct.\n\n- **Cell (0,2):** `1`\n  - Adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n  - Flagged adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2)\n  - **Consistency:** The number indicates `1` bomb, but there are `2` adjacent flags. **This is a conflict.**\n\nWait a minute, that's a problem. The cell at (0,2) shows a `1`, but there are `2` adjacent flags at (1,1) and (1,2). This violates the rule that the number must exactly match the number of adjacent bombs.\n\n**Identifying the Issue:**\nThe cell at (0,2) having a `1` with two adjacent flags implies that there's an inconsistency. This could mean that one of the flags is incorrectly placed.\n\n**Possible Actions:**\n1. **Remove one of the flags:** Since the number `1` can only have one bomb adjacent, one of the flags at (1,1) or (1,2) might be wrongly placed.\n2. **Verify the other numbers around these flags to see if removing a flag resolves the inconsistency.**\n\n**Analyzing Row 1:**\n- **Cell (1,3):** `2`\n  - Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n  - Flagged adjacent cells: (1,2)\n  - **Consistency:** The number indicates `2` bombs, but only `1` flag is adjacent. Therefore, there must be another bomb in one of the adjacent unexplored cells.\n\n**Analyzing Row 2:**\n- **Cell (2,0):** `1`\n  - Adjacent cells: (1,0), (1,1), (2,1)\n  - Flagged adjacent cells: (1,1)\n  - **Consistency:** The number `1` matches the `1` adjacent flag. Correct.\n\n- **Cell (2,1):** `2`\n  - Adjacent cells: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2)\n  - Flagged adjacent cells: (1,1)\n  - **Consistency:** The number `2` indicates two bombs, but only `1` adjacent flag. Therefore, there must be another bomb in one of the adjacent unexplored cells.\n\n**Analyzing Row 3:**\n- **Cell (3,0):** `1`\n  - Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1)\n  - Flagged adjacent cells: None\n  - **Consistency:** The number `1` indicates one bomb adjacent, and there are no adjacent flags. Correct.\n\n- **Cell (3,1):** `1`\n  - Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2)\n  - Flagged adjacent cells: None\n  - **Consistency:** The number `1` indicates one bomb adjacent, and there are no adjacent flags. Correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Resolving the Conflict at (0,2)**\n\nGiven the conflict at (0,2) where a `1` has two adjacent flags at (1,1) and (1,2), we need to determine which flag might be incorrectly placed.\n\n**Option 1: Flag at (1,1) is incorrect**\n- **Implications:** If (1,1) is not a bomb, then the `1` at (0,2) would only have one bomb adjacent, which is consistent.\n  \n**Option 2: Flag at (1,2) is incorrect**\n- **Implications:** If (1,2) is not a bomb, then the `1` at (0,2) would only have one bomb adjacent, which is consistent.\n\n**Analyzing the Impact of Removing Each Flag:**\n\n**Removing Flag at (1,1):**\n- **Effect on (0,2):** Now, only one adjacent flag at (1,2), which matches the `1`.\n- **Effect on (1,3):** Still needs one more bomb adjacent since it indicates `2` and only has `1` flag at (1,2).\n- **Effect on (2,1):** Still needs one more bomb adjacent since it indicates `2` and only has `1` flag at (1,1) (which is now removed).\n\n**Removing Flag at (1,2):**\n- **Effect on (0,2):** Now, only one adjacent flag at (1,1), which matches the `1`.\n- **Effect on (1,3):** Still needs one more bomb adjacent since it indicates `2` and only has `1` flag at (1,1).\n- **Effect on (2,1):** Still needs one more bomb adjacent since it indicates `2` and only has `1` flag at (1,1).\n\n**Decision:**\nRemoving either flag resolves the inconsistency at (0,2). However, we need to determine which flag to remove by examining other parts of the board.\n\n### **Step 3: Examining Other Numbered Cells for Additional Clues**\n\n**Looking at Cell (1,3):** `2`\n- Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n- Flagged adjacent cells: (1,2)\n- **Analysis:** The number `2` indicates two bombs, but only one flag at (1,2). Therefore, there must be another bomb in one of the adjacent unexplored cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n\n**Looking at Cell (2,1):** `2`\n- Adjacent cells: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2)\n- Flagged adjacent cells: (1,1)\n- **Analysis:** The number `2` indicates two bombs, but only one flag at (1,1). Therefore, there must be another bomb in one of the adjacent unexplored cells: (1,0), (1,2), (2,2).\n\n**Looking at Cell (0,4):** `.` (unexplored)\n- Adjacent to (1,3) which indicates `2` and has one flag at (1,2).\n- **Analysis:** Could be a potential bomb, but we need more information.\n\n**Looking at Cell (2,2):** `F` (flagged)\n- **Analysis:** Already flagged, so assuming it's a bomb.\n\nWait, looking back at the board, cell (2,2) is flagged. So, in the context of cell (1,3), which indicates `2` and has one flag at (1,2), and if (2,2) is also a bomb, then:\n\n- **Adjacent flags to (1,3):** (1,2) and (2,2)\n- **Consistency:** Now, `2` bombs adjacent, which matches the number `2`. No conflict.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that (0,2) has a conflict because it's adjacent to (1,1) and (1,2), both flagged, but it shows `1`. However, if (2,2) is also flagged, then (0,2) is adjacent to three flags: (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2). But (0,2) shows `1`, which is a bigger conflict.\n\nWait, let's double-check:\n\n**Adjacent cells to (0,2):** (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n- **Flagged adjacent cells:** (1,1), (1,2)\n- **Number at (0,2):** `1`\n- **Conflict:** Two adjacent flags for a `1`.\n\nWait, earlier I thought (2,2) is adjacent to (0,2), but actually, (2,2) is not adjacent to (0,2). Let's list the adjacent cells to (0,2):\n\n- (0,1): `2`\n- (0,3): `1`\n- (1,1): `F`\n- (1,2): `F`\n- (1,3): `2`\n\nSo, (0,2) is adjacent to (1,1) and (1,2), both flagged.\n\nTherefore, the conflict remains: `1` at (0,2) with two adjacent flags.\n\nThus, one of the flags at (1,1) or (1,2) must be incorrect.\n\n### **Step 4: Determining Which Flag to Remove**\n\nTo decide which flag to remove, let's examine the implications of removing each flag.\n\n**Option 1: Remove Flag at (1,1)**\n\n- **Effect on (0,2):** Now, only one adjacent flag at (1,2), which matches the `1`.\n- **Effect on (1,3):** Still needs one more bomb adjacent since it indicates `2` and only has `1` flag at (1,2).\n- **Effect on (2,1):** Still needs one more bomb adjacent since it indicates `2` and only has `1` flag at (1,1) (which is now removed).\n\n**Option 2: Remove Flag at (1,2)**\n\n- **Effect on (0,2):** Now, only one adjacent flag at (1,1), which matches the `1`.\n- **Effect on (1,3):** Still needs one more bomb adjacent since it indicates `2` and only has `1` flag at (1,1).\n- **Effect on (2,1):** Still needs one more bomb adjacent since it indicates `2` and only has `1` flag at (1,1).\n\n**Further Analysis:**\n\nLet's look at cell (1,0): `.` (unexplored)\n- Adjacent to (1,1): `F` (flagged)\n- Adjacent to (2,0): `1`\n- **Possible bomb:** If (1,0) is a bomb, it would satisfy the `1` at (2,0), which currently has no adjacent flags.\n\nSimilarly, cell (1,4): `.` (unexplored)\n- Adjacent to (1,3): `2` with one flag at (1,2)\n- **Possible bomb:** If (1,4) is a bomb, it would satisfy the `2` at (1,3) along with the flag at (1,2).\n\nGiven that, removing the flag at (1,1) might allow us to flag (1,0) or (1,4) as bombs, resolving the `2` at (1,3) and (2,1).\n\n**Decision:**\nRemove the flag at (1,1) to resolve the conflict at (0,2).\n\n### **Step 5: Making the Move**\n\nAfter removing the flag at (1,1), we can proceed to reveal safe tiles or place new flags based on the updated board state.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **Remove the flag at (1,1):**\n   - **Move:** x=1, y=1, flag=true (to remove the flag)\n   \n2. **After removing the flag, reassess the board:**\n   - **Cell (0,2):** Now has one adjacent flag at (1,2), which matches the `1`.\n   - **Cell (1,3):** Still needs one more bomb adjacent.\n   - **Cell (2,1):** Still needs one more bomb adjacent.\n\n3. **Identify safe moves:**\n   - **Cell (1,0):** Unexplored, potentially a bomb.\n   - **Cell (1,4):** Unexplored, potentially a bomb.\n   - **Cell (2,2):** Flagged, assumed bomb.\n\n4. **Decide to reveal a safe tile:**\n   - **Cell (3,2):** Adjacent to (3,1): `1` with no adjacent flags. Since (3,1) indicates `1` and has no adjacent flags, the adjacent unexplored cells should have one bomb.\n   - **Adjacent cells to (3,1):** (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2)\n   - **Flagged adjacent cells:** (2,2)\n   - **Analysis:** Since (3,1) indicates `1` and there's already a flag at (2,2), there should be no other bombs adjacent. Therefore, (3,2) is safe to reveal.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nAfter removing the flag at (1,1), the tile at (3,2) is safe to reveal.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** \nRemoving the flag at (1,1) resolves the inconsistency at (0,2) where a `1` had two adjacent flags. After removal, the tile at (3,2) is revealed as safe since its adjacent numbered cell (3,1) indicates only one bomb, which is already covered by the flag at (2,2).\n\n**MOVE:** 3,2,false", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 2 1 1 . . . . . .\n1 .

Since both flags are adjacent to tile (0,1), which shows '2' and has two adjacent flags (both correct), we need to determine which flag is causing the conflict in tile (0,2).\n\n2. **Tile (1,3) - Value: 2**\n   - **Issue:** Three adjacent flags ((1,2), (1,4), (2,2)), but the tile shows '2'.\n   - **Solution:** One of these flags must be incorrect.\n\n3. **Tile (2,1) - Value: 2**\n   - **Issue:** Three adjacent flags ((1,1), (1,2), (2,2)), but the tile shows '2'.\n   - **Solution:** One of these flags must be incorrect.\n\nTo resolve these conflicts, we'll examine each conflicting flag's impact on other tiles.\n\n#### Analyzing Flag (1,1):\n\n**Adjacent Tiles to (1,1):**\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n**Impact:**\n- **Tile (0,1) - Value: 2:** Has two adjacent flags ((1,1) and (1,2)) \u2014 correct.\n- **Tile (0,2) - Value: 1:** Has two adjacent flags ((1,1) and (1,2)) \u2014 conflict.\n  \n**Conclusion:** Flag (1,1) is causing a conflict in tile (0,2).

It's possible that flag (1,4) is incorrectly placed.\n\n#### Analyzing Flag (2,2):\n\n**Adjacent Tiles to (2,2):**\n- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n**Impact:**\n- **Tile (1,3) - Value: 2:** Has three adjacent flags ((1,2), (1,4), (2,2)) \u2014 conflict.\n- **Tile (2,1) - Value: 2:** Has three adjacent flags ((1,1), (1,2), (2,2)) \u2014 conflict.\n  \n**Conclusion:** Flag (2,2) is causing conflicts in tiles (1,3) and (2,1). It's possible that flag (2,2) is incorrectly placed.\n\n### Step 4: Determining Which Flags to Remove\n\nGiven the conflicts, we need to determine which flags are likely incorrect. Let's consider the following:\n\n1. **Flag (1,1):** Causes conflict in tile (0,2).\n2. **Flag (1,2):** Causes conflicts in tiles (0,2) and (1,3).\n3. **Flag (1,4):** Causes conflict in tile (1,3).\n4. **Flag (2,2):** Causes conflicts in tiles (1,3) and (2,1).\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to remove the flags that are causing multiple conflicts. Removing flag (1,2) would resolve conflicts in both tile (0,2) and tile (1,3). Similarly, removing flag (2,2) would resolve conflicts in tile (1,3) and tile (2,1).\n\nHowever, removing flag (1,2) affects more tiles positively. Let's explore removing flag (1,2).\n\n#### Scenario: Removing Flag (1,2)\n\n**Impact on Tile (0,1) - Value: 2:**\n- Adjacent flags: (1,1) \u2014 now only one flag.\n- **Issue:** The tile shows '2', but now has only one adjacent flag.\n- **Conclusion:** There must be another bomb adjacent to tile (0,1).\n\n**Impact on Tile (0,2) - Value: 1:**\n- Adjacent flags: (1,1) \u2014 now only one flag.\n- **Issue:** The tile shows '1', and there is one adjacent flag.\n- **Conclusion:** No conflict here.\n\n**Impact on Tile (1,3) - Value: 2:**\n- Adjacent flags: (1,4), (2,2) \u2014 now two flags.\n- **Conclusion:** The tile shows '2', and there are two adjacent flags. No conflict here.\n\n**Impact on Tile (2,1) - Value: 2:**\n- Adjacent flags: (1,1), (2,2) \u2014 now two flags.\n- **Conclusion:** The tile shows '2', and there are two adjacent flags. No conflict here.\n\n**New Board State After Removing Flag (1,2):**\n\n```\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 [1][2][1][1][.][.][.][.][.][.]\n1 [.][F][.][2][F][.][.][.][.][.]\n2 [1][2][F][.][.][.][.][.][.][.]\n3 [1][1][2][.][.][.][.][.][.][.]\n4 [.][2][1][1][.][.][.][.][.][.]\n5 [.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.]\n6 [.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.]\n7 [.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.]\n8 [.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.]\n9 [.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.][.]\n```\n\n**Flags Remaining:** 7 (since we removed one flag)\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the New Board State\n\nLet's verify that removing flag (1,2) has resolved all conflicts.\n\n**Tile (0,1) - Value: 2:**\n- Adjacent flags: (1,1)\n- Number of flags: 1\n- **Conclusion:** There must be one more bomb adjacent to this tile.\n\n**Tile (0,2) - Value: 1:**\n- Adjacent flags: (1,1)\n- Number of flags: 1\n- **Conclusion:** No conflict here.\n\n**Tile (1,3) - Value: 2:**\n- Adjacent flags: (1,4), (2,2)\n- Number of flags: 2\n- **Conclusion:** No conflict here.\n\n**Tile (2,1) - Value: 2:**\n- Adjacent flags: (1,1), (2,2)\n- Number of flags: 2\n- **Conclusion:** No conflict here.\n\nAll previous conflicts have been resolved by removing flag (1,2).\n\n### Step 6: Determining the Next Move\n\nNow that the conflicts are resolved, we can proceed to make the next move. Let's look for tiles where we can safely reveal a tile or place a new flag.\n\n#### Analyzing Tile (0,1) - Value: 2:\n\n**Adjacent Unexplored Tiles:**\n- (0,0): Already revealed as '1'.\n- (1,0): Unexplored (.)\n- (1,1): Flagged (F)\n- (1,2): Unexplored (.)\n\n**Number of Bombs Needed:** 2\n**Existing Flags:** 1 (at (1,1))\n**Therefore:** There must be one more bomb among (1,0) and (1,2).\n\nLet's examine these tiles:\n\n**Tile (1,0):**\n- Adjacent to tile (0,0) - Value: 1\n- Tile (0,0) - Value: 1: Adjacent tiles: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n- Existing flags: (1,1)\n- Number of flags: 1\n- **Conclusion:** Tile (0,0) shows '1' and has one adjacent flag at (1,1). Therefore, there are no more bombs adjacent to tile (0,0). Hence, tile (1,0) is safe to reveal.\n\n**Tile (1,2):**\n- Adjacent to tile (0,1) - Value: 2: Needs one more bomb.\n- Adjacent to tile (0,2) - Value: 1: Has one adjacent flag at (1,1).\n- **Conclusion:** Since tile (0,1) needs one more bomb adjacent, and tile (1,2) is a candidate, it's likely that tile (1,2) contains a bomb. However, we should verify this.\n\n**Verifying Tile (1,2):**\n- If we place a flag at (1,2), we need to ensure it doesn't create new conflicts.\n\n**Impact of Placing Flag at (1,2):**\n\n**Tile (0,1) - Value: 2:**\n- Adjacent flags: (1,1), (1,2)\n- Number of flags: 2\n- **Conclusion:** Matches the tile's value. No conflict.\n\n**Tile (0,2) - Value: 1:**\n- Adjacent flags: (1,1), (1,2)\n- Number of flags: 2\n- **Issue:** The tile shows '1', but there would be two adjacent flags. Conflict arises.\n\nTherefore, placing a flag at (1,2) would cause a conflict in tile (0,2). Hence, tile (1,2) cannot be a bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:** Tile (1,2) is safe to reveal.\n\n### Step 7: Final Decision\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n\n- **Tile (1,0):** Safe to reveal.\n- **Tile (1,2):** Safe to reveal.\n\nSince both tiles are safe, we can choose to reveal either one. Revealing tile (1,0) would be a straightforward move as it's directly adjacent to tile (0,0), which already indicates it's safe.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Removing the incorrectly placed flag at (1,2) resolved conflicts in multiple tiles. Analyzing adjacent tiles to tile (0,1) revealed that tile (1,0) is safe to reveal, as tile (0,0) indicates no additional bombs are adjacent.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,0,false\n\nThis move reveals tile (1,0), which is safe based on the current board state and the resolution of the earlier conflicts.", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 2 1 1 . . . . . .\n1 .
