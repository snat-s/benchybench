{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs, and I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after making this move, the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '3'. That means there are 3 bombs adjacent to this cell. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nSince it's my first move and I have no other information, I should flag the cells that are likely to be bombs based on this number. But I need to be careful not to overflag or underflag.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total, I need to use them wisely. Each flag I place should be as accurate as possible.\n\nLet's say I decide to flag three cells adjacent to the '3'. But which three? I need to look at the board and see if any of these adjacent cells are already revealed or have numbers that can give me more information.\n\nAssuming that no other cells are revealed yet, I can choose to flag any three of the eight adjacent cells. For now, I'll choose to flag (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5).\n\nSo, my next moves would be:\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\n\nMOVE: 3,4,true\n\nMOVE: 4,3,true\n\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged three cells, and I have 7 flags left. Next, I should reveal another cell that is not adjacent to the initial reveal to try to expand the board further.\n\nLet's choose (6,6) as another safe starting point.\n\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\n\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\nSuppose this reveals a '1'. Now, there is only one bomb adjacent to (6,6). The adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nI need to see if any of these are already flagged or revealed. Assuming none are flagged yet, I'll flag one of them, say (6,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\n\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged four cells, and I have 6 flags left.\n\nContinuing this process, I need to look for more numbers and adjust my flags accordingly. If I reveal a cell and it shows a '0', that means there are no bombs adjacent to it, and the game should automatically reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nLet's say I reveal (5,4) and it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nI already have flags on (4,3), (4,5), and (6,5). So, out of the eight adjacent cells to (5,4), three are flagged. The number '2' means only two of them are bombs. This suggests that one of the flagged cells is not a bomb, which is a conflict.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If '2' means exactly two adjacent bombs, and I have three flags on adjacent cells, then one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. Therefore, I need to remove one flag from the adjacent cells of (5,4).\n\nSo, I need to unflag one of the cells: (4,3), (4,5), or (6,5). But I need to choose wisely.\n\nLooking at the board, if I unflag (6,5), and assuming that (6,5) is not a bomb, then the '1' at (6,6) would still need one flag, so maybe (6,7) should be flagged.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (3,3). Suppose it shows a '1'. Adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nI have a flag on (3,4) and (4,3). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (3,3). But the '1' indicates only one adjacent bomb. Therefore, one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. So, I need to unflag one of them.\n\nThis suggests that either (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb. But earlier, based on the '3' at (4,4), I flagged (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5). Now, if one of (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb, then perhaps (4,5) is the actual bomb.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (5,5). Suppose it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nI have flags on (4,5) and (6,5). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (5,5). The '2' means exactly two bombs adjacent, so the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (4,6), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,6) safely.\n\nLet's reveal (4,6). Suppose it shows a '0'. Then, the game should auto-reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nNow, the board has expanded in that area, giving me more information.\n\nContinuing this process, revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers, I can progress through the game.\n\nIt's important to keep track of the number of flags left and the number of potential bombs still to be flagged.\n\nAlso, sometimes, I might need to make educated guesses when there isn't enough information to be certain, but that can be risky.\n\nIn summary, my strategy is to:\n\n1. Make initial safe moves to start revealing the board.\n\n2. Flag cells based on the numbers revealed, ensuring that the number of flags matches the numbers.\n\n3. Reveal cells that are likely safe based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\n4. Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n5. Continue this process until all bombs are flagged or all safe cells are revealed.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this Minesweeper problem, we need to methodically reveal safe cells and flag bombs based on the numbers revealed, which indicate how many bombs are adjacent to each cell. Here is a step-by-step approach to playing the game:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - The first move is safe, so choose a central cell to maximize the area revealed.\n   - Based on the number revealed, flag the appropriate number of adjacent cells as bombs.\n\n2. **Expand the Board**:\n   - Choose another safe cell away from the initial move to further expand the revealed area.\n   - Continue flagging cells based on the numbers revealed.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If a number indicates fewer bombs than the flags placed, remove flags accordingly.\n   - Ensure that the number of flags around each numbered cell matches the number shown.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n6. **Completion**:\n   - The game is won by either revealing all safe cells or correctly flagging all bombs.\n\n### Solution Code Structure\n\nSince Minesweeper is an interactive problem, the solution involves a series of moves based on the board's state, which is updated after each move. Therefore, the solution is presented as a sequence of moves with explanations.\n\n### Example Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\n# Move 1: Initial safe move at center\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '3'\n# Flag three adjacent cells\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\nMOVE: 3,4,true\nMOVE: 4,3,true\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\n# Move 2: Another safe move away from initial reveal\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '1'\n# Flag one adjacent cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\n# Move 3: Reveal a new cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another cell to get more information.\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '2'\n# Adjust flags based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Adjust flags around '2' at (5,4).\n# If conflict, unflag one cell\nMOVE: 4,5,false  # Unflag if necessary\n\n# Move 4: Reveal a safe cell based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a safe cell adjacent to '2'.\nMOVE: 4,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '0'\n# Auto-reveal neighbors\nEXPLANATION: '0' at (4,6), auto-revealing neighbors.\n\n# Continue this process until the game is solved.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - Start with a safe move at the center to maximize reveal.\n   - Flag adjacent cells based on the number revealed.\n\n2. **Expanding the Board**:\n   - Make another safe move away from the initial reveal to get more information.\n   - Flag cells accordingly based on new revelations.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If flags exceed the number indicated, remove flags from likely safe cells.\n   - Ensure consistency between flags and numbers.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust strategy as new information is revealed to avoid conflicts and progress towards solving the board.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left to find, with 10 flags remaining. That means I need to flag all 10 bombs to win.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. There are some revealed numbers and some empty spaces. The numbers tell me how many bombs are adjacent to those spaces. Adjacent means horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\nLet's look at the row where there are some numbers revealed. In row 1, column 6, there's a '2'. That means there are 2 bombs in the 8 surrounding squares. Next to it is a '1' in row 1, column 7, which means only 1 bomb in its adjacent squares. Then another '2' in row 1, column 8, and a '1' in row 1, column 9.\n\nLooking at row 2, columns 6 and below are empty or flagged. Similarly, row 3 and row 4 have some numbers and empty spaces.\n\nI need to be careful where I click next. I should look for places where I can deduce the exact location of a bomb or where it's safe to click.\n\nLet me start by looking at the '1' in row 1, column 7. It has a '2' to its left and a '1' to its right. Let's see its adjacent squares:\n\n- Above it: row 0, column 7 (unrevealed)\n- Left: row 1, column 6 ('2')\n- Below: row 2, column 7 (empty)\n- Right: row 1, column 8 ('2')\n- Diagonals: row 0, column 6; row 0, column 8; row 2, column 6; row 2, column 8\n\nNow, the '1' means only one of these adjacent squares has a bomb. Similarly, the '2' on its left has two bombs in its adjacent squares, and the '2' on its right also has two bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. Maybe I should look elsewhere for a clearer indication.\n\nLet's look at row 4, column 5, which has a '2'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: row 3, column 5 (empty)\n- Left: row 4, column 4 (unrevealed)\n- Below: row 5, column 5 (unrevealed)\n- Right: row 4, column 6 ('2')\n- Diagonals: row 3, column 4; row 3, column 6; row 5, column 4; row 5, column 6\n\nThe '2' here means two of these adjacent squares have bombs. Similarly, the '2' to its right in row 4, column 6, also has two bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nHmm, maybe if I consider both '2's together, I can find some overlap and deduce something.\n\nWait, let's consider that row 4, column 5's '2' and row 4, column 6's '2' share some adjacent squares: row 4, column 4; row 4, column 7; row 5, column 5; row 5, column 6; and the diagonals.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me try to look for areas where I can confirm the location of a bomb or where it's safe to click.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 7, there's a '2'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: row 6, column 7 ('1')\n- Left: row 7, column 6 (unrevealed)\n- Below: row 8, column 7 ('1')\n- Right: row 7, column 8 (unrevealed)\n- Diagonals: row 6, column 6; row 6, column 8; row 8, column 6; row 8, column 8\n\nThe '2' here means two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 7, which is a '1', it has:\n\n- Above: row 5, column 7 ('2')\n- Left: row 6, column 6 (unrevealed)\n- Below: row 7, column 7 ('2')\n- Right: row 6, column 8 (unrevealed)\n- Diagonals: row 5, column 6; row 5, column 8; row 7, column 6; row 7, column 8\n\nThe '1' means only one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nThis seems like a cluster, and it might be helpful to consider them together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that is only adjacent to one number, making it easier to determine if it's a bomb or safe.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 6, which is '2', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: row 0, column 6 (unrevealed)\n- Left: row 1, column 5 (unrevealed)\n- Below: row 2, column 6 (empty)\n- Right: row 1, column 7 ('1')\n- Diagonals: row 0, column 5; row 0, column 7; row 2, column 5; row 2, column 7\n\nThe '2' means two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 7, which is '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: row 0, column 7 (unrevealed)\n- Left: row 1, column 6 ('2')\n- Below: row 2, column 7 (empty)\n- Right: row 1, column 8 ('2')\n- Diagonals: row 0, column 6; row 0, column 8; row 2, column 6; row 2, column 8\n\nThe '1' means one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 8, which is '2', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: row 0, column 8 (unrevealed)\n- Left: row 1, column 7 ('1')\n- Below: row 2, column 8 (empty)\n- Right: row 1, column 9 ('1')\n- Diagonals: row 0, column 7; row 0, column 9; row 2, column 7; row 2, column 9\n\nThe '2' means two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 9, which is '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: row 0, column 9 (unrevealed)\n- Left: row 1, column 8 ('2')\n- Below: row 2, column 9 (empty)\n- Right: row 1, column 10 (out of bounds)\n- Diagonals: row 0, column 8; row 0, column 10 (out of bounds); row 2, column 8; row 2, column 10 (out of bounds)\n\nThe '1' means one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nSo, for row 1, column 9 ('1'), its adjacent squares are:\n\n- row 0, column 9\n- row 1, column 8 ('2')\n- row 2, column 9\n- row 0, column 8\n- row 2, column 8\n\nBut row 1, column 8 is a '2', which already has two bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the overlap between these numbers.\n\nLet me try to visualize the adjacent squares:\n\n- row 0, columns 6 to 9: all unrevealed\n- row 1, columns 5 to 9: 'unrevealed', 'unrevealed', '2', '1', '2', '1'\n- row 2, columns 5 to 9: 'unrevealed', 'empty', 'empty', 'empty', 'empty'\n\nHmm, this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total number of bombs and flags left. There are 10 bombs left, and I have 10 flags remaining. So, I need to place exactly 10 flags on bombs.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't place a flag on a safe square, or I'll run out of flags before marking all the bombs.\n\nAlternatively, if I place a flag on a safe square, I won't have enough flags for the remaining bombs.\n\nSo, I need to be precise with where I place the flags.\n\nLooking back at the board, I see that in row 2 and row 3, there are some empty spaces, which mean those squares are safe, but they don't have any adjacent bombs.\n\nWait, no. An empty space ('_') means it's a safe square with no adjacent bombs.\n\nSo, in row 2 and row 3, columns 6 and above are empty, meaning those squares have no adjacent bombs.\n\nThat could be useful.\n\nLet me see: if I have empty squares, and they are adjacent to numbered squares, that can help me determine where the bombs are.\n\nWait, actually, empty squares indicate that none of the adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nSo, for example, in row 2, column 6, which is empty, means that none of its adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: row 1, column 6 ('2')\n- Left: row 2, column 5 (unrevealed)\n- Below: row 3, column 6 (empty)\n- Right: row 2, column 7 (empty)\n- Diagonals: row 1, column 5; row 1, column 7; row 3, column 5; row 3, column 7\n\nSince this square is empty, none of these adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, row 3, column 6 is also empty, so none of its adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nThis can help me determine that certain squares are safe or must have bombs.\n\nLet me try to use this information.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 6, which is empty, its adjacent squares have no bombs.\n\nSo, row 1, column 6 is '2', but since row 2, column 6 is empty, none of its adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If row 2, column 6 is empty, meaning no adjacent bombs, but row 1, column 6 is '2', which indicates two adjacent bombs.\n\nBut row 1, column 6 is adjacent to row 2, column 6, which is safe, so row 1, column 6 must have its bombs in other adjacent squares.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me think carefully.\n\nIf row 2, column 6 is empty, that means none of its adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- row 1, column 5\n- row 1, column 6\n- row 1, column 7\n- row 2, column 5\n- row 2, column 7\n- row 3, column 5\n- row 3, column 6\n- row 3, column 7\n\nNone of these squares have bombs.\n\nBut row 1, column 6 is a '2', which should have two adjacent bombs.\n\nWait, but row 1, column 6 is adjacent to:\n\n- row 0, column 5\n- row 0, column 6\n- row 0, column 7\n- row 1, column 5\n- row 1, column 7\n- row 2, column 5\n- row 2, column 6\n- row 2, column 7\n\nBut row 2, column 6 is safe, so no bomb there.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 5 and row 2, column 7 are also adjacent to row 2, column 6, which is safe, so they can't have bombs.\n\nWait, no, row 2, column 5 and row 2, column 7 are adjacent to row 2, column 6, which is safe, but they could still have bombs if they are not adjacent to any empty squares.\n\nWait, no, if row 2, column 6 is empty, meaning none of its adjacent squares have bombs, then row 2, column 5 and row 2, column 7 cannot have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 5 and row 1, column 7 cannot have bombs.\n\nAnd row 3, column 5 and row 3, column 7 cannot have bombs.\n\nSo, for row 1, column 6, which is '2', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- row 0, column 5\n- row 0, column 6\n- row 0, column 7\n- row 1, column 5\n- row 1, column 7\n- row 2, column 5\n- row 2, column 6\n- row 2, column 7\n\nBut row 2, column 5, row 2, column 6, and row 2, column 7 cannot have bombs, as row 2, column 6 is empty.\n\nAlso, row 1, column 5 and row 1, column 7 are adjacent to row 2, column 6, which is empty, so they cannot have bombs.\n\nTherefore, the only possible squares for the two bombs adjacent to row 1, column 6 are row 0, column 5; row 0, column 6; and row 0, column 7.\n\nWait, but that's three squares, and row 1, column 6 needs exactly two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nSo, two out of those three squares must have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 7 is '1', which needs one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- row 0, column 6\n- row 0, column 7\n- row 0, column 8\n- row 1, column 6 ('2')\n- row 1, column 8 ('2')\n- row 2, column 6 (empty)\n- row 2, column 7 (empty)\n- row 2, column 8 (empty)\n\nBut row 2, column 6, row 2, column 7, and row 2, column 8 are all empty, meaning no bombs adjacent to them.\n\nTherefore, none of their adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nWait, but row 2, column 7 is empty, so none of its adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- row 1, column 6 ('2')\n- row 1, column 7 ('1')\n- row 1, column 8 ('2')\n- row 2, column 6 (empty)\n- row 2, column 8 (empty)\n- row 3, column 6 (empty)\n- row 3, column 7 (empty)\n- row 3, column 8 (empty)\n\nSo, none of these have bombs.\n\nBut row 1, column 7 is '1', which needs one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- row 0, column 6\n- row 0, column 7\n- row 0, column 8\n- row 1, column 6 ('2')\n- row 1, column 8 ('2')\n- row 2, column 6 (empty)\n- row 2, column 7 (empty)\n- row 2, column 8 (empty)\n\nSince row 2, column 6, row 2, column 7, and row 2, column 8 have no adjacent bombs, that doesn't directly affect this.\n\nSo, for row 1, column 7's '1', it must have exactly one bomb in:\n\n- row 0, column 6\n- row 0, column 7\n- row 0, column 8\n- row 1, column 6 ('2')\n- row 1, column 8 ('2')\n\nBut row 1, column 6 is '2', which is already accounted for with its own bombs.\n\nWait, I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the possible bomb locations based on the '2' in row 1, column 6 and the '1' in row 1, column 7.\n\nFrom earlier, for row 1, column 6 '2', the possible bomb locations are row 0, column 5; row 0, column 6; row 0, column 7.\n\nSimilarly, for row 1, column 7 '1', the possible bomb locations are row 0, column 6; row 0, column 7; row 0, column 8.\n\nSo, row 1, column 6 '2' needs two bombs from row 0, column 5; row 0, column 6; row 0, column 7.\n\nRow 1, column 7 '1' needs one bomb from row 0, column 6; row 0, column 7; row 0, column 8.\n\nLet me see if I can find a combination that satisfies both.\n\nIf I place bombs in row 0, column 5 and row 0, column 7, then row 1, column 6 '2' is satisfied (bombs in row 0, column 5 and row 0, column 7).\n\nThen, row 1, column 7 '1' would have only one bomb in row 0, column 7, which satisfies its '1'.\n\nAlternatively, if I place bombs in row 0, column 6 and row 0, column 7, then row 1, column 6 '2' is satisfied (bombs in row 0, column 6 and row 0, column 7).\n\nRow 1, column 7 '1' would have bombs in row 0, column 6 and row 0, column 7, but it only needs one bomb. Wait, no, it needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nWait, but row 1, column 7 is adjacent to row 0, column 6; row 0, column 7; row 0, column 8; row 1, column 6; row 1, column 8; row 2, column 6; row 2, column 7; row 2, column 8.\n\nBut row 2, column 6, row 2, column 7, and row 2, column 8 are empty, meaning no bombs adjacent to them.\n\nSo, for row 1, column 7 '1', it can only have one bomb in row 0, column 6; row 0, column 7; row 0, column 8.\n\nIf I place bombs in row 0, column 5 and row 0, column 7, then row 1, column 7 '1' would see only row 0, column 7, which is one bomb, satisfying its '1'.\n\nSimilarly, if I place bombs in row 0, column 6 and row 0, column 7, then row 1, column 7 '1' would see two bombs in row 0, column 6 and row 0, column 7, which would violate its '1'.\n\nWait, no, the '1' allows only one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nSo, placing two bombs adjacent to it would violate that.\n\nTherefore, I cannot place bombs in both row 0, column 6 and row 0, column 7.\n\nSo, only the first option is valid: bombs in row 0, column 5 and row 0, column 7.\n\nSimilarly, for row 1, column 8 '2', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- row 0, column 7\n- row 0, column 8\n- row 0, column 9\n- row 1, column 7 ('1')\n- row 1, column 9 ('1')\n- row 2, column 7 (empty)\n- row 2, column 8 (empty)\n- row 2, column 9 (empty)\n\nRow 2, column 7, row 2, column 8, and row 2, column 9 are empty, meaning no bombs adjacent to them.\n\nSo, for row 1, column 8 '2', it must have two bombs in:\n\n- row 0, column 7\n- row 0, column 8\n- row 0, column 9\n\nFrom earlier, row 0, column 7 is likely to have a bomb (from the previous deduction).\n\nSo, if row 0, column 7 has a bomb, then row 1, column 8 '2' needs another bomb in row 0, column 8 or row 0, column 9.\n\nBut row 1, column 9 is '1', which needs one bomb in its adjacent squares:\n\n- row 0, column 8\n- row 0, column 9\n- row 1, column 8 ('2')\n- row 2, column 8 (empty)\n- row 2, column 9 (empty)\n\nRow 2, column 8 and row 2, column 9 are empty, meaning no bombs adjacent to them.\n\nSo, for row 1, column 9 '1', it can only have one bomb in row 0, column 8 or row 0, column 9.\n\nNow, considering row 1, column 8 '2' needs two bombs in row 0, column 7; row 0, column 8; row 0, column 9.\n\nBut row 0, column 7 is already supposed to have a bomb from earlier.\n\nSo, it needs another bomb in row 0, column 8 or row 0, column 9.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 9 '1' needs one bomb in row 0, column 8 or row 0, column 9.\n\nSo, if row 0, column 7 has a bomb, then row 1, column 8 '2' needs one more bomb in row 0, column 8 or row 0, column 9.\n\nBut row 1, column 9 '1' needs only one bomb in row 0, column 8 or row 0, column 9.\n\nSo, to satisfy both, only one bomb can be placed in row 0, column 8 or row 0, column 9.\n\nTherefore, row 0, column 8 and row 0, column 9 must have exactly one bomb between them.\n\nSo, possible scenarios:\n\n- row 0, column 8 has a bomb, row 0, column 9 is safe\n- row 0, column 9 has a bomb, row 0, column 8 is safe\n\nBut not both, because row 1, column 9 '1' only allows one bomb.\n\nWait, but row 1, column 8 '2' needs two bombs: one in row 0, column 7 (already placed), and one in either row 0, column 8 or row 0, column 9.\n\nRow 1, column 9 '1' needs one bomb in row 0, column 8 or row 0, column 9.\n\nSo, if I place a bomb in row 0, column 8, then both row 1, column 8 '2' and row 1, column 9 '1' are satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, if I place a bomb in row 0, column 9, then both are also satisfied.\n\nBut I can't place bombs in both row 0, column 8 and row 0, column 9, because that would make row 1, column 9 '1' have two adjacent bombs, which violates its value.\n\nTherefore, exactly one of row 0, column 8 or row 0, column 9 must have a bomb.\n\nNow, looking back, row 0, column 5 and row 0, column 7 must have bombs, and one of row 0, column 8 or row 0, column 9 must have a bomb.\n\nSo, that's three bombs so far: row 0, column 5; row 0, column 7; and one of row 0, column 8 or row 0, column 9.\n\nBut we have 10 bombs in total, so there are more bombs elsewhere.\n\nLooking elsewhere on the board, in row 4, column 5, there's a '2', and row 4, column 6 has a '2'.\n\nLet's see what we can deduce from there.\n\nRow 4, column 5 '2' has adjacent squares:\n\n- row 3, column 5 (empty)\n- row 4, column 4 (unrevealed)\n- row 5, column 5 (unrevealed)\n- row 4, column 6 ('2')\n- row 3, column 4 (unrevealed)\n- row 3, column 6 (unrevealed)\n- row 5, column 4 (unrevealed)\n- row 5, column 6 (unrevealed)\n\nThe '2' means two of these adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, row 4, column 6 '2' has adjacent squares:\n\n- row 3, column 6 (unrevealed)\n- row 4, column 5 ('2')\n- row 5, column 6 (unrevealed)\n- row 4, column 7 (unrevealed)\n- row 3, column 5 (empty)\n- row 3, column 7 (unrevealed)\n- row 5, column 5 (unrevealed)\n- row 5, column 7 (unrevealed)\n\nIts '2' also means two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5, which is unrevealed, adjacent to both '2's.\n\nThis seems like a more complex area, and I might need to consider multiple possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a square that is safe to click based on the current information.\n\nLooking back at row 3, column 5, which is empty, meaning no adjacent bombs.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- row 2, column 4\n- row 2, column 5\n- row 2, column 6 (empty)\n- row 3, column 4\n- row 3, column 6 (empty)\n- row 4, column 4 (unrevealed)\n- row 4, column 5 ('2')\n- row 4, column 6 ('2')\n\nSince it's empty, none of these adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nSo, row 2, column 4, row 2, column 5, row 3, column 4, row 4, column 4, row 4, column 5, and row 4, column 6 are all safe.\n\nWait, but row 4, column 5 is '2', which indicates bombs adjacent to it.\n\nBut since row 3, column 5 is empty, none of its adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nWait, no, row 3, column 5 being empty means none of its adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nBut row 4, column 5 is adjacent to row 3, column 5, so row 4, column 5 cannot have a bomb.\n\nBut row 4, column 5 is '2', which means it's a numbered square, not a bomb.\n\nSo, the bombs must be in its other adjacent squares.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nIf row 3, column 5 is empty, meaning no bombs adjacent to it, then row 4, column 5 cannot have a bomb.\n\nBut row 4, column 5 is '2', which is a numbered square indicating two adjacent bombs.\n\nSo, the bombs must be in the other adjacent squares to row 4, column 5.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- row 3, column 5 (empty)\n- row 4, column 4 (unrevealed)\n- row 5, column 5 (unrevealed)\n- row 4, column 6 ('2')\n- row 3, column 4 (unrevealed)\n- row 3, column 6 (empty)\n- row 5, column 4 (unrevealed)\n- row 5, column 6 (unrevealed)\n\nSince row 3, column 5 is empty, none of its adjacent squares have bombs, which includes row 4, column 5.\n\nBut row 4, column 5 is '2', which needs two bombs in its adjacent squares, excluding itself.\n\nSo, the bombs must be in row 4, column 4; row 5, column 5; row 5, column 4; or row 5, column 6.\n\nBut row 3, column 4 and row 3, column 6 are adjacent to row 3, column 5, which is empty, so they cannot have bombs.\n\nTherefore, the two bombs adjacent to row 4, column 5 must be in row 4, column 4; row 5, column 4; row 5, column 5; or row 5, column 6.\n\nSimilarly, row 4, column 6 '2' has adjacent squares:\n\n- row 3, column 6 (empty)\n- row 4, column 5 ('2')\n- row 5, column 6 (unrevealed)\n- row 4, column 7 (unrevealed)\n- row 3, column 5 (empty)\n- row 3, column 7 (unrevealed)\n- row 5, column 5 (unrevealed)\n- row 5, column 7 (unrevealed)\n\nIts '2' means two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut row 3, column 6 is empty, so none of its adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nTherefore, row 4, column 5 ('2'), row 4, column 7 (unrevealed), row 5, column 5 (unrevealed), row 5, column 6 (unrevealed), and row 5, column 7 (unrevealed) could have bombs.\n\nWait, but row 4, column 5 is '2', which is not a bomb.\n\nSo, for row 4, column 6 '2', the bombs must be in row 5, column 5; row 5, column 6; row 5, column 7; or row 4, column 7.\n\nBut row 5, column 5 and row 5, column 6 are adjacent to both row 4, column 5 and row 4, column 6.\n\nThis is getting quite involved.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that row 5, column 5 and row 5, column 6 are both adjacent to two '2's, so they might be bombs.\n\nBut I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that must be safe to click.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4, which is adjacent to row 3, column 5 (empty), so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 4, column 4 is adjacent to row 3, column 5 (empty), so it's safe.\n\nSo, I can safely click row 4, column 4.\n\nLet me try that.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Row 3, column 5 is empty, meaning no adjacent bombs. Therefore, row 4, column 4 is safe to click.\n\n**MOVE:** 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . 2 1 2 1\n2 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n3 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n4 . . . . . 2 2 _ _ _\n5 . . . . . . 2 1 _ _\n6 . . . . . . . 1 _ _\n7 . . . . . . . 2 1 _\n8 . . . . . . . . 1 _\n9 . . . . . . . . 1 _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left to find, with 10 flags remaining. That means I need to flag all 10 remaining bombs to win.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the numbers and see where the bombs could be. Let's start from the top left and scan row by row.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n0: _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n\nColumn 4 has a '1', which means there is exactly one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nBut (0,5) is a '.', which means it's unexplored, and (1,5) is a '1' in the next row. Wait, no, in row 1, column 5 is a '1'.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nRow 0: positions (0,0) to (0,9)\n\nRow 1: positions (1,0) to (1,9)\n\nSo for (0,4), which is '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nNow, (0,3) is '_', which is empty revealed space, so no bomb there.\n\n(0,5) is '.', unexplored.\n\n(1,3) is '_', empty revealed space.\n\n(1,4) is '1'.\n\n(1,5) is '1'.\n\nSo, only (0,5) and possibly (1,5) could have bombs, but (1,5) is a '1', which means it has exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\nWait, (1,5) is '1', and its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nBut (0,4) is '1', (0,5) is '.', (0,6) is '.', (1,4) is '1', (1,6) is '2', (2,4) is '1', (2,5) is '.', (2,6) is '_'\n\nSo, (1,5) '1' must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. But (0,4) is '1', which already suggests that its adjacent bombs are limited.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at another part of the board.\n\nLet's look at row 1:\n\n1: _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 1 2 1\n\nSo, column 5 is '.', column 6 is '2', column 7 is '1', column 8 is '2', column 9 is '1'.\n\nLooking at (1,6): '2', which means two adjacent bombs.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n\nBut (0,5) is '.', (0,6) is '.', (0,7) is '.', (1,5) is '.', (1,7) is '1', (2,5) is '.', (2,6) is '_', (2,7) is '_'\n\nSo, out of these, the unexplored squares are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n\nBut (2,6) is '_', which is empty, so no bomb there.\n\nSo, possible bomb locations are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (2,5), (2,7)\n\nBut (1,6) requires exactly two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (1,7) is '1', which must have exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\nBut (0,6) is '.', (0,7) is '.', (0,8) is '_', (1,6) is '2', (1,8) is '1', (2,6) is '_', (2,7) is '_', (2,8) is '_'\n\nSo, only (0,6), (0,7), possibly (1,5), but need to correlate.\n\nThis seems a bit too complicated. Maybe I should look for a area with more information.\n\nLet's look at row 4:\n\n4: _ _ _ _ 2 2 2 _ _ _\n\nSo, columns 4,5,6 have '2's.\n\nLooking at (4,4): '2', adjacent squares:\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nBut (3,3) is '_', (3,4) is '_', (3,5) is '_', (4,3) is '_', (4,5) is '2', (5,3) is '1', (5,4) is '1', (5,5) is '1'\n\nSo, out of these, only (4,5) is '2', which is another '2', but it's already revealed.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the group of '2's together.\n\nLooking at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6): all '2's.\n\nTheir adjacent squares overlap, so I need to see how the bombs can be placed to satisfy all three '2's.\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's check row 5:\n\n5: 1 1 _ _ 1 . 2 1 _ _\n\nSo, columns 0,1,4 have '1's, columns 6,7 have '2','1'.\n\nLooking at (5,0): '1', adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1), (5,-1) [out of bounds]\n\nSo, only (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1)\n\nBut (4,0) is '_', (4,1) is '_', (5,1) is '1', (6,0) is '.', (6,1) is '1'\n\nSo, (5,0) '1' must have exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) '1' has adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,1), (6,2), (5,0)\n\nWhich are (4,1) '_', (4,2) '_', (5,2) '_', (6,1) '1', (6,2) '_', (5,0) '1'\n\nSo, (5,1) '1' must have exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nThis seems a bit tangled. Maybe I should look for a cell where the number of possible bomb locations matches the number required.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 6: '2', with adjacent unexplored squares being (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (2,5), (2,7)\n\nBut (2,6) is '_', so no bomb there.\n\nSo, possible bomb locations are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (2,5), (2,7)\n\nBut (1,6) requires exactly two bombs in these squares.\n\nSimilarly, (1,7) '1' requires exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares, which include some of these.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to find a square that is safe to click or a bomb to flag based on the current information.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n2: _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n\nSo, columns 4 and 6 have '1's.\n\nLooking at (2,4): '1', adjacent squares:\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nWhich are (1,3) '_', (1,4) '1', (1,5) '.', (2,3) '_', (2,5) '.', (3,3) '_', (3,4) '_', (3,5) '.'\n\nSo, possible bomb locations are (2,5), (3,5)\n\nBut (2,4) '1' requires exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6): '1', adjacent squares:\n\n- (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n\nWhich are (1,5) '.', (1,6) '2', (1,7) '1', (2,5) '.', (2,7) '_', (3,5) '.', (3,6) '_', (3,7) '_'\n\nSo, possible bomb locations are (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)\n\nBut (2,6) '1' requires exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at both (2,4) and (2,6), both require exactly one bomb in their adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at (2,5), which is adjacent to both, if I can determine if it has a bomb or not, that might help.\n\nIf I flag (2,5), does it satisfy both '1's?\n\nIf (2,5) is a bomb, then (2,4) '1' would have its bomb in (2,5), and (2,6) '1' would also have its bomb in (2,5). But (2,6) '1' has other possible bomb locations like (1,5) and (3,5). So, if (2,5) is a bomb, then (2,6) '1' would already have its bomb, so no other bombs in its adjacent squares, meaning (1,5), (3,5), etc., cannot have bombs.\n\nBut (1,5) is '.', and (3,5) is '.'.\n\nWait, but (1,5) is '.', which is adjacent to (1,6) '2', which requires two bombs.\n\nIf (2,5) is a bomb, then (1,6) '2' would have one bomb in (2,5), and needs another bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nThe other adjacent squares to (1,6) are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n\nIf (2,5) is a bomb, then it has one bomb, needs another.\n\nPossible locations: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (2,7)\n\nBut (2,6) is '_', no bomb there.\n\nSo, one bomb needed in (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (2,7)\n\nIf I flag (2,5), then (1,6) '2' would need one more bomb in these squares.\n\nBut (2,5) being a bomb satisfies both (2,4) '1' and (2,6) '1'.\n\nSimilarly, if I flag (2,5), then (1,6) '2' still needs one more bomb in (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (2,7)\n\nBut (1,5) is '.', and (0,5) is '.', (0,6) is '.', (0,7) is '.', (2,7) is '_'\n\nSo, I need to place one more bomb in these squares.\n\nBut I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs remaining, so I need to use all 10 flags.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to place a flag where there isn't a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (2,5) isn't a bomb.\n\nLet's consider if (2,5) is not a bomb.\n\nThen, (2,4) '1' needs its bomb in other adjacent squares, like (2,3) '_', (3,5) '.', etc.\n\nWait, but (2,3) is '_', no bomb there.\n\nSo, only (3,5) '.' could be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) '1' would need a bomb in its adjacent squares: (1,5).', (3,5).', or (2,7) '_'\n\nBut (2,7) is '_', no bomb.\n\nSo, if (2,5) is not a bomb, then both (2,4) and (2,6) '1's would require bombs in (3,5) and (1,5), but that might not satisfy (1,6) '2', which needs two bombs.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look at another part of the board.\n\nLet's look at row 7:\n\n7: . 2 1 _ _ 1 . 2 1 _\n\nSo, columns 1,2,5,7,8 have numbers.\n\nLooking at (7,1): '2', adjacent squares:\n\n- (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n\nWhich are (6,0) '.', (6,1) '1', (6,2) '_', (7,0) '.', (7,2) '1', (8,0) '.', (8,1) '2', (8,2) '1'\n\nSo, possible bomb locations are (6,0), (7,0), maybe others.\n\nBut (7,1) '2' needs exactly two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (7,2) '1' needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)\n\nWhich are (6,1) '1', (6,2) '_', (6,3) '_', (7,1) '2', (7,3) '_', (8,1) '2', (8,2) '1', (8,3) '_'\n\nSo, (7,2) '1' needs exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nThis seems another complex area.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that is definitely safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0: '_', which is already revealed.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 1: '_', revealed.\n\nRow 0, column 2: '_', revealed.\n\nRow 0, column 3: '_', revealed.\n\nRow 0, column 4: '1', revealed.\n\nRow 0, column 5: '.', unexplored.\n\nRow 0, column 6: '.', unexplored.\n\nRow 0, column 7: '.', unexplored.\n\nRow 0, column 8: '.', unexplored.\n\nRow 0, column 9: '.', unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 has some revealed and unexplored squares.\n\nMaybe I should try to reveal a square that is less likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 2: '1', which has adjacent squares:\n\n- (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3) [but row 10 doesn't exist]\n\nSo, adjacent squares are (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3)\n\nWhich are (8,1) '2', (8,2) '1', (8,3) '_', (9,1) '.', (9,3) '_'\n\nSo, (9,2) '1' needs exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at these, (9,1) is '.', unexplored, and (9,3) is '_', no bomb.\n\nSo, possible bomb is in (9,1).\n\nBut I have to be careful.\n\nIf I flag (9,1), does it satisfy (9,2) '1'?\n\nYes, because (9,2) '1' would have its one bomb in (9,1).\n\nSimilarly, (8,1) '2' needs two bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares to (8,1) '2':\n\n- (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\nWhich are (7,0) '.', (7,1) '2', (7,2) '1', (8,0) '.', (8,2) '1', (9,0) '.', (9,1) '.', (9,2) '1'\n\nSo, (8,1) '2' needs two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nIf I flag (9,1), then one bomb is accounted for, needing one more in (7,0), (8,0), or other unflagged squares adjacent to (8,1).\n\nBut I have to be careful not to overflag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (8,0) is a bomb.\n\nIf I flag (8,0), then (8,1) '2' would have two bombs in (8,0) and (9,1), satisfying its requirement.\n\nBut I need to verify if this conflicts with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (8,2) '1', adjacent squares:\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3)\n\nWhich are (7,1) '2', (7,2) '1', (7,3) '_', (8,1) '2', (8,3) '_', (9,1) '.', (9,2) '1', (9,3) '_'\n\nSo, (8,2) '1' needs exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nIf (8,0) and (9,1) are flagged as bombs, then (8,2) '1' has (9,1) as a bomb, satisfying its requirement.\n\nSimilarly, (9,2) '1' has (9,1) as a bomb, satisfied.\n\n(8,1) '2' has (8,0) and (9,1) as bombs, satisfied.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nSo, perhaps I should flag (8,0) and (9,1).\n\nBut I only have one flag to place in this move.\n\nAlso, I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs remaining.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to overflag.\n\nWait, maybe I should flag (9,1) first and see if it makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll flag (9,1).\n\nThen, (9,2) '1' is satisfied.\n\n(8,1) '2' still needs one more bomb in its adjacent squares, which could be (8,0) or (7,0).\n\nBut (7,0) is '.', and (8,0) is '.'.\n\nI need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (9,1) to see if it's a bomb.\n\nBut that's risky because if it is a bomb, I'll lose the game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that seems safer.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 7: '_', which is already revealed.\n\nRow 2, column 8: '_', revealed.\n\nRow 2, column 9: '_', revealed.\n\nRow 3, column 4: '1', revealed.\n\nRow 3, column 5: '.', unexplored.\n\nRow 3, column 6: '.', unexplored.\n\nRow 3, column 7: '_', revealed.\n\nRow 3, column 8: '_', revealed.\n\nRow 3, column 9: '_', revealed.\n\nLooking at (3,5) '.': unexplored.\n\nLet's see what numbers are adjacent to it.\n\nAdjacent squares to (3,5):\n\n- (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nWhich are (2,4) '1', (2,5) '.', (2,6) '1', (3,4) '_', (3,6) '_', (4,4) '2', (4,5) '2', (4,6) '2'\n\nSo, (3,5) is adjacent to multiple '2's and '1's.\n\nThis seems dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, look at row 6, column 0: '.', unexplored.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (5,-1) [out of bounds], (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\nWhich are (5,0) '1', (5,1) '1', (6,1) '1', (7,0) '.', (7,1) '2', (7,2) '1'\n\nSo, possible bomb locations could be (7,0), (7,2), but not sure.\n\nThis seems risky as well.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that, when revealed, can give me more information.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 4: '1', already revealed.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nWhich are (0,3) '_', (0,4) '_', (0,5) '.', (1,3) '_', (1,5) '.', (2,3) '_', (2,4) '1', (2,5) '.'\n\nSo, (1,4) '1' needs exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nPossible bomb locations are (0,5), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nBut (2,5) is '.', and (1,5) is '.'\n\nIf I reveal (1,5), I might hit a bomb, but it could also be safe.\n\nThis is risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (0,5).\n\nLooking at (0,5): '.', adjacent to (0,4) '1', (0,6) '.', (1,4) '1', (1,5) '.', (1,6) '2'\n\nSo, revealing (0,5) could be dangerous, but maybe it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, look at (0,6): '.', adjacent to (0,5)., (0,7)., (1,5)., (1,6) '2', (1,7) '1'\n\nAgain, revealing (0,6) is risky.\n\nThis is tough.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability.\n\nI have 10 bombs left and 55 unexplored squares (10x10=100, minus the 45 revealed squares).\n\nSo, the probability of hitting a bomb is 10/55 \u2248 18.18%.\n\nBut I need to do better than random guessing.\n\nLooking back at row 9, column 1: '.', adjacent to (8,0)., (8,1) '2', (8,2) '1', (9,2) '1', (9,3) '_'\n\nIf I reveal (9,1), and if it's a bomb, I lose.\n\nBut if it's safe, it would reveal more information.\n\nAlternatively, if I flag (9,1), assuming it's a bomb, and proceed accordingly.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs remaining, it's crucial not to misplace any flags.\n\nI think I should flag (9,1) as a bomb.\n\nThen, (9,2) '1' is satisfied, and (8,1) '2' still needs one more bomb in its adjacent squares, which are (7,0), (8,0), or (9,0).\n\nBut (9,0) is '.', and (8,0) is '.'.\n\nSo, I need to place another flag in one of these.\n\nBut I need to verify if placing a flag in (8,0) makes sense.\n\nLooking at (8,1) '2', with adjacent squares:\n\n- (7,0)., (7,1) '2', (7,2) '1', (8,0)., (8,2) '1', (9,0)., (9,1) [flagged], (9,2) '1'\n\nSo, if (8,1) '2' has flags in (8,0) and (9,1), that satisfies it.\n\nSimilarly, (8,2) '1' has adjacent squares:\n\n- (7,1) '2', (7,2) '1', (7,3) '_', (8,1) '2', (8,3) '_', (9,1) [flagged], (9,2) '1', (9,3) '_'\n\nSo, with (9,1) flagged, (8,2) '1' is satisfied.\n\nAlso, (7,1) '2' has adjacent squares:\n\n- (6,0)., (6,1) '1', (6,2) '_', (7,0)., (7,2) '1', (8,0)., (8,1) '2', (8,2) '1'\n\nSo, (7,1) '2' needs two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nIf I flag (8,0), then (7,1) '2' has bombs in (8,0) and possibly (6,0), depending on other flags.\n\nBut I need to make sure that flagging (8,0) doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (6,0)., adjacent to (5,-1) [out of bounds], (5,0) '1', (5,1) '1', (6,1) '1', (7,0)., (7,1) '2', (7,2) '1'\n\nSo, (6,0) could be a bomb, but I don't have enough information.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just flag (9,1) and see.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I'm not misplacing flags.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that is less likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 3: '_', which is already revealed.\n\nRow 9, column 4: '_', revealed.\n\nRow 9, column 5: '1', revealed.\n\nRow 9, column 6: '.', unexplored.\n\nRow 9, column 7: '.', unexplored.\n\nRow 9, column 8: '1', revealed.\n\nRow 9, column 9: '_', revealed.\n\nLooking at (9,6): '.', adjacent to (8,5)., (8,6) '2', (8,7) '1', (9,5) '1', (9,7) '1', (10,5)., (10,6)., (10,7). [out of bounds]\n\nSo, adjacent squares are (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7)\n\nWhich are (8,5) '1', (8,6) '2', (8,7) '1', (9,5) '1', (9,7) '1'\n\nSo, revealing (9,6) might be safe, as it's surrounded by numbers.\n\nBut I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (9,6).\n\nI think that's a reasonable move.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed in this Minesweeper game, we need to make an informed decision about our next move, considering the current state of the board and the rules of the game. Given the complexity of the board, it's essential to carefully analyze the numbers and the positions of the revealed and unexplored squares.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze Revealed Numbers:** Look at the numbers on the board to determine possible locations of bombs based on their adjacent squares.\n2. **Check for Obvious Moves:** Identify squares that are safe to reveal or definitely contain bombs.\n3. **Consider Probabilities:** If no obvious moves are present, consider the probability of a square containing a bomb and choose the one with the lowest probability.\n4. **Avoid Guesswork:** Try to make moves based on logical deductions rather than random choices.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a Minesweeper game, the \"solution code\" in this context would be the coordinates of the next move and whether to place a flag or reveal the square.\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: After analyzing the board, it seems that revealing square (9,6) is a relatively safe choice as it is surrounded by numbered squares, providing a good opportunity to gather more information without high risk.\n\nMOVE: 9,6,false\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Row and Column Selection:** Square (9,6) was chosen because it is adjacent to several revealed numbers, which can help in deducing the positions of bombs more accurately.\n- **Action:** Choosing to reveal the square (flag=false) as opposed to placing a flag (flag=true), since there is no strong indication that this square contains a bomb.\n- **Safety Consideration:** Given the surrounding numbers and the current state of the board, revealing this square is less likely to result in hitting a bomb compared to other unexplored squares.\n\nThis approach balances the need to progress in the game with the risk of hitting a bomb, aiming to gain more information about the board's layout safely.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 1 2 1\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ 2 2 2 _ _ _\n5 1 1 _ _ 1 . 2 1 _ _\n6 . 1 _ _ 1 2 . 1 _ _\n7 . 2 1 _ _ 1 . 2 1 _\n8 . . 1 _ _ 1 . . 1 _\n9 . . 1 _ _ 1 . . 1 _", "sucess": false}
