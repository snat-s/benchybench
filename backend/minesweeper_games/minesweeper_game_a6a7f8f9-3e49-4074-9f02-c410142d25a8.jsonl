A common strategy is to start in the center of the board, as this maximizes the chances of revealing a number that provides useful information about the surrounding tiles.

The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). None are flagged, so there must be exactly one bomb among these squares. Since (4,0) and (4,1) are revealed and safe, the bomb must be among (2,0), (2,1), or (3,1). However, (3,1) is already revealed as '2', so it cannot be a bomb. Therefore, the bomb must be either (2,0) or (2,1). Since we cannot determine which one it is, we should reveal one of them to gather more information.\n\n### EXPLANATION:\nThe number '1' at (3,0) indicates that there is exactly one bomb among its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), and (4,1). Since (4,0) and (4,1) are already revealed and safe, and (3,1) is revealed as '2', the bomb must be either (2,0) or (2,1). To gather more information, I will reveal (2,0).\n\n### MOVE: 2,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n4 _ 2 . 3 2 3 2 1 1 .\n5 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 1\n6 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n7 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n8 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n9 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _", "sucess": false}
