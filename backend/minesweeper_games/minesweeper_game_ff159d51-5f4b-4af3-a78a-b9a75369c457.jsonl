Since there's already a flag at (2,0), there should be no other bombs adjacent to (1,1). Therefore, (2,1) and (3,1) are safe to reveal.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Safe Moves\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n\n- **Cell (2,1):** Adjacent to (1,1) which has a flag at (2,0). Since (1,1) shows `1` and already has one adjacent flag, (2,1) is safe to reveal.\n  \n- **Cell (3,1):** Similarly, adjacent to (1,1) which already has a flag at (2,0). Therefore, (3,1) is also safe to reveal.\n\n### Step 4: Deciding the Next Move\n\nGiven that revealing (2,1) and (3,1) are safe moves, I'll choose one for the next action.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nReveal cell (2,1).\n\n### Final Move\n\n**EXPLANATION:**  \nCell (2,1) is adjacent to cell (1,1) which shows `1` and already has a flag at (2,0).
