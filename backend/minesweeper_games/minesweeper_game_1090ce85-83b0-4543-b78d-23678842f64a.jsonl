{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nThe board is a 10x10 grid, and all the squares are unexplored, marked with dots. There are 10 bombs placed somewhere on the board, and I have 10 flags remaining. Since no squares have been revealed yet, I don't have any numbers or flags to go on. \n\nGiven that all squares are unexplored, my options are either to start by revealing a square or placing a flag. However, since I don't have any information about where the bombs might be, placing a flag without any clues could be risky. If I place a flag and it's incorrect, it might block me from correctly flagging an actual bomb later on.\n\nOn the other hand, revealing a square could give me some information. If I reveal a square and it's a number, that number will tell me how many bombs are adjacent to it. If I reveal a bomb, the game ends, which I obviously want to avoid. But since I don't know where the bombs are, revealing a square could be a good starting point to get some data.\n\nI think the best approach is to start by revealing a square. Since all squares are equally likely to be bombs at this point, I might as well pick a spot that could give me maximum information. Maybe the center of the board? Or perhaps a corner? I'm not sure if it matters at this stage.\n\nWait, in Minesweeper, the edges and corners have fewer adjacent squares, so if I reveal a corner, the number (if it's not a bomb) would only have two adjacent squares. Maybe starting in the middle would give more information because it has eight adjacent squares, so the number would be more informative.\n\nBut again, since all squares are unexplored, any square I reveal has an equal chance of being a bomb or not. Maybe I should just pick a random square to start with. Let's say I choose position (5,5), the center. If it's a number, that could help me start deducing the surrounding areas. If it's a bomb, the game ends, but that's a risk I have to take.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting near the top-left corner, like (0,0), since that's a common starting point. But as I thought earlier, the corner only has two adjacent squares, so the number would be limited. Maybe it's better to start in the middle for more data.\n\nWait, but if I reveal a square and it's a 0, that means no adjacent bombs, which would clear all surrounding squares, giving me a lot of information. That could be really helpful. So maybe I should aim for a square that, if it's a 0, would reveal a large area.\n\nBut since I don't know where the bombs are, I can't know if a square is a 0 or not. So perhaps the best approach is to just start by revealing a square, any square, to get the game going.\n\nAnother thought: since I have 10 flags and 10 bombs, I need to be careful not to place flags incorrectly. But since I have no information yet, placing a flag now would be a pure guess, which isn't strategic. So revealing is better.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing a square. Let's pick (5,5) as my first move. If it's a bomb, I lose, but if it's a number or a 0, I can start using that information to guide my next moves.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Since the board is entirely unexplored, revealing a central square provides the most potential information. If it's a number, it will indicate adjacent bombs, aiding future moves. If it's a 0, it will clear surrounding squares, which is highly informative. Placing a flag without information is risky, so revealing is the better choice.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
