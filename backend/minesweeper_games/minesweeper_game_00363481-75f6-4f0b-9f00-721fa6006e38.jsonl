However, looking back, (1,0) and (1,2) are both flagged, which exceeds the bomb count of 1 for this square.\n\n**Square (1,1): Value = 1**\nAdjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\nFlagged adjacent squares: (1,0), (1,2), (2,2)\nAgain, the value is 1, but there are three flagged adjacent squares, which is inconsistent.\n\n**Square (2,1): Value = 2**\nAdjacent squares: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\nFlagged adjacent squares: (1,0), (1,2), (2,2)\nThe value is 2, but there are three flagged adjacent squares, indicating a conflict.\n\n**Square (3,1): Value = 1**\nAdjacent squares: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\nFlagged adjacent squares: (2,2)\nThe value is 1, and there's one flagged adjacent square, which is consistent.\n\n**Square (4,1): Value = 1**\nAdjacent squares: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)\nFlagged adjacent squares: None\nThe value is 1, and there are no flagged adjacent squares, so there must be one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Square (4,2): Value = 1**\nAdjacent squares: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\nFlagged adjacent squares: None\nThe value is 1, and there are no flagged adjacent squares, so there must be one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Square (4,3): Value = 1**\nAdjacent squares: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)\nFlagged adjacent squares: None\nThe value is 1, and there are no flagged adjacent squares, so there must be one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Square (5,3): Value = 1**\nAdjacent squares: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\nFlagged adjacent squares: None\nThe value is 1, and there are no flagged adjacent squares, so there must be one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Square (6,0): Value = 1**\nAdjacent squares: (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1)\nFlagged adjacent squares: None\nThe value is 1, and there are no flagged adjacent squares, so there must be one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Square (6,1): Value = 1**\nAdjacent squares: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\nFlagged adjacent squares: None\nThe value is 1, and there are no flagged adjacent squares, so there must be one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Square (6,3): Value = 2**\nAdjacent squares: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\nFlagged adjacent squares: None\nThe value is 2, and there are no flagged adjacent squares, so there must be two bombs adjacent.\n\n**Square (7,1): Value = 2**\nAdjacent squares: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\nFlagged adjacent squares: None\nThe value is 2, and there are no flagged adjacent squares, so there must be two bombs adjacent.\n\n**Square (7,2): Value = 1**\nAdjacent squares: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)\nFlagged adjacent squares: None\nThe value is 1, and there are no flagged adjacent squares, so there must be one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Square (7,3): Value = 3**\nAdjacent squares: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)\nFlagged adjacent squares: None\nThe value is 3, and there are no flagged adjacent squares, so there must be three bombs adjacent.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying Conflicts and Potential Corrections\n\nFrom the analysis above, several numbered squares have discrepancies between their values and the number of adjacent flagged squares:\n\n1. **Square (0,1):** Value = 1, but has two flagged adjacent squares.\n2. **Square (1,1):** Value = 1, but has three flagged adjacent squares.\n3. **Square (2,1):** Value = 2, but has three flagged adjacent squares.\n\nThese inconsistencies suggest that some of the flags may be incorrectly placed. Specifically:\n\n- **Flag at (1,0):** Adjacent to (0,1) and (1,1). Both squares show a value of 1, but having both flagged would mean two bombs adjacent, which contradicts their values.\n  \n- **Flag at (1,2):** Adjacent to (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1). Again, this flag contributes to the overcounting of bombs for these squares.\n\n- **Flag at (2,2):** Adjacent to (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,1). This flag adds to the overcounting for squares (1,1) and (2,1).\n\n### Step 5: Deciding on Corrective Actions\n\nGiven these conflicts, the most appropriate action is to **remove one of the incorrectly placed flags**. Removing a flag will help resolve the overcounting issue and allow us to reassess the board accurately.\n\nLet's consider removing the flag at **(1,0)**:\n\n- **Impact on (0,1):** Previously had two adjacent flags; removing one leaves one, which matches its value of 1.\n  \n- **Impact on (1,1):** Previously had three adjacent flags; removing one leaves two, which is still inconsistent with its value of 1.\n\nThis partial resolution suggests that removing just one flag may not be sufficient. Instead, **removing both flags at (1,0) and (1,2)** would more effectively resolve the conflicts:\n\n- **Impact on (0,1):** Removes both adjacent flags, leaving zero, which contradicts its value of 1.\n  \n- **Impact on (1,1):** Removes two adjacent flags, leaving one, which matches its value of 1.\n  \n- **Impact on (2,1):** Removes one adjacent flag, leaving two, which matches its value of 2.\n\nThis approach seems more balanced. By removing both flags at (1,0) and (1,2), we ensure that:\n\n- **Square (0,1):** Has zero adjacent flags, meaning the bomb must be in one of its unexplored adjacent squares (0,0), (0,2), or (1,1).\n  \n- **Square (1,1):** Has one adjacent flag at (2,2), which aligns with its value of 1.\n  \n- **Square (2,1):** Has two adjacent flags at (2,2) and potentially another bomb in its unexplored adjacent squares.\n\nHowever, removing both flags at (1,0) and (1,2) may leave us with insufficient information to proceed confidently. Instead, a more conservative approach would be to **remove the flag at (1,2)** first and reassess:\n\n- **Impact on (0,1):** Removes one adjacent flag, leaving one, which matches its value of 1.\n  \n- **Impact on (1,1):** Removes one adjacent flag, leaving two, which is still inconsistent with its value of 1.\n  \n- **Impact on (2,1):** Removes one adjacent flag, leaving two, which matches its value of 2.\n\nThis still leaves an inconsistency at (1,1). Therefore, the most effective initial action is to **remove the flag at (1,0)**:\n\n- **Impact on (0,1):** Removes one adjacent flag, leaving one, which matches its value of 1.\n  \n- **Impact on (1,1):** Removes one adjacent flag, leaving two, which is inconsistent with its value of 1.\n  \n- **Impact on (2,1):** Removes zero adjacent flags, leaving three, which is inconsistent with its value of 2.\n\nThis partial adjustment still leaves inconsistencies, suggesting that multiple flags may need to be removed. However, to proceed cautiously, I'll start by removing the flag at **(1,0)** and then reassess the board.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Removing the flag at (1,0) helps resolve the overcounting of bombs adjacent to square (0,1), bringing its flagged bombs from two down to one, which matches its value. This correction will allow for a more accurate assessment of the board and guide our next moves.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,0,true\n\n*Note: The `flag` parameter is set to `true` to indicate the removal of an existing flag at the specified coordinates.*", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 F 1 F . . . . . . .\n2 _ 2 F . . . . . . .\n3 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 _ 1 1 1 . . . . . .\n5 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n6 1 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n7 . 2 1 3 . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

(8,4).\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Conflicts\n\nFrom the analysis of tile (1,1), which shows '1' but has two adjacent flags, we've identified a conflict. This means one of the flags at (1,0) or (2,2) is incorrectly placed.\n\n### Step 3: Resolving the Conflict\n\nTo resolve this, let's determine which flag might be incorrect.\n\n#### Analyzing Flag at (1,0):\nAdjacent tiles:\n- (0,0): `_`\n- (0,1): `1`\n- (1,1): `1`\n- (2,0): `_`\n\n**Observations:**\n- Tile (0,1) shows '1' and has a flag at (1,0), which is consistent.\n- Tile (1,1) shows '1' and has a flag at (1,0), which should mean no other adjacent bombs.\n- However, tile (1,1) also has a flag at (2,2), creating a conflict.\n\n#### Analyzing Flag at (2,2):\nAdjacent tiles:\n- (1,1): `1`\n- (1,2): `.`\n- (2,1): `2`\n- (2,3): `.`\n- (3,1): `1`\n- (3,2): `.`\n\n**Observations:**\n- Tile (2,1) shows '2' and has flags at (1,0) and (2,2), which totals two flags, matching the number.\n- Tile (1,1) shows '1' and has flags at (1,0) and (2,2), which is inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe flag at (1,0) seems necessary for tile (0,1) and (1,1). However, the flag at (2,2) causes a conflict with tile (1,1). Therefore, the flag at (2,2) is likely incorrect and should be removed.\n\n### Step 4: Making the Move\n\nBased on the above analysis, we should remove the flag at (2,2).\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe flag at (2,2) creates a conflict with tile (1,1), which shows '1' but has two adjacent flags. Removing this flag resolves the inconsistency and aligns with the rules of Minesweeper.\n\n**Move:**\n```\nMOVE: 2,2,false\n```\n\nThis means we are revealing the tile at (2,2) instead of leaving it flagged. If the tile is safe, it will reveal its true state, and if it's a bomb, the game will end. However, given the conflict identified, it's highly probable that the tile is safe.", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 F 1 . . . . . . . .\n2 _ 2 F . . . . . . .\n3 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 _ 1 1 1 . . . . . .\n5 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n6 1 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n7 . 2 1 3 . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Therefore, two more bombs must be in the adjacent cells.\n\n### **Identifying Safe Moves**\n\nBased on the above analysis, let's identify cells that are safe to reveal or need to be flagged.\n\n#### **Safe Cells to Reveal:**\n\n1. **Cell (0,0):**\n   - Adjacent to (0,1), which has a number `1` with one flag adjacent.\n   - Since (0,1) already has one bomb adjacent (flagged at (1,0)), (0,0) is safe.\n\n2. **Cell (0,2):**\n   - Adjacent to (0,1) with one flag adjacent.\n   - Safe to reveal.\n\n3. **Cell (1,2):**\n   - Adjacent to (1,1) with one flag adjacent.\n   - Safe to reveal.\n\n4. **Cell (2,0):**\n   - Adjacent to (2,1) with two flags adjacent.\n   - Safe to reveal.\n\n5. **Cell (3,0):**\n   - Adjacent to (3,1) with one flag adjacent.\n   - Safe to reveal.\n\n6. **Cell (3,2):**\n   - Adjacent to (3,1) with one flag adjacent.\n   - Safe to reveal.\n\n7. **Cell (4,0):**\n   - Adjacent to (4,1) with one flag adjacent.\n   - Safe to reveal.\n\n8. **Cell (5,0):**\n   - Adjacent to (6,0) with a number `1` and no flags.\n   - Since (6,0) needs one bomb adjacent, but (5,0) is unexplored, it could be a bomb. However, considering other clues, let's assess further.\n\nWait, let's double-check **Cell (5,0)**:\n\n- **Cell (6,0):** Number `1` and no adjacent flags.\n  - Adjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1)\n  - Therefore, one of these cells must contain a bomb.\n\nLooking at **Cell (5,0)**:\n- Adjacent to (6,0) which needs one bomb.\n- If (5,0) is a bomb, then the adjacent cells (6,1), (7,0), (7,1) are safe.\n- Alternatively, if (5,0) is safe, the bomb must be among (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1).\n\nHowever, without more information, it's safer to avoid revealing (5,0) for now.\n\nLet's reconsider and look for safer options.\n\n#### **Flagging Potential Bombs:**\n\n1. **Cell (3,3):** Number `2` with one flag adjacent.\n   - Needs one more bomb in adjacent cells.\n   - Adjacent unexplored cells: (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n   - **Cell (3,2):** Already analyzed; safe to reveal.\n   - **Cell (4,2):** Safe to reveal.\n   - **Cell (4,3):** Safe to reveal.\n   - **Cell (4,4):** Unexplored.\n   - **Cell (3,4):** Unexplored.\n   - **Cell (2,3):** Unexplored.\n   - **Cell (2,4):** Unexplored.\n   - Among these, (4,4) and (3,4) are unexplored. Let's see if we can deduce which one could be the bomb.\n\nLooking at **Cell (3,3)**: Number `2` with one flag at (2,2).\n- Needs one more bomb in adjacent cells.\n- **Cell (4,4):** Adjacent to (3,3) and unexplored.\n- **Cell (3,4):** Adjacent to (3,3) and unexplored.\n- Let's consider if one of these is the bomb.\n\nHowever, without more information, it's safer to look elsewhere for now.\n\n2. **Cell (6,3):** Number `2` with one flag adjacent.\n   - Needs one more bomb in adjacent cells.\n   - Adjacent unexplored cells: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n   - **Cell (5,3):** Number `1` with one flag adjacent; safe.\n   - **Cell (6,2):** Unexplored.\n   - **Cell (6,4):** Unexplored.\n   - **Cell (7,2):** Number `1` with no adjacent flags; could be a bomb.\n   - **Cell (7,3):** Number `3` with one flag adjacent; needs two more bombs.\n   - **Cell (7,4):** Unexplored.\n   - Let's focus on **Cell (6,2)** and **Cell (6,4)**.\n\nLooking at **Cell (6,2)**:\n- Adjacent to (6,1) with number `1` and no flags.\n- **Cell (6,1):** Number `1` with no adjacent flags; needs one bomb adjacent.\n  - Adjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n  - **Cell (5,0):** Unexplored.\n  - **Cell (5,1):** Unexplored.\n  - **Cell (5,2):** Unexplored.\n  - **Cell (6,0):** Number `1`.\n  - **Cell (6,2):** Unexplored.\n  - **Cell (7,0):** Unexplored.\n  - **Cell (7,1):** Unexplored.\n  - **Cell (7,2):** Number `1`.\n  - Since (6,1) needs one bomb adjacent, and (6,2) is unexplored, it could be the bomb.\n\nTherefore, **Cell (6,2)** is likely a bomb and should be flagged.\n\n### **Determining the Next Move**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **Cell (6,2)** is identified as a potential bomb because:\n  - It is adjacent to **Cell (6,1)**, which has a number `1` and no adjacent flags.\n  - **Cell (6,1)** requires exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells, and **Cell (6,2)** is the only unexplored cell in its vicinity that could logically be the bomb.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be to place a flag on **Cell (6,2)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n**EXPLANATION:**  \nBy analyzing the numbers and existing flags, **Cell (6,2)** is identified as a bomb adjacent to **Cell (6,1)**, which requires exactly one adjacent bomb. Since **Cell (6,2)** is the only unexplored cell adjacent to **Cell (6,1)**, it must be the bomb.\n\n**MOVE:** 6,2,true (Place a flag at row 6, column 2)", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 F 1 . . . . . . . .\n2 _ 2 F . . . . . . .\n3 _ 1 . 2 . . . . . .\n4 _ 1 1 1 . . . . . .\n5 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n6 1 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n7 . 2 1 3 . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

It needs one more bomb adjacent.\n\nLooking at adjacent cells to (1,4):\n\n- (0,4): '1' with no adjacent bombs, so safe.\n  \n- (2,4): unexplored.\n\nTherefore, the second bomb adjacent to (1,4) must be at **(2,4)**.\n\nPlacing a bomb at (2,4):\n\n- **Cell (1,4): '2'** now has two bombs adjacent: (1,3) and (2,4).\n  \nNow, let's update our list of potential bomb locations by removing these confirmed bombs.\n\nRemaining potential bomb locations:\n\n- **(3,2)**, **(3,4)**, **(4,4)**, **(5,2)**, **(5,4)**, **(6,4)**\n  \n- **(7,0)**, **(7,4)**, **(8,0)**, **(8,1)**, **(8,2)**, **(8,4)**\n\nTotal bombs placed so far: **7** (including the 5 flags)\n\nRemaining bombs to place: **3**\n\n### **Further Narrowing Down Bomb Locations**\n\nLet's analyze cells that require specific numbers of bombs.\n\n#### **Cell (3,3): '2'**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (2,2): `F` (flagged)\n  \n- (2,3): `.`\n  \n- (2,4): `B` (bomb)\n  \n- (3,2): `.`\n  \n- (3,4): `.`\n  \n- (4,2): '1' (safe)\n  \n- (4,3): '1' (safe)\n  \n- (4,4): `.`\n\nCell (3,3) shows '2' with one flag at (2,2) and one bomb at (2,4). Therefore, no additional bombs are adjacent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Cells (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,4) are safe.\n\nThis eliminates **(3,2)**, **(3,4)**, and **(4,4)** from the potential bomb list.\n\nRemaining potential bomb locations:\n\n- **(5,2)**, **(5,4)**, **(6,4)**\n  \n- **(7,0)**, **(7,4)**, **(8,0)**, **(8,1)**, **(8,2)**, **(8,4)**\n\n#### **Cell (4,3): '1'**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (3,2): safe\n  \n- (3,3): '2' (safe)\n  \n- (3,4): safe\n  \n- (4,2): '1' (safe)\n  \n- (4,4): safe\n  \n- (5,2): `.`\n  \n- (5,3): '1' (safe)\n  \n- (5,4): `.`\n\nCell (4,3) shows '1' with no adjacent flags or bombs. Therefore, there must be **one bomb** adjacent to it.\n\n**Potential bomb locations:** (5,2), (5,4)\n\nSimilarly, **Cell (5,3): '1'** has adjacent cells:\n\n- (4,2): '1' (safe)\n  \n- (4,3): '1' (safe)\n  \n- (4,4): safe\n  \n- (5,2): `.`\n  \n- (5,4): `.`\n  \n- (6,2): '1' (safe)\n  \n- (6,3): '2' (safe)\n  \n- (6,4): `.`\n\nCell (5,3) shows '1' with no adjacent flags or bombs. Therefore, there must be **one bomb** adjacent to it.\n\n**Potential bomb locations:** (5,2), (5,4)\n\nGiven that both Cells (4,3) and (5,3) point to **(5,2)** and **(5,4)** as potential bomb locations, and we have only **3 bombs** left to place, let's consider the implications.\n\nIf we place a bomb at **(5,2)**:\n\n- **Cell (4,3): '1'** would have its bomb at (5,2), satisfying its requirement.\n  \n- **Cell (5,3): '1'** would then need its bomb at (5,4).\n\nPlacing bombs at **(5,2)** and **(5,4)** would account for **2 bombs**, leaving **1 bomb** remaining.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining potential bomb locations:\n\n- **(6,4)**\n  \n- **(7,0)**, **(7,4)**, **(8,0)**, **(8,1)**, **(8,2)**, **(8,4)**\n\nLet's analyze **Cell (6,3): '2'**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (5,2): `B` (bomb)\n  \n- (5,3): '1' (safe)\n  \n- (5,4): `B` (bomb)\n  \n- (6,2): 'F' (flagged)\n  \n- (6,4): `.`\n  \n- (7,2): '1' (safe)\n  \n- (7,3): '3' (safe)\n  \n- (7,4): `.`\n\nCell (6,3) shows '2' with one flag at (6,2) and one bomb at (5,2). It needs **one more bomb** adjacent.\n\n**Potential bomb locations:** (6,4), (7,4)\n\nPlacing a bomb at **(6,4)**:\n\n- This satisfies Cell (6,3): '2' with bombs at (5,2) and (6,4).\n  \nNow, we've placed **3 bombs**: at **(5,2)**, **(5,4)**, and **(6,4)**.\n\nThis accounts for all **10 bombs** (5 flags + 5 bombs placed).\n\n### **Finalizing Bomb Locations**\n\nBased on the above deductions, the final bomb locations are:\n\n1. Flagged Bombs:\n   - (0,2)\n   - (1,0)\n   - (2,2)\n   - (3,1)\n   - (6,2)\n\n2. Deduced Bombs:\n   - (1,3)\n   - (2,4)\n   - (5,2)\n   - (5,4)\n   - (6,4)\n\n### **Identifying Safe Moves**\n\nWith all bombs accounted for, all remaining unexplored cells are safe to reveal. Let's identify some safe moves.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- **Cell (5,0): `.`** \u2013 Safe\n\n  Adjacent cells:\n  \n  - (4,0): `_` (safe)\n  \n  - (4,1): '1' (safe)\n  \n  - (5,1): `.` (safe)\n  \n  - (6,0): '1' (safe)\n  \n  - (6,1): '1' (safe)\n\nSince all adjacent cells are safe or already revealed, (5,0) is safe to reveal.\n\n### **Conclusion and Next Move**\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, the next safest move is to reveal cell (5,0).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** After analyzing all numbered cells and accounting for all bombs, cell (5,0) is determined to be safe to reveal as all adjacent cells have been accounted for without any bomb threats.\n\n**MOVE:** 5,0,false", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 F 2 1 . . . . .\n1 F 1 . . 2 . . . . .\n2 _ 2 F . . . . . . .\n3 _ F . 2 . . . . . .\n4 _ 1 1 1 . . . . . .\n5 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n6 1 1 F 2 . . . . . .\n7 . 2 1 3 . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
