Starting at the top-left, we have several unrevealed tiles near numbers. Focusing on (3,1), this number indicates there is 1 bomb adjacent to it. The possible adjacent tiles that could contain a bomb from (3,1) are (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), and (4,0). Since (2,0) is revealed and does not indicate a bomb, and (2,1) is revealed, the bomb must be at (3,0), which is currently unrevealed. This aligns with our current understanding of the situation. Similarly, for (3,2), there is only one unrevealed tile adjacent, which is (3,3), implying it must have a bomb for the board to be correct.\n\nThus, it is safe to conclude that (3,0) does contain a bomb, but to solidify more certainty, we can follow another strategy for (5,9) which is adjacent to (4,8) with a 1 and would not be correct if a bomb is there since bombs are not marked adjacent to (4,8).

We'll look for tiles where the number of adjacent flags matches the number displayed on the tile. Specifically, look at the revealed numbers in relation to their surrounding unexplored tiles.\n\n- Look at the tile (2,2), which is marked with a '3'. It currently has no flags around it, but three unexplored tiles: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). Since all three of these could potentially have bombs to fulfill the '3' condition, it is not safe to reveal here.\n\n- Next, evaluate (3,3) marked with a '4'. This number has tiles: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) around it still unexplored. However, we still have no flags near it, so decisions here should be cautious.\n\n- Moving to (4,3) which has '1' and an adjacent unexplored (3,3), yet it doesn't help us.\n\nHowever, observe (6,1) which is marked with '1'. It has two unexplored tiles: (5,0) and (5,1). Yet it couldn't help us much as there seem two potential placements for a bomb.\n\nDespite previous views, check (1,7). The number shows '1', and currently has unexplored tiles (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,7). Yet, its neighbor (0,8) shows '1' and flagged (1,7) so it should be regarded as well before making any risky move.\n\nWithout further perspective or bombs adjacent indications, it's safer to reveal additionally unexplored spaces.
