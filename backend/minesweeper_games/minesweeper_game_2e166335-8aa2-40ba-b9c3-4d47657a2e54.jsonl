In Minesweeper, the first move is typically chosen strategically to minimize the risk of hitting a bomb.\n\nA good initial strategy is to select a center or near-center square with a low probability of being a bomb. The center of the board tends to have more open space and is less likely to immediately trigger a bomb.\n\nEXPLANATION: Starting with a central square to maximize the chance of revealing multiple empty spaces\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Around the (4,6) tile showing '2', we only have one clear safe move\n2. In the bottom right section with multiple '_' tiles, we need careful deduction\n3. The cluster of numbers in rows 3-5 provide important information\n\nFocusing on the '2' at (5,3), we see:\n- 1 flag already adjacent\n- This means one more flag must be placed nearby\n- Potential bomb locations near (5,4) and (4,5)\n\nMOVE strategy:\nI'll reveal a tile that seems relatively safe based on surrounding numbers.\n\nThe tile at (6,5) looks promising:\n- Surrounded by mostly low-numbered or revealed tiles\n- No immediate indication of a high bomb likelihood\n\nMOVE: 6,5,false\n\nThis reveals more of the board and provides more information for subsequent moves.
