Given the current state of the board, it's essential to analyze the revealed numbers and their adjacent flags. Starting with the top-left corner and moving downwards, we notice that there are several revealed numbers with adjacent empty spaces. One such space is at position (4,5) with a revealed number '2' and an adjacent empty space. However, without direct adjacent flags or numbers that could help us deduce the contents of the empty spaces, we should look for other clues. \n\nConsidering the row at position x=6, we see a '1' at (6,0) and a '2' at (6,2). Given the limited information and the need to avoid conflicts with existing numbers, a reasonable approach is to reveal a tile that could provide more information without immediately risking a game-over. \n\nA potential move could be to reveal a tile adjacent to a revealed number, hoping to uncover more numbers or empty spaces that could help in further analysis. However, given the constraints and the aim to provide a clear, step-by-step analysis, let's focus on a tile that, when revealed, could give us significant insight into the board's state.\n\nMOVE: 6,2,false \n\nThis move aims to reveal the tile at position (6,2), which is adjacent to a '2' and could potentially reveal more about the distribution of bombs in that area, helping in future flag placements or revelations.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . 2 1 1 1\n2 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n3 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n4 . . . . 2 . 1 _ 1 1\n5 . . . . 2 1 1 _ 1 .\n6 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n8 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _\n9 _ 1 . 1 _ 1 . 1 _ _", "sucess": true}
