Its unexplored adjacent tiles are (0,3) and (1,4). Since there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to it, we know one of these two tiles is a bomb. However, we need more information to determine which one.\n\n2. The number **1** at (1,0) has no adjacent flags. Its unexplored adjacent tiles are (0,0) and (2,0). Again, one of these two must be a bomb, but we need more information.\n\n3. The number **2** at (1,1) has no adjacent flags. Its unexplored adjacent tiles are (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), and (2,1). There must be exactly two bombs in these tiles. This is useful information, but we need to correlate it with other numbers.\n\n4. The number **1** at (1,4) has no adjacent flags. Its unexplored adjacent tiles are (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), and (2,5). However, since (0,4) is already revealed as a number, we can ignore it. This gives us more information, but it's still not conclusive.\n\n5. The number **1** at (2,0) has no adjacent flags. Its unexplored adjacent tiles are (1,0), (1,1), and (3,0). One of these must be a bomb.\n\n6. The number **2** at (3,1) has no adjacent flags. Its unexplored adjacent tiles are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), and (4,2). There must be exactly two bombs in these tiles.\n\n### Key Insight:\nThe number **1** at (0,4) and the number **1** at (1,4) share adjacent unexplored tiles. Specifically, (0,3) and (1,5) are adjacent to both numbers. If we assume (0,3) is a bomb, then (1,5) cannot be a bomb, and vice versa. However, we need to verify this assumption with other numbers.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest move is to reveal the tile at (1,5), as it is adjacent to the number **1** at (1,4) and does not conflict with any existing flags or numbers. This will give us more information to proceed.\n\nMOVE: 1,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n1 1 2 2 1 1 . . . . .\n2 1 . . . . . . . . .\n3 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
