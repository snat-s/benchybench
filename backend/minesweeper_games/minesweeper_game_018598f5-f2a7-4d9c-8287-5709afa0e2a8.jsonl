To make the next move, we should analyze the revealed numbers and their adjacent flags. Looking at row 1, column 0-9, we see a series of '1's, indicating that there is one bomb adjacent to each of these numbers. Since there are no flags in this row, it's likely that the bomb is in one of the unexplored spaces.

Given the rules and the state of the board, a strategic move would be to reveal a tile that could provide more information about the surrounding area, especially around tiles with numbers that could help in deducing the location of bombs. Revealing a tile adjacent to a number can help in understanding how many bombs are left to be found in that area. Considering the board's current state, revealing a tile near a '1' could be particularly insightful, as it would indicate the presence or absence of a bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nMOVE: 2,1,false \n\nThis move aims to reveal the tile at position (2,1), which is adjacent to several revealed numbers, including a '1' and a '2'.
