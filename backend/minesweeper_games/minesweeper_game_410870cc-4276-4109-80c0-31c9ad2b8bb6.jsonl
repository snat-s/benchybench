{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 3, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Let's analyze the current board state in detail:\n\n1. We have identified all the revealed numbered tiles and their adjacent flagged spaces.\n2. The flagged spaces are located at (4,3), (4,4), and there are some interactions with the visible revealed numbers.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n- At (1,2), the number is 1, and it has 3 adjacent unexplored squares, but no flags, meaning we can potentially reveal those squares.\n- At (1,3), the number is 1, but it has 2 adjacent flags at (4,3) and (4,4), which doesn't conflict because both these tiles are further down the board.\n- At (2,3), which is blank, indicates it is a safe square and should be revealed.\n- At (3,2), the number is 2. There is currently 1 flagged square adjacent to this (at (4,3), which we know is flagged), meaning we need to put an additional flag next to (3,2) in any of the adjacent unexplored squares.\n- There are currently 10 bombs and 8 flags remaining; this means we need to find the best placements for flags considering revealed numbers as well.\n\n**Assessment of Flag Placement:**\n\nUpon reevaluating, we notice that:\n- At (3,4), since it's adjacent to a '2' at (3,2) and a '1' at (1,3), needs a flag as we've already flagged one adjacent space at (4,3). However, there are no flags yet on (3,3) which connects to (3,2).\n\nThe safest move now, without conflicting with existing numbers is to reveal more spaces that are known to be safe. Thus, I will reveal the space at (2,3) because it remains unclaimed and adds clarity to bomb placements.\n\n**Move Decision:**\n1. I will reveal the safe space at (2,3).\n\nEXPLANATION: I am choosing to reveal the unclaimed space at (2,3) as it is currently unexplored and will likely not conflict with visible bomb numbers while providing more information about the neighboring numbers.\n\nMOVE: 2,3,false", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 1 _\n2 _ _ 1 . 1 _ 1 . 1 _\n3 1 1 2 1 1 _ 1 1 2 1\n4 . . .
