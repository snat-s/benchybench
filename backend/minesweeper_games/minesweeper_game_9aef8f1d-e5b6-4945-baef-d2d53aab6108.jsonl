Examining (0,6) with Number '1':**\n  \n  - Adjacent squares: (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7).\n  \n  - Currently, there's a flag at (0,7), which signifies a bomb.\n  \n  - Since (0,6) shows '1', and there's already one flag adjacent to it, no other adjacent squares can contain bombs.\n  \n  - **Implication:** Squares (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), and (1,7) are safe to reveal.\n\n**2. Examining (1,7) with Number '2':**\n  \n  - Adjacent squares: (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8).\n  \n  - There's a flag at (0,7).\n  \n  - Since (1,7) shows '2', and there's already one flag adjacent to it, there must be exactly one more bomb among the remaining adjacent squares.\n  \n  - **Implication:** Among (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), and (2,8), exactly one contains a bomb.\n\n**3. Examining (2,7) with Number '2':**\n  \n  - Adjacent squares: (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8).\n  \n  - There's no flag adjacent to it yet.\n  \n  - (2,7) shows '2', meaning exactly two of its adjacent squares contain bombs.\n  \n  - **Implication:** Among these eight adjacent squares, two contain bombs.\n\n### **Identifying Safe Moves**\n\nBased on the above analysis, certain squares can be confidently revealed as they do not contain bombs:\n\n- **Square (0,5):** Adjacent to (0,6), which has only one bomb flagged at (0,7).\n  \n- **Square (1,5):** Adjacent to (0,6), which has only one bomb flagged at (0,7).\n  \n- **Square (1,6):** Adjacent to (0,6), which has only one bomb flagged at (0,7).\n  \n- **Square (1,7):** While it shows '2', and one bomb is already flagged at (0,7), revealing it isn't recommended until further information is available.\n\n### **Deciding the Next Move**\n\nConsidering safety and the information at hand, the best move is to reveal a square that is guaranteed to be safe. Among the identified safe squares, (1,5) is a strategic choice because:\n\n- It's adjacent to (0,6), which has already accounted for its bomb with the flag at (0,7).\n  \n- Revealing (1,5) provides additional information about its adjacent squares, potentially unlocking further safe moves.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Square (1,5) is adjacent to (0,6), which has only one bomb flagged at (0,7). Therefore, (1,5) is safe to reveal, providing more information to proceed safely.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,5,false", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F _\n1 1 1 1 _ _ 1 2 . 1 _\n2 . . 1 _ _ 1 F 2 1 _\n3 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 2 2 2\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 . .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 . .\n8 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}

Here's how we'll approach it:\n\n1. **Check all revealed numbers against existing flags:** Ensure that the number of flags adjacent to a numbered tile matches the number displayed.\n\n2. **Look for obvious conflicts:** For example, if a '1' has two adjacent flags, that's a conflict.\n\n3. **Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs:** We have 8 flags remaining and 10 bombs, so we need to be strategic in flag placements.\n\n4. **Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile:** Based on the analysis, we'll choose the safest move.\n\n### **Step 1: Checking Revealed Numbers Against Flags**\n\nLet's examine each numbered tile and verify if the adjacent flags match the number.\n\n#### **Tile (0,6): '1'**\n- Adjacent tiles: (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)\n- Existing flag at (0,8)\n- Since (0,8) is to the right of (0,7), it's adjacent to (0,7).\n- Therefore, one flag is adjacent, which matches the '1'. No conflict here.\n\n#### **Tile (0,7): '1'**\n- Adjacent tiles: (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)\n- Existing flag at (0,8)\n- One flag adjacent, matching the '1'. No conflict.\n\n#### **Tile (1,6): '2'**\n- Adjacent tiles: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n- Existing flags: None adjacent\n- Number is '2', so we expect two bombs here. No flags yet, so we need to look for potential bomb locations.\n\n#### **Tile (1,7): '2'**\n- Adjacent tiles: (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n- Existing flag at (0,8)\n- One flag adjacent; needs one more bomb.

Potential spots: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)\n\n#### **Tile (5,6): '1'**\n- Adjacent tiles: (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n- Existing flag at (2,6) (not adjacent)\n- Number is '1'; needs one bomb adjacent. Potential spots: (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\n#### **Tile (6,6): '2'**\n- Adjacent tiles: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n- Existing flag at (2,6) (not adjacent)\n- Number is '2'; needs two bombs adjacent. Potential spots: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n#### **Tile (7,6): '1'**\n- Adjacent tiles: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)\n- Existing flag at (2,6) (not adjacent)\n- Number is '1'; needs one bomb adjacent. Potential spots: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)\n\n#### **Tile (8,6): '1'**\n- Adjacent tiles: (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n- Existing flag at (2,6) (not adjacent)\n- Number is '1'; needs one bomb adjacent. Potential spots: (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Conflicts**\n\nLooking at the above analysis, we don't see any immediate conflicts where a number has more adjacent flags than its value. However, we need to ensure that our flag placements don't create any such conflicts.\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Remaining Flags vs Bombs**\n\nWe have 8 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total. This means there are still 2 bombs that are not flagged. Our goal is to identify and flag these remaining bombs safely.\n\n### **Step 4: Deciding on the Next Move**\n\nBased on the analysis, we'll look for the safest move\u2014either revealing a tile or placing a flag where we're confident a bomb exists.\n\n#### **Potential Flag Placement:**\n\nLooking back at **Tile (1,6): '2'**, we notice that there are no flags adjacent to it. This means there must be two bombs in its adjacent tiles: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7).\n\nWe already have a flag at (2,6), so that's one bomb. We need one more bomb among the remaining adjacent tiles.\n\nLet's examine these tiles:\n\n- **(0,5): '.'** (unexplored)\n- **(0,6): '1'** (revealed)\n- **(0,7): '1'** (revealed)\n- **(1,5): '.'** (unexplored)\n- **(1,7): '2'** (revealed)\n- **(2,5): '.'** (unexplored)\n- **(2,7): '2'** (revealed)\n\nGiven that (1,6) requires one more bomb, we can consider flagging one of the unexplored adjacent tiles: (0,5), (1,5), or (2,5).\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that flagging any of these doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\n#### **Checking Tile (0,5): '.'**\n\nIf we flag (0,5):\n\n- **Adjacent to (0,6): '1'**\n  - Adjacent flags: (0,5) (if flagged)\n  - Already has one flag at (0,8), which is not adjacent.\n  - This would mean (0,6) would have one adjacent flag, which matches its value. No conflict.\n\n- **Adjacent to (1,5): '.'**\n  - No immediate conflict.\n\n- **Adjacent to (1,6): '2'**\n  - Already has one flag at (2,6); adding (0,5) would make two flags, matching the number. No conflict.\n\nThis seems safe.\n\n#### **Checking Tile (1,5): '.'**\n\nIf we flag (1,5):\n\n- **Adjacent to (1,6): '2'**\n  - Already has one flag at (2,6); adding (1,5) would make two flags, matching the number. No conflict.\n\n- **Adjacent to (2,5): '.'**\n  - No immediate conflict.\n\nThis also seems safe.\n\n#### **Checking Tile (2,5): '.'**\n\nIf we flag (2,5):\n\n- **Adjacent to (1,5): '.'**\n  - No immediate conflict.\n\n- **Adjacent to (2,6): 'F'** (already flagged)\n  - No conflict.\n\nThis seems safe as well.\n\n#### **Choosing the Safest Flag Placement**\n\nSince all three potential flag placements\u2014(0,5), (1,5), and (2,5)\u2014seem safe, we can choose any of them. To minimize risk, we'll choose the one that affects the fewest other tiles.\n\nLet's choose **(1,5)** as it's centrally located and affects fewer adjacent numbers compared to (0,5) or (2,5).\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** After analyzing the board, I've determined that placing a flag at (1,5) is safe. This move aligns with the number '2' at (1,6), which requires two adjacent bombs. Since there's already a flag at (2,6), flagging (1,5) completes the required two bombs without conflicting with any revealed numbers.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,5,true", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F _\n1 1 1 1 _ _ 1 2 . 1 _\n2 . . 1 _ _ 1 F 2 1 _\n3 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 2 2 2\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 . .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 . .\n8 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}

This means there are 5 more bombs to be flagged or revealed.\n\n### Step 4: Decide Whether to Place a New Flag or Reveal a Tile\n\nBased on the above analysis, I'll look for safe moves to reveal or determine where to place a flag.\n\n- **Tile (5,9):** Unexplored (.), and considering the surrounding tiles, it might be safe to reveal.\n  \n- **Tile (6,8):** Unexplored (.), and given the numbers around it, revealing it could provide more information.\n\nHowever, before revealing, I notice that tile (3,9) shows '2' with one adjacent flag at (3,8). There must be one more bomb adjacent to (3,9). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (2,8), (2,9), (3,8) (already flagged), and (4,8). Tile (2,8) is adjacent to tile (2,7), which is flagged, and tile (2,8) itself is unexplored. Given that tile (2,7) is flagged, tile (2,8) might be safe to reveal.\n\nBut since tile (3,9) requires one more bomb adjacent, and considering the existing flags, tile (4,8) is a strong candidate for placing a flag.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (3,9) shows '2' with one adjacent flag at (3,8). To satisfy the '2', there must be one more bomb adjacent to (3,9). The only unexplored adjacent tile is (4,8), so placing a flag here ensures the number is correctly represented.\n\n**MOVE:** 4,8,true", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F _\n1 1 1 1 _ _ F F . 1 _\n2 . . 1 _ _ 1 F 2 1 _\n3 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 F 2 2\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 . .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 . .\n8 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}

This means that none of the other adjacent squares can be bombs.\n\n#### **Rule 3: If a numbered tile shows '2' with only one adjacent flag, there MUST be another bomb adjacent.**\n\nLooking at (6,5), which is a '2', and there's only one flag at (3,8), which is not adjacent. Therefore, among its adjacent squares, there must be two bombs.\n\n#### **Rule 4: Before placing a new flag, verify that it doesn't conflict with the numbers you can see.**\n\nWe need to ensure that placing a flag doesn't violate the number constraints on adjacent tiles.\n\n#### **Rule 5: If you see a potential conflict between a flag and revealed numbers, consider removing the flag.**\n\nThis would involve reassessing whether the flag is correctly placed.\n\n### **Applying the Rules to Determine the Next Move**\n\nLet's apply these rules to find the most logical next move.\n\n#### **Examining Position (0,6): '1' with Adjacent Flag at (0,8)**\n\nSince (0,6) is a '1' and has an adjacent flag at (0,8), the other adjacent squares must be safe. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,5): Unexplored (.)\n- (0,7): '1'\n- (1,5): 'F' (Flag)\n- (1,6): 'F' (Flag)\n- (1,7): '.'\n\nGiven that (0,8) is flagged and (1,5) and (1,6) are also flagged, these flags are not directly adjacent to (0,6). However, we can deduce that (0,5) and (0,7) are safe since (0,6) is '1' with one adjacent flag at (0,8).\n\nBut wait, (0,7) is already revealed as '1', so it's already safe. Therefore, (0,5) is the only unexplored adjacent square, and since (0,6) is '1' with one adjacent flag at (0,8), (0,5) must be safe.\n\n**Potential Move:** Reveal (0,5)\n\nHowever, before making this move, let's see if there are more pressing or safer moves elsewhere.\n\n#### **Examining Position (1,0): '1' with No Adjacent Flags**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (0,0): '_' (Empty)\n- (0,1): '_' (Empty)\n- (1,1): '1'\n- (2,0): '.' (Unexplored)\n- (2,1): '.' (Unexplored)\n\nSince (1,0) is '1' and there are no adjacent flags, there must be exactly one bomb among its adjacent unexplored squares: (2,0) and (2,1).\n\nWe need more information to determine which of these is the bomb, so this doesn't immediately suggest a move.\n\n#### **Examining Position (2,2): '1' with No Adjacent Flags**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (1,1): '1'\n- (1,2): '1'\n- (1,3): '1'\n- (2,1): '.' (Unexplored)\n- (2,3): '.' (Unexplored)\n- (3,1): '1'\n- (3,2): '1'\n- (3,3): '1'\n\nSince (2,2) is '1' and there are no adjacent flags, there must be exactly one bomb among its adjacent unexplored squares: (2,1) and (2,3).\n\nAgain, we need more information to determine which one is the bomb.\n\n#### **Examining Position (3,0): '1' with No Adjacent Flags**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (2,0): '.' (Unexplored)\n- (2,1): '.' (Unexplored)\n- (3,1): '1'\n- (4,0): '_' (Empty)\n- (4,1): '_' (Empty)\n\nSince (3,0) is '1' and there are no adjacent flags, there must be exactly one bomb among its adjacent unexplored squares: (2,0) and (2,1).\n\nThis is similar to position (1,0) and doesn't provide an immediate move.\n\n#### **Examining Position (4,5): '1' with Adjacent Flag at (3,8)**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (3,4): '_' (Empty)\n- (3,5): '_' (Empty)\n- (3,6): '1'\n- (4,4): '_' (Empty)\n- (4,6): '1'\n- (5,4): '_' (Empty)\n- (5,5): '1'\n- (5,6): '.' (Unexplored)\n\n(3,8) is flagged but it's not adjacent to (4,5). Therefore, (4,5) is '1' with no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb among its adjacent unexplored squares: (5,6).\n\n**Potential Move:** Reveal (5,6)\n\nBut before proceeding, let's see if this is the most logical move.\n\n#### **Examining Position (5,5): '1' with Adjacent Flag at (3,8)**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (4,4): '_' (Empty)\n- (4,5): '1'\n- (4,6): '1'\n- (5,4): '_' (Empty)\n- (5,6): '.' (Unexplored)\n- (6,4): '_' (Empty)\n- (6,5): '2'\n- (6,6): '.' (Unexplored)\n\n(3,8) is flagged but not adjacent to (5,5). Therefore, (5,5) is '1' with no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb among its adjacent unexplored squares: (5,6) and (6,6).\n\nThis doesn't provide an immediate move.\n\n#### **Examining Position (6,5): '2' with Adjacent Flag at (3,8)**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (5,4): '_' (Empty)\n- (5,5): '1'\n- (5,6): '.' (Unexplored)\n- (6,4): '_' (Empty)\n- (6,6): '.' (Unexplored)\n- (7,4): '_' (Empty)\n- (7,5): '1'\n- (7,6): '1'\n\n(3,8) is flagged but not adjacent to (6,5). Therefore, (6,5) is '2' with no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly two bombs among its adjacent unexplored squares: (5,6) and (6,6).\n\nThis means both (5,6) and (6,6) are bombs.\n\n**Potential Moves:** Flag (5,6) and Flag (6,6)\n\nBut we need to verify if flagging these squares conflicts with any other numbers.\n\nLet's check:\n\n- **Position (5,5): '1' with Adjacent (5,6) and (6,6)**\n  - If both are bombs, this would mean (5,5) has two adjacent bombs, which contradicts its value of '1'. Therefore, both cannot be bombs.\n\nThis indicates a conflict, so our assumption that both (5,6) and (6,6) are bombs is incorrect. Therefore, at least one of them is safe.\n\nGiven that (6,5) is '2' and there are no adjacent flags, there must be exactly two bombs among (5,6) and (6,6). However, since (5,5) is '1' and adjacent to (5,6) and (6,6), only one of them can be a bomb.\n\nThis suggests that our initial analysis was flawed. Let's reassess.\n\n#### **Re-examining Position (6,5): '2' with Adjacent Flag at (3,8)**\n\nGiven that (6,5) is '2' and there are no adjacent flags, there must be exactly two bombs among its adjacent unexplored squares: (5,6) and (6,6).\n\nHowever, (5,5) is '1' and adjacent to (5,6) and (6,6). If both (5,6) and (6,6) were bombs, (5,5) would have two adjacent bombs, which contradicts its value of '1'.\n\nTherefore, only one of (5,6) and (6,6) can be a bomb.\n\nThis means that (6,5) cannot have two adjacent bombs, leading to a contradiction. This suggests that our earlier assumption is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps there's an error in our analysis. Let's consider that (3,8) is flagged and adjacent to (6,5).\n\nWait, (3,8) is at row 3, column 8, and (6,5) is at row 6, column 5. These positions are not adjacent (they are three rows apart and three columns apart), so (3,8) is not adjacent to (6,5).\n\nTherefore, (6,5) is '2' with no adjacent flags, and there must be exactly two bombs among its adjacent unexplored squares: (5,6) and (6,6).\n\nBut (5,5) is '1' and adjacent to (5,6) and (6,6), meaning only one of them can be a bomb.\n\nThis is a contradiction because (6,5) requires two bombs among (5,6) and (6,6), but (5,5) only allows one.\n\nThis suggests that one of our assumptions is wrong. Perhaps there's another bomb adjacent to (6,5) that we're missing.\n\nLet's re-examine the adjacent squares of (6,5):\n\n- (5,4): '_' (Empty)\n- (5,5): '1'\n- (5,6): '.' (Unexplored)\n- (6,4): '_' (Empty)\n- (6,6): '.' (Unexplored)\n- (7,4): '_' (Empty)\n- (7,5): '1'\n- (7,6): '1'\n\nUpon closer inspection, (5,4), (6,4), and (7,4) are all empty, so they cannot be bombs.\n\nTherefore, the only possible bombs adjacent to (6,5) are (5,6) and (6,6). But since (5,5) is '1' and adjacent to (5,6) and (6,6), only one of them can be a bomb.\n\nThis conflict suggests that there might be an error in the board state or our interpretation. However, since we're assuming the board state is correct, we need to find a way to resolve this.\n\nPerhaps there's a bomb in one of the unexplored squares that we're not considering. Let's look at the unexplored squares adjacent to (6,5): (5,6) and (6,6).\n\nGiven that (5,5) is '1' and adjacent to both, only one can be a bomb. Therefore, (6,5) cannot have two bombs, which contradicts its value of '2'.\n\nThis indicates that our initial analysis is flawed. Let's try a different approach.\n\n#### **Alternative Approach: Checking for Conflicting Flags**\n\nLooking back at the flagged positions, perhaps some flags are incorrectly placed, causing the conflicts.\n\nLet's list all flagged positions:\n\n- (0,8)\n- (1,5)\n- (1,6)\n- (3,8)\n\nLet's check if these flags are correctly placed based on the adjacent numbers.\n\n**Flag at (0,8):**\nAdjacent to (0,7): '1'\nSince (0,7) is '1' and (0,8) is flagged, this seems correct.\n\n**Flag at (1,5):**\nAdjacent to (1,4): '_' (Empty)\nAdjacent to (1,6): 'F' (Flag)\nAdjacent to (0,5): '.' (Unexplored)\nAdjacent to (0,6): '1'\nAdjacent to (2,5): '.' (Unexplored)\nAdjacent to (2,6): '1'\n\nWe need to verify if (1,5) is correctly flagged.\n\nLooking at (0,6): '1' with adjacent flag at (0,8), so (0,6) has one bomb at (0,8).\n\nLooking at (1,6): 'F' (Flag), adjacent to (1,5).\n\nSince (1,6) is flagged and adjacent to (1,5), and (0,6) already has one bomb at (0,8), there should be no other bombs adjacent to (1,5).\n\nTherefore, (1,5) should not be a bomb, meaning the flag at (1,5) is incorrect.\n\n**Flag at (1,6):**\nAdjacent to (1,5): 'F' (Flag)\nAdjacent to (1,7): '.' (Unexplored)\nAdjacent to (0,6): '1'\nAdjacent to (0,7): '1'\nAdjacent to (2,6): '1'\nAdjacent to (2,7): 'F' (Flag)\n\nLooking at (0,7): '1' with adjacent flag at (0,8), so (0,7) has one bomb at (0,8).\n\nLooking at (2,6): '1' with adjacent flag at (2,7): 'F' (Flag), so (2,6) has one bomb at (2,7).\n\nTherefore, (1,6) should not be a bomb, meaning the flag at (1,6) is incorrect.\n\n**Flag at (3,8):**\nAdjacent to (3,7): '1'\nAdjacent to (3,9): '2'\nAdjacent to (2,7): 'F' (Flag)\nAdjacent to (2,8): '1'\nAdjacent to (4,7): '2'\nAdjacent to (4,8): 'F' (Flag)\n\nLooking at (3,7): '1' with adjacent flag at (3,8), so (3,7) has one bomb at (3,8).\n\nLooking at (3,9): '2' with adjacent flag at (3,8), so (3,9) has one bomb at (3,8) and needs one more bomb among its adjacent squares.\n\nHowever, since (3,8) is already flagged, there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (3,9), which contradicts its value of '2'.\n\nThis indicates that the flag at (3,8) is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the flags at (1,5), (1,6), and (3,8) are likely incorrectly placed.\n\n### **Correcting the Flags**\n\nGiven that some flags are likely incorrect, we should remove them to resolve the conflicts.\n\n**Removing Flag at (1,5):**\nAdjacent to (0,5): '.' (Unexplored)\nSince (0,6) is '1' with adjacent flag at (0,8), (0,5) must be safe.\n\n**Removing Flag at (1,6):**\nAdjacent to (1,7): '.' (Unexplored)\nSince (0,7) is '1' with adjacent flag at (0,8), (1,7) could be a bomb.\n\n**Removing Flag at (3,8):**\nAdjacent to (3,7): '1' with adjacent flag at (3,8).\nSince we're removing the flag at (3,8), (3,7) now needs to have one bomb adjacent.\n\nHowever, removing these flags may affect other numbers, so we need to be cautious.\n\n### **Determining the Next Move**\n\nGiven the conflicts identified, the safest move is to remove the flag at (1,5) since it seems most likely to be incorrectly placed.\n\n**Potential Move:** Remove flag at (1,5)\n\nHowever, before doing that, let's consider revealing a safe square that can provide more information.\n\nLooking back at position (0,5):\n\n- Adjacent to (0,6): '1' with adjacent flag at (0,8)\n- Therefore, (0,5) must be safe.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nTo proceed safely and gather more information, the best move is to reveal (0,5).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The number '1' at (0,6) has an adjacent flag at (0,8), indicating that (0,5) is safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,5,false", "flags_remaining": 4, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F _\n1 1 1 1 _ _ F F . 1 _\n2 . . 1 _ _ 1 F 2 1 _\n3 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 F 2 2\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 F .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 . .\n8 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}

Adjacent tiles are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7).\n  - (0,7) is flagged (`F`). So, there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to (0,6). Since (0,7) is already flagged, the other adjacent tiles ((0,5), (1,5), (1,6)) must be safe.\n\n- **Tile (0,7):** Shows `1`. Adjacent tiles are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8).\n  - (0,6) is `1`, (1,6) is flagged (`F`). Wait, tile (1,6) is flagged. So, tile (0,7) already has one adjacent bomb flagged at (1,6). Therefore, the other adjacent tiles ((0,8), (1,7), (1,8)) must be safe.\n\nWait a minute, this seems conflicting. Let's double-check.\n\nLooking back at Tile (0,6): It's `1` with (0,7) flagged. So, (0,7) is the bomb adjacent to (0,6). Therefore, (0,5), (1,5), (1,6) are safe.\n\nTile (0,7): It's `1` with (1,6) flagged. So, (1,6) is the bomb adjacent to (0,7). Therefore, (0,8), (1,7), (1,8) are safe.\n\nBut tile (0,7) is also adjacent to (0,6), which is `1`. This seems consistent because (0,6) has one bomb adjacent (0,7), and (0,7) has one bomb adjacent (1,6).\n\nSo, no conflicts here.\n\n**Step 2: Examine Tile (1,2):** Shows `1`. Adjacent tiles are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n  - We need to find exactly one bomb among these tiles.\n  - Let's see if any are already flagged or revealed as bombs.\n  - Tile (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are all unexplored (`_` or `.`).\n  - Since we don't have any flags here, we need to look for clues.\n\n**Step 3: Look at Tile (2,2):** Shows `1`. Adjacent tiles are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n  - Tile (1,2) is the same tile we're examining.\n  - Tile (2,1) and (2,3) are unexplored.\n  - Tile (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are all `1`.\n  - This suggests that there might be a bomb in the vicinity, but without more information, it's hard to pinpoint.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Tile (3,2):** Shows `1`. Adjacent tiles are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n  - Tile (2,2) is `1`.\n  - Tile (3,1) and (3,3) are `1`.\n  - This area is quite crowded with `1`s, indicating that bombs might be nearby.\n\n**Step 5: Examine Tile (4,7):** Shows `F` (flagged). Adjacent tiles are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8).\n  - Tile (3,7) is `F` (flagged).\n  - Tile (5,7) is `.`, unexplored.\n  - This suggests that there's a bomb at (4,7), but let's verify.\n\nWait, looking back at the board, tile (4,7) is flagged (`F`). So, we're assuming there's a bomb there.\n\n**Step 6: Verify Tile (3,7):** Shows `F` (flagged). Adjacent tiles are (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8).\n  - Tile (2,7) is `F` (flagged).\n  - Tile (4,7) is `F` (flagged).\n  - So, tiles (3,7) and (4,7) are both flagged.\n  - Let's check Tile (3,6): Shows `1`. Adjacent tiles are (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7).\n    - Tile (2,7) is flagged.\n    - Tile (3,7) is flagged.\n    - Wait, but Tile (3,6) is `1`, and it has two flagged adjacent tiles ((2,7) and (3,7)). This is a conflict because a `1` tile should have only one adjacent bomb.\n\nThis indicates a mistake in flag placement. According to the rules, a `1` tile cannot have more than one adjacent bomb. Here, Tile (3,6) is `1` with two adjacent flags, which violates the rules.\n\n**Step 7: Resolving the Conflict**\n\nSince Tile (3,6) is `1` and has two adjacent flags, one of these flags must be incorrect. Let's examine Tile (2,7) and Tile (3,7).\n\n- **Tile (2,7):** Shows `F` (flagged). Adjacent tiles are (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8).\n  - Tile (1,7) is flagged.\n  - Tile (3,7) is flagged.\n  - Tile (2,6) is `1`.\n  - Let's check Tile (2,6): Shows `1`. Adjacent tiles are (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7).\n    - Tile (1,7) is flagged.\n    - Tile (2,7) is flagged.\n    - Tile (2,6) is `1` with two adjacent flags, which is again a conflict.\n\nThis suggests that both flags at (2,7) and (3,7) might be incorrect. However, removing both flags would mean that Tile (2,6) and Tile (3,6) have no adjacent bombs, which contradicts their numerical values.\n\nTherefore, only one of these flags can be correct. Let's determine which one is likely correct.\n\n**Step 8: Re-evaluating Flags**\n\nLet's consider Tile (1,7): Shows `1`. Adjacent tiles are (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8).\n  - Tile (1,6) is flagged.\n  - Tile (1,7) is `1`, so it should have exactly one adjacent bomb.\n  - Therefore, the bomb must be at (1,6), and the other adjacent tiles are safe.\n\nThis suggests that the flag at (1,6) is correct.\n\nNow, looking back at Tile (2,7): It's flagged. Let's see if this is necessary.\n\n**Step 9: Checking Tile (2,7)**\n\nTile (2,7): Shows `F` (flagged). Adjacent tiles are (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8).\n  - Tile (1,6) is flagged.\n  - Tile (1,7) is `1`.\n  - Tile (2,6) is `1`.\n  - Tile (3,7) is flagged.\n\nTile (2,6): Shows `1`. Adjacent tiles are (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7).\n  - Tile (1,6) is flagged.\n  - Tile (2,7) is flagged.\n  - Tile (2,6) is `1` with two adjacent flags, which is a conflict.\n\nThis indicates that the flag at (2,7) is incorrect because it causes Tile (2,6) to have two adjacent bombs, which contradicts its value of `1`.\n\n**Step 10: Removing the Incorrect Flag**\n\nTherefore, the flag at (2,7) should be removed. Let's proceed to remove the flag at (2,7).\n\n### **Determining the Next Move**\n\nNow that we've identified that the flag at (2,7) is incorrect, our next move should be to remove that flag.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The flag at (2,7) causes a conflict with Tile (2,6), which is `1` and already has an adjacent bomb at (1,6). Therefore, the flag at (2,7) must be removed to resolve this inconsistency.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,7,true (This will remove the flag at (2,7), as `flag=true` on an already flagged square removes the flag.)\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The flag at (2,7) causes a conflict with Tile (2,6), which is `1` and already has an adjacent bomb at (1,6).

This indicates that one of these flags is incorrect.\n\n**Row 3:**\n```\n3 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 F 2 2\n```\n- The '1' at (3,1) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2) must be a bomb.\n- The '1' at (3,2) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3) must be a bomb.\n- The '1' at (3,3) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4) must be a bomb.\n- The '1' at (3,6) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7) must be a bomb.\n- The '1' at (3,7) has a flag at (3,8), so the other adjacent tiles (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8) must be safe.\n- The '2' at (3,9) has a flag at (3,8), so there must be one more bomb adjacent to it, which could be at (2,8), (2,9), (3,8), (4,8), (4,9).\n\n**Row 4:**\n```\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F F F\n```\n- The '1' at (4,6) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7) must be a bomb.\n- The '1' at (4,7) has flags at (4,8) and (4,9), which is a conflict because it should only have one bomb adjacent. This indicates that one of these flags is incorrect.\n\n**Row 5:**\n```\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n```\n- The '1' at (5,6) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7) must be a bomb.\n\n**Row 6:**\n```\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . .\n```\n- The '1' at (6,6) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7) must be a bomb.\n- The '2' at (6,7) has no adjacent flags, so two of its adjacent tiles (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8) must be bombs.\n\n**Row 7:**\n```\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 . .\n```\n- The '1' at (7,7) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8) must be a bomb.\n- The '1' at (7,8) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,7), (7,9) must be a bomb.\n\n**Row 8:**\n```\n8 1 1 2 1 1 _ F 1 . .\n```\n- The '1' at (8,0) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (7,0), (7,1), (8,1) must be a bomb.\n- The '1' at (8,1) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2) must be a bomb.\n- The '2' at (8,2) has no adjacent flags, so two of its adjacent tiles (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3) must be bombs.\n- The '1' at (8,3) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4) must be a bomb.\n- The '1' at (8,4) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5) must be a bomb.\n- The '1' at (8,8) has a flag at (8,7), so the other adjacent tiles (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9) must be safe.\n\n**Row 9:**\n```\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .\n```\n- The '1' at (9,4) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,3), (9,5) must be a bomb.\n- The '1' at (9,8) has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9) must be a bomb.\n\n### Identifying Conflicts\n\nFrom the analysis, I've identified two conflicts:\n\n1. **Row 2, Column 6 (2,6):** The '1' at (2,6) has flags at (2,7) and (2,8), but it should only have one bomb adjacent. This means one of these flags is incorrect.\n2. **Row 4, Column 7 (4,7):** The '1' at (4,7) has flags at (4,8) and (4,9), but it should only have one bomb adjacent. This means one of these flags is incorrect.\n\n### Resolving Conflicts\n\nSince all bombs are already flagged, these conflicts suggest that some flags are incorrectly placed. To resolve this, I need to remove one flag from each conflicting pair.\n\n**For (2,6):**\n- The '1' at (2,6) has flags at (2,7) and (2,8). Since it should only have one bomb adjacent, one of these flags is incorrect.\n- Looking at the '1' at (2,3), it has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles must be a bomb. The adjacent tiles are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4). None of these are flagged, so one of them must be a bomb.\n- Similarly, the '1' at (2,6) should only have one bomb adjacent, so one of the flags at (2,7) or (2,8) is incorrect.\n- Since all bombs are already flagged, and there are no other numbers indicating bombs in this area, I need to remove one of these flags.\n\n**For (4,7):**\n- The '1' at (4,7) has flags at (4,8) and (4,9). Since it should only have one bomb adjacent, one of these flags is incorrect.\n- Looking at the '1' at (4,6), it has no adjacent flags, so one of its adjacent tiles must be a bomb. The adjacent tiles are (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7). None of these are flagged, so one of them must be a bomb.\n- Similarly, the '1' at (4,7) should only have one bomb adjacent, so one of the flags at (4,8) or (4,9) is incorrect.\n- Since all bombs are already flagged, and there are no other numbers indicating bombs in this area, I need to remove one of these flags.\n\n### Deciding Which Flag to Remove\n\nSince all bombs are already flagged, and there are no other numbers indicating bombs in these areas, I need to remove one flag from each conflicting pair. However, since the game info states that there are 0 flags remaining, it's likely that all bombs have been correctly flagged, and these conflicts are due to incorrect flag placements.\n\nGiven that, I should remove one flag from each conflicting pair to resolve the conflicts.\n\n**For (2,6):**\n- I'll remove the flag at (2,7).\n\n**For (4,7):**\n- I'll remove the flag at (4,8).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince all bombs are already flagged, and I need to resolve the conflicts by removing incorrect flags, my next move will be to remove the flag at (2,7).\n\nEXPLANATION: The '1' at (2,6) has two adjacent flags, which is a conflict. Since all bombs are already flagged, I need to remove one of these flags to resolve the conflict. I choose to remove the flag at (2,7).\n\nMOVE: 2,7,false", "flags_remaining": 0, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F _\n1 1 1 1 _ _ F F . 1 _\n2 . . 1 _ _ 1 F F 1 _\n3 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 F 2 2\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F F F\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 . .\n8 1 1 2 1 1 _ F 1 . .\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}

The board is a 10x10 grid with various symbols representing revealed numbers, unexplored spaces, and flagged bombs.\n\n**Legend:**\n- `_` : Empty revealed space\n- `.` : Unexplored space\n- `F` : Flagged space (indicating a suspected bomb)\n- `1-8`: Number indicating adjacent bombs\n\n**Game Info:**\n- Board size: 10x10\n- Flags remaining: 0\n- Bombs: 10\n\n**Coordinates:**\n- `x` represents the row number (0 at the top)\n- `y` represents the column number (0 at the left)\n\n### **Analyzing the Board**\n\nLet's start by examining the revealed numbers and their adjacent tiles to identify potential bombs or safe tiles.\n\n#### **Row 0:**\n```\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F _\n```\n- At (0,6) and (0,7), both have a value of `1`, and there's a flag at (0,8).\n  \n**Analysis:**\n- The `1` at (0,6) indicates there is exactly one bomb in its adjacent tiles.\n- The adjacent tiles to (0,6) are: (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7).\n- **(0,7)** is already a `1`, and **(0,8)** is flagged as `F` (indicating a suspected bomb).\n- Since (0,6) requires exactly one bomb, and (0,8) is flagged, the other adjacent tiles must be safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Tiles (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), and (1,7) are safe and can be revealed.\n\n#### **Row 1:**\n```\n1 1 1 1 _ _ F F 1 _\n```\n- Tiles (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) all have a value of `1`.\n- Flags are present at (1,6) and (1,7).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Let's focus on (1,0) with a value of `1`.\n- Adjacent tiles: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1).\n- **(1,1)** is already a `1`.\n- Since (1,0) requires exactly one bomb and (1,1) is `1`, (0,0) and (0,1) must be safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Tiles (0,0) and (0,1) are safe and can be revealed.\n\n#### **Row 2:**\n```\n2 1 . 1 _ _ 1 F F 1 _\n```\n- Tiles (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) have values `2`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `F`, `F`, `1` respectively.\n- Flags at (2,6) and (2,7).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Focus on (2,0) with a value of `2`.\n- Adjacent tiles: (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).\n- **(1,0)** is `1`, **(1,1)** is `1`.\n- Since (2,0) requires two bombs, and there are no flags adjacent yet, (2,1) must be the second bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Tile (2,1) is a bomb and should be flagged.\n\n#### **Row 3:**\n```\n3 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 F 2 2\n```\n- Tiles (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7) have values `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `F`, `2`, `2` respectively.\n- Flag at (3,7).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Let's examine (3,0) with a value of `1`.\n- Adjacent tiles: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1).\n- **(2,0)** is `2`, **(3,1)** is `1`.\n- Since (3,0) requires exactly one bomb and (3,1) is `1`, (2,0) and (2,1) must be safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Tiles (2,0) and (2,1) are safe and can be revealed.\n\n#### **Row 4:**\n```\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F F F\n```\n- Tiles (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9) have values `1`, `1`, `F`, `F`, `F` respectively.\n- Flags at (4,7), (4,8), (4,9).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Focus on (4,5) with a value of `1`.\n- Adjacent tiles: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6).\n- **(3,5)** is `1`, **(4,6)** is `1`.\n- Since (4,5) requires exactly one bomb and (4,6) is `1`, (3,5) must be safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Tile (3,5) is safe and can be revealed.\n\n#### **Row 5:**\n```\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n```\n- Tile (5,5) has a value of `1`.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Adjacent tiles: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6).\n- **(4,5)** is `1`, **(5,6)** is unexplored.\n- Since (5,5) requires exactly one bomb and (4,5) is `1`, (5,6) must be safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Tile (5,6) is safe and can be revealed.\n\n#### **Row 6:**\n```\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . .\n```\n- Tiles (6,5), (6,6) have values `1`, `2`.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Focus on (6,6) with a value of `2`.\n- Adjacent tiles: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7).\n- **(5,5)** is `1`, **(6,5)** is `1`.\n- Since (6,6) requires two bombs and (5,5) is `1`, (5,6) must be the second bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Tile (5,6) is a bomb and should be flagged.\n\n#### **Row 7:**\n```\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 . .\n```\n- Tiles (7,6), (7,7) have values `1`, `1`.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Focus on (7,6) with a value of `1`.\n- Adjacent tiles: (6,5), (6,6), (7,5), (7,7).\n- **(6,5)** is `1`, **(7,7)** is `1`.\n- Since (7,6) requires exactly one bomb and (7,7) is `1`, (6,5) and (6,6) must be safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Tiles (6,5) and (6,6) are safe and can be revealed.\n\n#### **Row 8:**\n```\n8 1 1 2 1 1 _ F 1 . .\n```\n- Tiles (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7) have values `1`, `1`, `2`, `1`, `1`, `.`, `F`, `1` respectively.\n- Flag at (8,6).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Focus on (8,2) with a value of `2`.\n- Adjacent tiles: (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3).\n- **(8,1)** is `1`, **(8,3)** is `1`.\n- Since (8,2) requires two bombs and (8,1) and (8,3) are `1`, (7,1), (7,2), (7,3) must be safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Tiles (7,1), (7,2), and (7,3) are safe and can be revealed.\n\n#### **Row 9:**\n```\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .\n```\n- Tiles (9,4), (9,7) have values `1`, `1`.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Focus on (9,4) with a value of `1`.\n- Adjacent tiles: (8,3), (8,4), (9,3), (9,5).\n- **(8,3)** is `1`, **(9,5)** is unexplored.\n- Since (9,4) requires exactly one bomb and (8,3) is `1`, (9,3) and (9,5) must be safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Tiles (9,3) and (9,5) are safe and can be revealed.\n\n### **Identifying Safe Moves**\n\nBased on the above analysis, we've identified several safe tiles that can be revealed:\n\n- **(0,5)**: Safe\n- **(1,5)**: Safe\n- **(1,6)**: Safe\n- **(1,7)**: Safe\n- **(0,0)**: Safe\n- **(0,1)**: Safe\n- **(2,0)**: Safe\n- **(2,1)**: Safe\n- **(3,5)**: Safe\n- **(5,6)**: Safe\n- **(6,5)**: Safe\n- **(6,6)**: Safe\n- **(7,1)**: Safe\n- **(7,2)**: Safe\n- **(7,3)**: Safe\n- **(9,3)**: Safe\n- **(9,5)**: Safe\n\nAdditionally, we've identified **(2,1)** and **(5,6)** as bombs that should be flagged. However, since the user mentioned that there are `0` flags remaining, it's crucial to ensure that we don't exceed the flag limit.\n\n### **Determining the Next Move**\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- **Flags remaining:** 0\n- **Bombs remaining:** 10\n\nWe need to prioritize revealing safe tiles over placing flags, especially since we cannot place additional flags at this moment.\n\nAmong the identified safe tiles, let's choose the one that provides the most information or is most strategic.\n\n**Tile (1,5)**:\n- Adjacent to multiple revealed numbers, revealing it could provide further insights.\n\n**Tile (1,6)**:\n- Already adjacent to a flag, revealing it would confirm or deny the presence of a bomb, but since flags are limited, it's better to explore other tiles first.\n\n**Tile (1,7)**:\n- Similar to (1,6), adjacent to a flag, so revealing it might not yield new information.\n\n**Tile (0,5)**:\n- Adjacent to (0,6) which has a value of `1`, revealing it could help confirm the safety of surrounding tiles.\n\nGiven these considerations, **Tile (1,5)** seems like a strategic choice as it can provide information about its adjacent tiles, potentially leading to more safe revelations.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nAfter careful analysis, the most strategic move is to reveal **Tile (1,5)**.\n\n**Explanation:**\nRevealing Tile (1,5) is safe based on the adjacent numbers and existing flags. This move will provide more information about the surrounding tiles, helping to further narrow down the locations of the remaining bombs.\n\n**MOVE:**\n```\n1,5,false\n```", "flags_remaining": 0, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F _\n1 1 1 1 _ _ F F . 1 _\n2 1 . 1 _ _ 1 F F 1 _\n3 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 F 2 2\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F F F\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 . .\n8 1 1 2 1 1 _ F 1 . .\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}

The adjacent unexplored tiles are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), and (6,6). However, (4,5) and (4,6) are already revealed and safe, and (5,6) is unexplored.\n\nSince (5,5) is a '1' and there are no adjacent flags, one of the adjacent unexplored tiles must be a bomb. However, since all bombs are already flagged, this suggests that there might be an inconsistency. But given that there are no flags remaining, it's likely that (5,6) is safe to reveal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the safest move is to reveal the tile at (5,6) since it's adjacent to a '1' with no adjacent flags, and all bombs are already flagged.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (5,6) is safe because it's adjacent to a '1' with no adjacent flags, and all bombs are already flagged.\nMOVE: 5,6,false", "flags_remaining": 0, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F _\n1 1 1 1 _ _ F F . 1 _\n2 1 . 1 _ _ 1 F F 1 _\n3 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 F 2 2\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F F F\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . 3 2\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . 1 _\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n8 1 1 2 1 1 _ F 1 1 1\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": false}
