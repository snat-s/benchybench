The adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,5), (1,5), and (1,6). Since there are no flags adjacent to (0,6), one of these three tiles must be a bomb.\n   - At (1,7), the number '1' is revealed. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), and (2,8). However, (0,6) is already revealed as '1', so the bomb must be among the other unexplored tiles.\n   \n2. **Conflict Check**:\n   - No obvious conflicts exist between the numbers and flags on the board.\n\n3. **Remaining Flags and Bombs**:\n   - There are 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining. This means we need to carefully place flags only where we are certain there is a bomb.\n\n4. **Safe Reveals**:\n   - At (2,2), the number '2' is revealed, and it has no adjacent flags. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3). Since the number is '2', and no flags are adjacent, we cannot definitively place a flag here.\n   - At (3,2), the number '3' is revealed, and it has no adjacent flags. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3). Again, we cannot definitively place a flag here.\n\n5. **Next Move**:\n   - The safest move is to reveal a tile that is unlikely to be a bomb. Given the current state, the tile at (1,5) is a good candidate because it is adjacent to the '1' at (0,6), and there are no other clues suggesting it is a bomb.\n\n### EXPLANATION:\nThe tile at (1,5) is adjacent to the '1' at (0,6), and there are no other clues indicating it is a bomb.

However, there's one position that stands out:\n\n**Position (8,9): Shows `1`**\nAdjacent unexplored spaces: (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nLooking at the adjacent spaces:\n\n- **(7,8):** Unexplored\n- **(7,9):** Unexplored\n- **(8,8):** Unexplored\n- **(9,8):** Unexplored\n- **(9,9):** Unexplored\n\nSince there's only one bomb adjacent to five unexplored spaces, and I have no flags placed yet, I need to look at nearby numbers to see if I can deduce the bomb's location.\n\nLooking at **Position (8,8): Shows `2`**\nAdjacent unexplored spaces: (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nHere, there are two bombs adjacent to eight unexplored spaces. Let's see if any of these are shared with Position (8,9):\n\nShared adjacent spaces between (8,8) and (8,9):\n\n- **(7,8)**, **(7,9)**, **(8,9)**, **(9,8)**, **(9,9)**\n\nSince Position (8,9) requires only one bomb in these five spaces, and Position (8,8) requires two bombs in these same spaces plus others, it's possible that the bomb required by (8,9) is one of these shared spaces.\n\nBut this still doesn't give me a definitive answer. Let's look elsewhere.\n\n**Position (6,8): Shows `3`**\nAdjacent unexplored spaces: (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n\nHere, three bombs are adjacent to eight unexplored spaces. Let's see if any of these are connected to Position (8,9).\n\nLooking at **Position (8,9): Shows `1`**\nAdjacent unexplored spaces: (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nShared adjacent spaces between (6,8) and (8,9):\n\n- **(7,8)**, **(7,9)**, **(8,8)**, **(9,8)**, **(9,9)**\n\nAgain, overlapping spaces, but still not enough to pinpoint the bomb.\n\n### **Considering the Remaining Flags**\n\nAccording to the game info, there are 10 bombs remaining and 10 flags left. This means that every bomb must be flagged, and every flag must mark a bomb.\n\nGiven that, I need to be cautious when placing flags, ensuring that each flag corresponds to a definite bomb location.\n\n### **Looking for Definite Bomb Locations**\n\nLet's revisit **Position (8,9): Shows `1`**\nAdjacent unexplored spaces: (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nIf I can determine that one of these is a bomb, I can place a flag there. However, without more information, I can't be certain.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at **Position (5,9): Shows `1`**\nAdjacent unexplored spaces: (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9)\n\nHere, there's only one bomb adjacent to five unexplored spaces. Let's see if any of these are adjacent to other numbers that might provide clues.\n\nLooking at **Position (6,8): Shows `3`**\nAdjacent unexplored spaces: (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n\nWait, **Position (6,8)** is adjacent to **(5,9)**, which is one of the unexplored spaces adjacent to **Position (5,9)**.\n\nSo, **Position (6,8)** has three bombs adjacent, one of which could be at **(5,9)**.\n\nLet's assume that **(5,9)** is a bomb. If I place a flag there, then **Position (5,9)**'s adjacent spaces would have one less bomb to account for.\n\nBut let's verify this.\n\nIf **(5,9)** is a bomb, then:\n\n- **Position (5,9):** Adjacent unexplored spaces: (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9)\n\nWith one bomb at **(5,9)**, the remaining spaces don't need additional bombs for **Position (5,9)**.\n\nNow, looking at **Position (6,8): Shows `3`**\nAdjacent unexplored spaces: (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n\nIf **(5,9)** is a bomb, then **Position (6,8)** still needs two more bombs among the remaining seven unexplored spaces.\n\nThis seems plausible, but let's check for conflicts.\n\nIf **(5,9)** is a bomb, then **Position (5,9)**'s adjacent spaces:\n\n- **(4,8)**, **(4,9)**, **(5,8)**, **(6,8)**, **(6,9)**\n\nLet's see if any of these are adjacent to other numbers that might conflict with **(5,9)** being a bomb.\n\nLooking at **Position (4,8):** Shows `1`\nAdjacent unexplored spaces: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)\n\nIf **(5,9)** is a bomb, then **Position (4,8)** has its one bomb accounted for, and the remaining unexplored spaces can be safe.\n\nSimilarly, **Position (4,9):** Shows `1`\nAdjacent unexplored spaces: (3,8), (3,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9)\n\nIf **(5,9)** is a bomb, then **Position (4,9)** has its one bomb accounted for.\n\nTherefore, placing a flag at **(5,9)** seems reasonable and doesn't cause any conflicts with the existing numbers.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the above analysis, I've deduced that placing a flag at position **(5,9)** is a safe and logical move. This ensures that the bomb count for **Position (5,9)** is correctly accounted for and doesn't conflict with adjacent revealed numbers.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Placing a flag at (5,9) because it's logically deduced to be a bomb based on the adjacent numbers and bomb counts without causing any conflicts.\n\n**MOVE:** 5,9,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 . . .\n2 . . 2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n3 . . 3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n4 . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . . 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 3 .\n7 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n8 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 2 1\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}

Let's identify its adjacent squares:\n\n- (0,5): `_` (already revealed)\n- (0,7): `.` (unexplored)\n- (1,5): `_` (already revealed)\n- (1,6): `1` (already revealed)\n- (1,7): `F` (flagged)\n\nSince there's already one flag at (1,7), there cannot be any other bombs adjacent to (0,6). Therefore, the unexplored square at (0,7) is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** We can reveal (0,7).\n\n#### **Examining the Number '2' at (2,6):**\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n2 . . 2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n```\n\nThe '2' at (2,6) indicates there are two bombs in its adjacent squares.

The only unexplored adjacent square is (3,5).\n\n**Conclusion:** We can place a flag at (3,5).\n\n### **Updating the Board and Remaining Flags**\n\nAfter placing a flag at (3,5), we have 7 flags remaining.\n\n### **Checking for Other Opportunities**\n\nLet's look for other numbers with unexplored adjacent squares.\n\n#### **Examining the Number '3' at (3,2):**\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n3 . . 3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n```\n\nThe '3' at (3,2) indicates three bombs in its adjacent squares. Let's identify its adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,1): `.` (unexplored)\n- (2,2): `2` (already revealed)\n- (2,3): `_` (already revealed)\n- (3,1): `.` (unexplored)\n- (3,3): `_` (already revealed)\n- (4,1): `.` (unexplored)\n- (4,2): `3` (already revealed)\n- (4,3): `1` (already revealed)\n\nThere are no flags adjacent to (3,2), so we need to find three bombs among the unexplored squares: (2,1), (3,1), and (4,1).\n\nHowever, without additional information, it's challenging to determine which of these squares contain bombs. To proceed, we'll need to look at other numbers that might influence these squares.\n\n#### **Examining the Number '1' at (4,3):**\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n4 . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n```\n\nThe '1' at (4,3) indicates one bomb in its adjacent squares. Let's identify its adjacent squares:\n\n- (3,2): `3` (already revealed)\n- (3,3): `_` (already revealed)\n- (3,4): `_` (already revealed)\n- (4,2): `3` (already revealed)\n- (4,4): `1` (already revealed)\n- (5,2): `.` (unexplored)\n- (5,3): `.` (unexplored)\n- (5,4): `1` (already revealed)\n\nThere are no flags adjacent to (4,3), so the unexplored squares (5,2) and (5,3) could potentially contain a bomb.\n\nHowever, since we've already placed a flag at (3,5), and we're limited by the total number of bombs (10), we need to ensure that our flag placements don't exceed the bomb count.\n\n### **Re-evaluating Flag Placements**\n\nGiven that we've placed one flag at (3,5) and have 7 flags remaining, we need to be cautious about placing additional flags without sufficient evidence.\n\nLet's revisit the '3' at (3,2). Since we've already placed a flag at (3,5), which is adjacent to (3,2), we need to determine if this affects the number of bombs adjacent to (3,2).\n\nHowever, (3,5) is not directly adjacent to (3,2). Let's clarify adjacency:\n\n**Adjacent squares to (3,2):**\n- (2,1)\n- (2,2)\n- (2,3)\n- (3,1)\n- (3,3)\n- (4,1)\n- (4,2)\n- (4,3)\n\n(3,5) is not among these, so our flag at (3,5) doesn't directly impact the '3' at (3,2).\n\n### **Deciding the Next Move**\n\nGiven the analysis, the safest move is to reveal the square we determined earlier as safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** Reveal (0,7).\n\n### **Final Move**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The number '1' at (0,6) has one adjacent flag at (1,7), indicating that the unexplored square at (0,7) is safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 F . .\n2 . . 2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n3 . . 3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n4 . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . . 1 _ _ _ 1 F\n6 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 3 .\n7 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n8 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 2 1\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 8, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "### Understanding the Current Board State\n\nFirst, I'll take a moment to understand the current state of the Minesweeper board. Here's a summary of the revealed and unexplored areas:\n\n- **Row 0:** Columns 6 and 7 show a '1', Column 8 has a flag ('F'), and Column 9 is unexplored ('.').\n- **Row 1:** Columns 0 to 3 show '1's, Columns 6 shows '1', Column 8 has a flag ('F'), and Column 9 shows '2'.\n- **Row 2:** Columns 2 shows '2', Columns 6 shows '1', Columns 7 shows '1', and Column 8 shows '2'.\n- **Row 3:** Columns 2 shows '3', Columns 8 shows '1', and Column 9 shows '1'.\n- **Row 4:** Columns 2 shows '3', Columns 3 and 4 show '1's.\n- **Row 5:** Columns 4 shows '1', Columns 8 has a flag ('F'), and Column 9 shows '1'.\n- **Rows 6 to 9:** Mostly unexplored, with a few '1's scattered.\n\nThere are **7 flags** remaining, and the total number of **bombs** is **10**.\n\n### Step 1: Checking Existing Flags Against Revealed Numbers\n\nI'll start by verifying if the existing flags are correctly placed based on the adjacent numbers.\n\n#### Flag at (0,8):\n\n- Adjacent tiles: (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)\n  - (0,7): '1'\n  - (1,7): '1'\n  - (1,8): 'F' (another flag)\n  - (1,9): '2'\n\nLooking at (0,7) which shows '1' and has a flag at (0,8), this means there should be no other bombs adjacent to (0,7). However, (1,7) also shows '1' and is adjacent to (0,8). If (0,8) is a bomb, then (1,7) would only have one bomb adjacent, which aligns with its number. So, this flag seems correctly placed.\n\n#### Flag at (1,8):\n\n- Adjacent tiles: (0,7), (0,8), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n  - (0,7): '1'\n  - (0,8): 'F'\n  - (1,7): '1'\n  - (1,9): '2'\n  - (2,7): '1'\n  - (2,8): '2'\n  - (2,9): '.'\n  \nConsidering (1,9) shows '2', and there's already a flag at (1,8), there should be one more bomb adjacent to (1,9). Possible candidates are (2,8) or (2,9). Since (2,8) shows '2', which is consistent, and (2,9) is unexplored, it's likely that (2,9) is a bomb.\n\n#### Flag at (5,8):\n\n- Adjacent tiles: (4,7), (4,8), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)\n  - (4,7): '.'\n  - (4,8): '.'\n  - (5,7): '.'\n  - (5,9): '1'\n  - (6,7): '1'\n  - (6,8): '3'\n  - (6,9): '.'\n  \nLooking at (5,9) which shows '1' and has a flag at (5,8), this means there should be no other bombs adjacent to (5,9). Checking adjacent tiles, (4,8), (5,7), and (6,9) are unexplored. Since (5,9) requires only one bomb adjacent, and it's already satisfied by (5,8), these unexplored tiles should be safe.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Potential Conflicts\n\nAre there any revealed numbers that have more adjacent flags than their number indicates? Let's check:\n\n- **Tile (0,7):** '1' with flag at (0,8) \u2014 Correct, as only one bomb is adjacent.\n- **Tile (1,7):** '1' with flags at (0,8) and (1,8) \u2014 Wait, (1,7) shows '1', but it's adjacent to two flags. This is a conflict! A '1' should only have one bomb adjacent, but here it has two flags, implying two bombs. This inconsistency suggests that one of these flags might be incorrectly placed.\n\n### Step 3: Resolving the Conflict at (1,7)\n\nGiven that (1,7) shows '1' but has two adjacent flags at (0,8) and (1,8), one of these flags must be incorrect. Let's analyze:\n\n- **Flag at (0,8):** We earlier thought it was correctly placed based on (0,7).\n- **Flag at (1,8):** We saw that (1,9) shows '2' and already has one flag at (1,8), so there should be one more bomb adjacent to (1,9), likely at (2,9).\n\nNow, considering (2,9) is unexplored, let's assume it's a bomb. Then, (1,8) is correctly flagged as a bomb. Therefore, the flag at (0,8) must be the incorrect one because (1,7) can only have one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The flag at (0,8) is incorrectly placed.\n\n### Step 4: Deciding the Next Move\n\nBased on the conflict identified, the next move should be to remove the incorrectly placed flag at (0,8).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (1,7) shows '1' but has two adjacent flags at (0,8) and (1,8), indicating a conflict. Since (1,8) is likely correctly flagged as a bomb (supporting the '2' at (1,9)), the flag at (0,8) must be removed to resolve the inconsistency.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,8,true (Removing the flag at (0,8))\n\n*Note:* Typically, removing a flag would be represented by a move with `flag=true` on an already flagged square, but depending on the implementation, it might require setting `flag=false`. For clarity, in this context, setting `flag=true` on an already flagged square signifies toggling the flag off.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Removal of the Flag at (0,8)\n\nAfter removing the flag at (0,8):\n\n- **Tile (0,7):** '1' with no adjacent flags \u2014 This means there is one bomb adjacent. The possible adjacent tiles are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8).\n  - (0,6): '1'\n  - (0,8): Now unflagged and unexplored ('.')\n  - (1,6): '.'\n  - (1,7): '1'\n  - (1,8): 'F' (flagged)\n  \nSince (1,8) is flagged and (1,7) shows '1', which is already satisfied by (1,8), the remaining unexplored tiles adjacent to (0,7) \u2014 (0,8) \u2014 must be safe because (0,7) requires only one bomb adjacent, which is already accounted for by (1,8).\n\n### Step 6: Making the Next Safe Move\n\nNow that (0,8) is unflagged and confirmed safe, the next move should be to reveal it.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Removing the incorrect flag at (0,8) resolves the conflict at (1,7), and confirms that (0,8) is safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,8,false (Revealing tile at (0,8))\n\n### Step 7: Updating the Board After Revealing (0,8)\n\nAssuming the tile at (0,8) reveals a number or an empty space:\n\n- If it reveals '0' to '8', it will provide more information about adjacent bombs.\n- If it reveals an empty space ('_'), it means there are no adjacent bombs, and we can safely reveal its adjacent tiles.\n\nHowever, since we don't have the actual reveal, we'll proceed based on the logical deductions.\n\n### Step 8: Continuing the Analysis\n\nAfter revealing (0,8), we can re-examine adjacent numbers for further deductions:\n\n- **Tile (0,7):** '1' with adjacent tiles (0,8), (1,7), (1,8)\n  - (0,8): Revealed (assuming it's safe)\n  - (1,7): '1'\n  - (1,8): 'F'\n  \nSince (1,8) is flagged, and (0,7) shows '1', it's consistent. No further action needed here.\n\n- **Tile (1,7):** '1' with adjacent tiles (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n  - (0,7): '1'\n  - (0,8): Revealed (safe)\n  - (1,6): '.'\n  - (1,8): 'F'\n  - (2,6): '.'\n  - (2,7): '1'\n  - (2,8): '2'\n  \nGiven that (1,8) is flagged, and (1,7) shows '1', there should be no other bombs adjacent. Therefore, tiles (1,6) and (2,6) are safe to reveal.\n\n### Step 9: Making the Next Safe Reveal\n\nBased on the above analysis, revealing (1,6) is the next logical step.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (1,7) shows '1' with an adjacent flag at (1,8), confirming that (1,6) and (2,6) are safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,6,false (Revealing tile at (1,6))\n\n### Step 10: Proceeding Further\n\nAfter revealing (1,6), we'll update our analysis based on the new information. However, without knowing the exact reveal, we can consider possible scenarios:\n\n- If (1,6) reveals '0' to '8', it will help in determining adjacent bombs.\n- If it reveals '_', indicating no adjacent bombs, we can safely reveal its adjacent tiles.\n\nGiven the complexity and to maintain brevity, I'll conclude the analysis here, having demonstrated the process of resolving conflicts and making safe moves in Minesweeper.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThrough careful examination of the board, checking for conflicts between numbers and flags, and logically deducing the placement of bombs, I was able to identify and correct an incorrectly placed flag, leading to safe reveals and further progress in the game. This methodical approach ensures that each move is justified, minimizing the risk of triggering a mine.\n\n---\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Resolved a conflict at tile (1,7) by removing the incorrectly placed flag at (0,8), and subsequently revealing the now-safe tile at (0,8).\n\n**MOVE:** 0,8,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F .\n1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 F 2 .\n2 . . 2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n3 . . 3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n4 . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . . 1 _ _ _ 1 F\n6 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 3 .\n7 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n8 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 2 1\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}

Adjacent cells: `(0,5)`, `(0,7)`, `(1,5)`, `(1,6)`, `(1,7)`\n   - `(0,7)` is also a `1`, and `(0,8)` is flagged (`F`).\n   - Since `(0,8)` is flagged, it's likely the bomb adjacent to `(0,7)`.\n   - Therefore, `(0,6)` has one adjacent bomb (`(0,8)`), so its adjacent cells `(0,5)`, `(1,5)`, `(1,6)`, and `(1,7)` are safe.\n\n2. **Position `(0,7)` (Value: 1)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(0,6)`, `(0,8)`, `(1,6)`, `(1,7)`, `(1,8)`\n   - `(0,8)` is flagged (`F`), so it's the adjacent bomb.\n   - Thus, `(0,7)` has one adjacent bomb (`(0,8)`), making `(0,6)`, `(1,6)`, `(1,7)`, and `(1,8)` safe.\n\nBased on this analysis, cells `(0,5)`, `(1,5)`, `(1,6)`, and `(1,7)` can be safely revealed.\n\n#### **Row 1**\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 F 2 .\n```\n\n- Positions `(1,0)` to `(1,3)` and `(1,7)` show a `1`.\n- Position `(1,8)` is flagged (`F`).\n- Position `(1,9)` shows a `2`.\n\nLet's analyze each:\n\n1. **Position `(1,0)` (Value: 1)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(1,1)`, `(2,0)`, `(2,1)`\n   - Since `(1,1)` is also a `1`, and there are no flags adjacent to `(1,0)`, we need to determine where the bomb is.\n   - Possible bombs could be in `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(2,0)`, or `(2,1)`.\n\n2. **Position `(1,1)` (Value: 1)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,0)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`\n   - Similar to `(1,0)`, the bomb could be in any of these adjacent cells.\n\n3. **Position `(1,2)` (Value: 1)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(0,3)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,3)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`, `(2,3)`\n   - Again, the bomb could be in any of these cells.\n\n4. **Position `(1,3)` (Value: 1)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(0,2)`, `(0,3)`, `(0,4)`, `(1,2)`, `(1,4)`, `(2,2)`, `(2,3)`, `(2,4)`\n   - The bomb could be in any of these cells.\n\n5. **Position `(1,7)` (Value: 1)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(0,6)`, `(0,7)`, `(0,8)`, `(1,6)`, `(1,8)`, `(2,6)`, `(2,7)`, `(2,8)`\n   - `(1,8)` is flagged (`F`), so it's the adjacent bomb.\n   - Therefore, `(1,7)` has one adjacent bomb (`(1,8)`), making `(0,6)`, `(0,7)`, `(1,6)`, `(2,6)`, `(2,7)`, and `(2,8)` safe.\n\n6. **Position `(1,8)` (Value: F)**\n   - This is already flagged as a suspected bomb.\n\n7. **Position `(1,9)` (Value: 2)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(0,8)`, `(0,9)`, `(1,8)`, `(2,8)`, `(2,9)`\n   - `(1,8)` is flagged (`F`), so it's one of the two adjacent bombs.\n   - Therefore, there must be one more bomb among `(0,8)`, `(0,9)`, `(2,8)`, and `(2,9)`.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can deduce that:\n\n- Cells `(0,5)`, `(1,5)`, `(1,6)`, `(1,7)`, `(2,6)`, `(2,7)`, and `(2,8)` can be safely revealed.\n- We need to determine the location of the second bomb adjacent to `(1,9)`.\n\n#### **Row 2**\n\n```\n2 . . 2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n```\n\nLet's examine each cell:\n\n1. **Position `(2,0)` (Value: 2)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(1,0)`, `(1,1)`, `(2,1)`, `(3,0)`, `(3,1)`\n   - `(1,0)` and `(1,1)` are both `1`, so we need to determine where the two bombs are.\n   - Possible bombs could be in `(3,0)` or `(3,1)`.\n\n2. **Position `(2,3)` (Value: 2)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`, `(2,2)`, `(2,4)`, `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`\n   - We need to identify two bombs among these cells.\n\n3. **Position `(2,6)` (Value: 1)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(1,5)`, `(1,6)`, `(1,7)`, `(2,5)`, `(2,7)`, `(3,5)`, `(3,6)`, `(3,7)`\n   - From earlier analysis, `(1,7)` is safe, and `(1,8)` is flagged.\n   - We need to determine where the bomb is.\n\n4. **Position `(2,7)` (Value: 1)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(1,6)`, `(1,7)`, `(1,8)`, `(2,6)`, `(2,8)`, `(3,6)`, `(3,7)`, `(3,8)`\n   - `(1,8)` is flagged (`F`), so it's the adjacent bomb.\n   - Therefore, `(2,7)` has one adjacent bomb (`(1,8)`), making `(1,6)`, `(1,7)`, `(2,6)`, `(2,8)`, `(3,6)`, `(3,7)`, and `(3,8)` safe.\n\n5. **Position `(2,8)` (Value: 2)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(1,7)`, `(1,8)`, `(1,9)`, `(2,7)`, `(2,9)`, `(3,7)`, `(3,8)`, `(3,9)`\n   - `(1,8)` is flagged (`F`), so it's one of the two adjacent bombs.\n   - Therefore, there must be one more bomb among `(1,7)`, `(1,9)`, `(2,7)`, `(2,9)`, `(3,7)`, `(3,8)`, and `(3,9)`.\n\nFrom this, we can see that:\n\n- Cells `(1,5)`, `(1,6)`, `(1,7)`, `(2,5)`, `(3,5)`, `(3,6)`, `(3,7)`, `(3,8)`, and `(3,9)` can be safely revealed.\n- We need to determine the location of the second bomb adjacent to `(2,8)`.\n\n#### **Row 3**\n\n```\n3 . . 3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n```\n\nLet's analyze each cell:\n\n1. **Position `(3,0)` (Value: 3)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(2,0)`, `(2,1)`, `(3,1)`, `(4,0)`, `(4,1)`\n   - `(2,0)` is a `2`, so we need to determine where the three bombs are.\n\n2. **Position `(3,3)` (Value: 3)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(2,2)`, `(2,3)`, `(2,4)`, `(3,2)`, `(3,4)`, `(4,2)`, `(4,3)`, `(4,4)`\n   - We need to identify three bombs among these cells.\n\n3. **Position `(3,9)` (Value: 1)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(2,8)`, `(2,9)`, `(3,8)`, `(4,8)`, `(4,9)`\n   - `(2,8)` is a `2`, and `(2,9)` is unexplored.\n   - We need to determine where the bomb is.\n\n#### **Row 4**\n\n```\n4 . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n```\n\nLet's examine each cell:\n\n1. **Position `(4,2)` (Value: 3)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`, `(4,1)`, `(4,3)`, `(5,1)`, `(5,2)`, `(5,3)`\n   - We need to identify three bombs among these cells.\n\n2. **Position `(4,3)` (Value: 1)**\n   - Adjacent cells: `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`, `(4,2)`, `(4,4)`, `(5,2)`, `(5,3)`, `(5,4)`\n   - We need to determine where the bomb is.\n\n3. **Position `(4,4)` (Value: 1)**\n   -

It confirms whether this cell is safe and provides additional information to proceed with the game.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,5,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F .\n1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 F 2 .\n2 . . 2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n3 . . 3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n4 . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . . 1 _ _ _ 1 F\n6 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 3 .\n7 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n8 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 2 1\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}

Let's list them:\n\n1. **Positions Safe to Reveal:**\n   - (0,5)\n   - (1,5)\n   - (2,5)\n   - (2,9)\n   - (3,5)\n   - (3,6)\n   - (3,7)\n   - (3,8)\n   - (4,8)\n   - (5,6)\n   - (5,7)\n   - (6,6)\n   - (6,7)\n   - (6,8)\n   - (7,6)\n   - (7,7)\n   - (7,8)\n   - (8,6)\n   - (8,7)\n   - (9,6)\n   - (9,7)\n   - (9,8)\n\nAmong these, some are more promising based on the immediate context:\n\n- **Position (0,5):** Adjacent to (0,6) which is '1' with a flag at (1,7). Since the '1' is satisfied, this tile is safe.\n  \n- **Position (1,5):** Adjacent to (1,6) which is '1' with a flag at (1,7). The '1' is satisfied, so this tile is safe.\n  \n- **Position (2,5):** Adjacent to (2,6) which is '1' with a flag at (1,7). The '1' is satisfied, so this tile is safe.\n  \n- **Position (4,8):** Adjacent to (4,7) which is '1' with a flag at (5,8). The '1' is satisfied, so this tile is safe.\n  \n- **Position (5,6):** Adjacent to (5,7) which is '1' with a flag at (5,8). The '1' is satisfied, so this tile is safe.\n  \n- **Position (6,6):** Adjacent to (6,7) which is '1' with a flag at (5,8). The '1' is satisfied, so this tile is safe.\n  \n- **Position (6,7):** Adjacent to (6,8) which is '3' with a flag at (5,8). Since the '3' requires two more bombs, but adjacent tiles are safe, this tile is safe.\n  \n- **Position (7,6):** Adjacent to (7,7) which is '1'. There's no flag adjacent, so one of the adjacent tiles must be a bomb, but (7,6) itself is safe.\n  \n- **Position (7,7):** Adjacent to (7,8) which is unexplored. The '1' indicates one bomb among adjacent tiles, but since (7,6) is safe, (7,8) could be the bomb, but (7,7) itself is safe.\n  \n- **Position (8,6):** Adjacent to (8,7) which is '1'. The '1' indicates one bomb among adjacent tiles, but (8,6) itself is safe.\n  \n- **Position (9,6):** Adjacent to (9,7) which is '1'. The '1' indicates one bomb among adjacent tiles, but (9,6) itself is safe.\n\n### Step 4: Selecting the Next Move\n\nConsidering the above safe positions, I'll choose a tile that could reveal the most information or lead to further deductions. Let's select **Position (0,5)** as it's adjacent to a '1' with a satisfied flag, making it a safe bet.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Position (0,5)** is adjacent to (0,6) which is '1' with a flag at (1,7).\n- Since the '1' is already satisfied by the flag, (0,5) cannot contain a bomb.\n- Revealing this tile will provide more information about adjacent tiles, potentially leading to further safe moves.\n\n**MOVE:**\n```\nEXPLANATION: Position (0,5) is safe to reveal as it's adjacent to a '1' that's already satisfied by an existing flag.\nMOVE: 0,5,false\n```\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Move\n\nBefore finalizing, I'll double-check to ensure that revealing (0,5) doesn't conflict with any existing numbers or flags.\n\n- **Position (0,5):** Adjacent to (0,6): '1' with a flag at (1,7). Satisfied.\n  \n- **Position (1,5):** Adjacent to (1,6): '1' with a flag at (1,7). Satisfied.\n  \n- **Position (2,5):** Adjacent to (2,6): '1' with a flag at (1,7). Satisfied.\n\nAll adjacent numbers are consistent with the existing flags, confirming that (0,5) is indeed safe to reveal.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```\nEXPLANATION: Position (0,5) is safe to reveal as it's adjacent to a '1' that's already satisfied by an existing flag.\nMOVE: 0,5,false\n```", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 F .\n1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 F 2 .\n2 . . 2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n3 . . 3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n4 . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . . 1 _ _ _ 1 F\n6 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 3 .\n7 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n8 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 2 1\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}

If there's a mismatch, it could indicate a conflict or a potential bomb location.\n\n### Step 2: Look for obvious conflicts\n\nI'll scan the board for any numbers that have more adjacent flags than the number displayed. For example, if a tile shows '1' but has two adjacent flags, that's a conflict.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\n\nThere are 7 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total.

Since (1,6) shows '1', (1,5) must be safe.\n  \n- **Tile (2,5)**: Adjacent to (2,6) which has a flag at (1,7). Since (2,6) shows '1', (2,5) must be safe.\n  \n- **Tile (3,5)**: Adjacent to (2,6) which has a flag at (1,7). Since (2,6) shows '1', (3,5) must be safe.\n  \n- **Tile (4,5)**: Adjacent to (5,4) which shows '1'. Since there are no adjacent flags, (4,5) could be a bomb, but we need more information.\n  \n- **Tile (5,5)**: Adjacent to (5,4) which shows '1'.

(unexplored)\n  - (8,4): '1' (already revealed)\n  - (8,5): '_' (empty)\n  - (9,3): '.' (unexplored)\n  - (9,5): '_' (empty)\n  - No adjacent flags. So, there must be one bomb among (9,3).\n\n- (9,5): '_' (empty) - no need to consider.\n\n- (9,6): '_' (empty) - no need to consider.\n\n- (9,7): '_' (empty) - no need to consider.\n\n- (9,8): '_' (empty) - no need to consider.\n\n- (9,9): '_' (empty) - no need to consider.\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves and Potential Bombs\n\nFrom the above analysis, several tiles can be safely revealed or flagged:\n\n1. **Tile (1,7):** Adjacent to (0,6), (0,7), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). The number at (1,6) is '1' with an adjacent flag at (2,7), so (1,7) must be safe.\n   \n2. **Tile (2,1):** Adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). The number at (1,1) is '1' with no adjacent flags, so (2,1) must be a bomb.\n\n3. **Tile (3,1):** Adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). The number at (3,2) is '3' with an adjacent flag at (2,3), so (3,1) must be a bomb.\n\n4. **Tile (4,1):** Adjacent to (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). The number at (4,2) is '3' with no adjacent flags, so (4,1) must be a bomb.\n\n5. **Tile (5,2):** Adjacent to (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). The number at (5,3) is '1' with no adjacent flags, so (5,2) must be a bomb.\n\n6. **Tile (6,3):** Adjacent to (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). The number at (6,4) is '1' with no adjacent flags, so (6,3) must be a bomb.\n\n7. **Tile (7,3):** Adjacent to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). The number at (7,4) is '1' with no adjacent flags, so (7,3) must be a bomb.\n\n8. **Tile (8,3):** Adjacent to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). The number at (8,4) is '1' with no adjacent flags, so (8,3) must be a bomb.\n\n9. **Tile (9,3):** Adjacent to (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4). The number at (9,4) is '1' with no adjacent flags, so (9,3) must be a bomb.\n\n### Deciding the Next Move\n\nGiven the above analysis, the safest move is to reveal tile (1,7) since it is guaranteed to be safe based on the adjacent numbers and flags.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (1,7) is adjacent to (0,6), (0,7), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). The number at (1,6) is '1' with an adjacent flag at (2,7), so (1,7) must be safe.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,7,false", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n2 . . 2 F F _ 1 F 2 F\n3 . . 3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n4 . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . . 1 _ _ _ 1 F\n6 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 3 .\n7 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n8 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 2 1\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": false}
