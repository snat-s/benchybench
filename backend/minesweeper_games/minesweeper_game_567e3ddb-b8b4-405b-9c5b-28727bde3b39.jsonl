{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 3, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs, and I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after making this move, the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '3'. That means there are 3 bombs adjacent to this cell. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nSince it's my first move and I have no other information, I should flag the cells that are likely to be bombs based on this number. But I need to be careful not to overflag or underflag.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total, I need to use them wisely. Each flag I place should be as accurate as possible.\n\nLet's say I decide to flag three cells adjacent to the '3'. But which three? I need to look at the board and see if any of these adjacent cells are already revealed or have numbers that can give me more information.\n\nAssuming that no other cells are revealed yet, I can choose to flag any three of the eight adjacent cells. For now, I'll choose to flag (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5).\n\nSo, my next moves would be:\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\n\nMOVE: 3,4,true\n\nMOVE: 4,3,true\n\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged three cells, and I have 7 flags left. Next, I should reveal another cell that is not adjacent to the initial reveal to try to expand the board further.\n\nLet's choose (6,6) as another safe starting point.\n\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\n\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\nSuppose this reveals a '1'. Now, there is only one bomb adjacent to (6,6). The adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nI need to see if any of these are already flagged or revealed. Assuming none are flagged yet, I'll flag one of them, say (6,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\n\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged four cells, and I have 6 flags left.\n\nContinuing this process, I need to look for more numbers and adjust my flags accordingly. If I reveal a cell and it shows a '0', that means there are no bombs adjacent to it, and the game should automatically reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nLet's say I reveal (5,4) and it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nI already have flags on (4,3), (4,5), and (6,5). So, out of the eight adjacent cells to (5,4), three are flagged. The number shows '2', which means only two of the adjacent cells have bombs. But I have three flags there, which is a conflict.\n\nEXPLANATION: Conflict at (5,4): shows '2' but have 3 flags adjacent. Need to remove one flag.\n\nSo, I need to remove one of the flags. Let's remove the flag from (4,5).\n\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\nNow, (4,5) is no longer flagged, and I have 7 flags left again.\n\nContinuing, I reveal (5,5) to see what's there.\n\nEXPLANATION: Checking (5,5) for more information.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,false\n\nSuppose it reveals a '1'. Adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nI have flags on (4,3), (4,5), (6,5). Wait, (4,5) is no longer flagged. So, only two flags adjacent to (5,5). The number shows '1', so there should be one bomb adjacent. With two flags, that's a conflict.\n\nEXPLANATION: Conflict at (5,5): shows '1' but have 2 flags adjacent. Need to remove one flag.\n\nI need to remove one more flag. Let's remove the flag from (4,3).\n\nMOVE: 4,3,true\n\nNow, (4,3) is no longer flagged, and I have 8 flags left.\n\nContinuing this process, I need to carefully place and remove flags based on the numbers revealed and ensure that the number of flags around each numbered cell matches the number shown.\n\nThis is a meticulous process, and it's easy to make mistakes, especially with a larger board. It's crucial to keep track of the flags and the numbers and to double-check for any conflicts.\n\nAs I progress, I'll reveal more cells and place flags accordingly, always making sure that the number of flags around each numbered cell matches the number shown.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this Minesweeper problem, we need to methodically reveal safe cells and place flags on cells that contain bombs based on the numbers revealed on the board. The strategy involves starting from safe initial moves, using the numbers to deduce the positions of bombs, and iteratively revealing more cells or placing flags accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Moves:**\n   - The first move in Minesweeper is safe. Choose the center of the board to maximize the area revealed.\n   - Reveal the center cell (4,4).\n\n2. **Interpreting Numbers:**\n   - Each number indicates exactly how many bombs are in the adjacent 8 cells.\n   - If a cell shows '1', and there is already one adjacent flag, then the remaining adjacent cells are safe.\n   - If a cell shows '2', and there are already two adjacent flags, the remaining adjacent cells are safe, and so on.\n\n3. **Flag Placement:**\n   - Place flags on cells that are deduced to contain bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Remove flags if a conflict is found between the number and the flags.\n\n4. **Iterative Process:**\n   - Continue revealing cells and placing flags based on the information from the revealed numbers.\n   - Ensure that the number of flags around each numbered cell matches the number shown.\n\n5. **Conflict Resolution:**\n   - If a numbered cell has the correct number of adjacent flags, the remaining adjacent cells are safe to reveal.\n   - If there are more flags than the number indicates, remove excess flags.\n   - If there are fewer flags than the number indicates, place additional flags on unflagged adjacent cells.\n\n### Solution Code Structure\n\nThe solution involves a series of moves, each with an explanation of the reasoning behind the move. Due to the stochastic nature of Minesweeper, the exact sequence of moves can vary based on the initial bomb placement. However, the approach remains consistent.\n\n#### Sample Moves\n\n1. **First Move:**\n   - Reveal the center cell to start.\n     ```plaintext\n     EXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n     MOVE: 4,4,false\n     ```\n\n2. **Interpreting the Revealed Number:**\n   - Suppose (4,4) reveals a '3'. Flag three adjacent cells.\n     ```plaintext\n     EXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\n     MOVE: 3,4,true\n     MOVE: 4,3,true\n     MOVE: 4,5,true\n     ```\n\n3. **Expanding the Board:**\n   - Reveal another central but non-adjacent cell.\n     ```plaintext\n     EXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\n     MOVE: 6,6,false\n     ```\n\n4. **Handling Conflicts:**\n   - If a revealed number shows a conflict with existing flags, adjust the flags.\n     ```plaintext\n     EXPLANATION: Conflict at (5,4): shows '2' but have 3 flags adjacent. Need to remove one flag.\n     MOVE: 4,5,true  // Remove flag\n     ```\n\n5. **Continuing the Process:**\n   - Reveal more cells and place flags based on the numbers and existing flags.\n     ```plaintext\n     EXPLANATION: Checking (5,5) for more information.\n     MOVE: 5,5,false\n     ```\n\n### Solution Code\n\nThe solution code consists of a series of moves in the format `EXPLANATION: [reasoning]` followed by `MOVE: x,y,flag`, where `x` and `y` are the coordinates, and `flag` is `true` to place a flag or `false` to reveal the cell.\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\nMOVE: 3,4,true\nMOVE: 4,3,true\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\nEXPLANATION: Conflict at (5,4): shows '2' but have 3 flags adjacent. Need to remove one flag.\nMOVE: 4,5,true  // Remove flag\n\nEXPLANATION: Checking (5,5) for more information.\nMOVE: 5,5,false\n\nEXPLANATION: Conflict at (5,5): shows '1' but have 2 flags adjacent. Need to remove one flag.\nMOVE: 4,3,true  // Remove flag\n\n...  // Continue with similar moves based on the board's state\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nEach move is justified based on the current state of the board and the rules of Minesweeper. By following this methodical approach, we can safely reveal cells and accurately place flags to avoid hitting any bombs, ultimately solving the game.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left to find. I've got 10 flags remaining, which matches the number of bombs left.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the numbers and see where the bombs might be. Let's start from the top-left corner and work our way down.\n\nLooking at row 3 and column 2, there's a '1'. That means there's one bomb adjacent to this cell. Similarly, next to it is another '1', so that area has some bombs around it.\n\nMoving to row 4, column 2, there's another '1', and next to it is a '1' again, and then a '1' and a '3'. The '3' indicates that there are three bombs adjacent to that cell.\n\nIn row 5, there are '1's and some unknowns represented by '_'. I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me try to map out the possible bomb locations based on these numbers.\n\nStarting with the '3' in row 4, column 5. It has three bombs around it. Let's see the adjacent cells:\n\n- Above it: row 3, column 5: it's a '_ ', which is an empty revealed space, so no bomb there.\n\n- To the left: row 4, column 4: it's a '1', which is already a number, so no bomb there.\n\n- To the right: row 4, column 6: it's a '.', which is unexplored, so possibly a bomb.\n\n- Below it: row 5, column 5: it's a '1', which is a number, so no bomb there.\n\n- Diagonally above left: row 3, column 4: '.', unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally above right: row 3, column 6: '.', unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally below left: row 5, column 4: '_', empty, no bomb.\n\n- Diagonally below right: row 5, column 6: '1', no bomb.\n\nSo, out of these eight adjacent cells, only row 4, column 6; row 3, column 4; and row 3, column 6 are unexplored. Since the '3' needs three adjacent bombs, and only these three are possible locations, it must be that all three of these cells contain bombs.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because if all three are bombs, then row 5, column 5, which is a '1', would have more than one adjacent bomb, which contradicts the '1'. Let's check that.\n\nRow 5, column 5 is a '1'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- Above: row 4, column 5: '1'\n\n- Left: row 5, column 4: '_'\n\n- Right: row 5, column 6: '1'\n\n- Below: row 6, column 5: '_'\n\n- Diagonally above left: row 4, column 4: '1'\n\n- Diagonally above right: row 4, column 6: '.' (possible bomb)\n\n- Diagonally below left: row 6, column 4: '_'\n\n- Diagonally below right: row 6, column 6: '2'\n\nThe '1' in row 5, column 5 should have exactly one adjacent bomb. Looking at the possible bomb locations, if row 4, column 6 has a bomb, then that would be the only bomb adjacent to row 5, column 5, since all others are either numbers or empty spaces. So, row 4, column 6 must contain a bomb.\n\nNow, looking at row 3, column 2, which is a '1'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- Above: row 2, column 2: '.'\n\n- Left: row 3, column 1: '.'\n\n- Right: row 3, column 3: '1'\n\n- Below: row 4, column 2: '1'\n\n- Diagonally above left: row 2, column 1: '.'\n\n- Diagonally above right: row 2, column 3: '.'\n\n- Diagonally below left: row 4, column 1: '.'\n\n- Diagonally below right: row 4, column 3: '1'\n\nSince it's a '1', exactly one of these adjacent cells contains a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, row 3, column 3 is also a '1', so exactly one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nRow 4, column 2 is a '1', so one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nRow 4, column 3 is a '1', so one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nRow 4, column 4 is a '1', so one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nThis area seems a bit tricky because there are overlapping possible bomb locations.\n\nLet me try to find a cell that I can safely reveal or flag based on the current information.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 5, which is a '2'. It has two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- Above: row 5, column 5: '1'\n\n- Left: row 6, column 4: '_'\n\n- Right: row 6, column 6: '2'\n\n- Below: row 7, column 5: '1'\n\n- Diagonally above left: row 5, column 4: '_'\n\n- Diagonally above right: row 5, column 6: '1'\n\n- Diagonally below left: row 7, column 4: '1'\n\n- Diagonally below right: row 7, column 6: '.'\n\nThe '2' needs two adjacent bombs. Let's see which of these could be bombs.\n\nRow 5, column 5 is a '1', which has only one adjacent bomb.\n\nRow 5, column 4 is '_', no bomb.\n\nRow 5, column 6 is '1', one adjacent bomb.\n\nRow 6, column 4 is '_', no bomb.\n\nRow 6, column 6 is '2', needs two adjacent bombs.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is '1', one adjacent bomb.\n\nRow 7, column 4 is '1', one adjacent bomb.\n\nRow 7, column 6 is '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, for row 6, column 5's '2', the possible bomb locations are row 7, column 6 ('.') and maybe others.\n\nBut it's not clear yet. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at row 7, column 2, which is a '1'.\n\nWait, row 7, column 2 is '_', which is empty, so no number there. Wait, let's check again.\n\nRow 7, column 2 is '_', yes, empty. So, no number there.\n\nWait, row 3, column 2 is a '1', row 4, column 2 is a '1', and so on.\n\nMaybe I should consider the group of '1's in the middle.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to find a cell that is definitely safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 2, which is a '.', and row 8, column 3 is a '.', and row 9, column 2 is a '.', and row 9, column 3 is a '.'.\n\nThese cells are adjacent to some numbers, let's see.\n\nRow 8, column 2 is adjacent to:\n\n- Above: row 7, column 2: '_'\n\n- Left: row 8, column 1: '_'\n\n- Right: row 8, column 3: '.'\n\n- Below: row 9, column 2: '.'\n\n- Diagonally above left: row 7, column 1: '_'\n\n- Diagonally above right: row 7, column 3: '1'\n\n- Diagonally below left: row 9, column 1: '_'\n\n- Diagonally below right: row 9, column 3: '.'\n\nRow 8, column 2 is adjacent to row 7, column 3, which is a '1'. So, if I flag row 7, column 3 as a bomb, but it's already a number, so no bomb there.\n\nWait, row 7, column 3 is a '1', so it has one adjacent bomb.\n\nSo, for row 7, column 3's '1', its adjacent cells are:\n\n- Above: row 6, column 3: '_'\n\n- Left: row 7, column 2: '_'\n\n- Right: row 7, column 4: '1'\n\n- Below: row 8, column 3: '.'\n\n- Diagonally above left: row 6, column 2: '_'\n\n- Diagonally above right: row 6, column 4: '_'\n\n- Diagonally below left: row 8, column 2: '.'\n\n- Diagonally below right: row 8, column 4: '.'\n\nSo, the possible bomb locations for row 7, column 3's '1' are row 8, column 2 and row 8, column 4.\n\nBut row 8, column 4 is adjacent to row 7, column 4, which is a '1', so if row 8, column 4 is a bomb, then row 7, column 4's '1' would have that bomb adjacent to it.\n\nWait, row 7, column 4 is a '1', its adjacent cells are:\n\n- Above: row 6, column 4: '_'\n\n- Left: row 7, column 3: '1'\n\n- Right: row 7, column 5: '1'\n\n- Below: row 8, column 4: '.'\n\n- Diagonally above left: row 6, column 3: '_'\n\n- Diagonally above right: row 6, column 5: '_'\n\n- Diagonally below left: row 8, column 3: '.'\n\n- Diagonally below right: row 8, column 5: '.'\n\nSo, for row 7, column 4's '1', the possible bomb locations are row 8, column 4 and row 8, column 5.\n\nBut row 8, column 5 is adjacent to row 7, column 5, which is a '1'.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is a '1', its adjacent cells are:\n\n- Above: row 6, column 5: '_'\n\n- Left: row 7, column 4: '1'\n\n- Right: row 7, column 6: '.'\n\n- Below: row 8, column 5: '.'\n\n- Diagonally above left: row 6, column 4: '_'\n\n- Diagonally above right: row 6, column 6: '2'\n\n- Diagonally below left: row 8, column 4: '.'\n\n- Diagonally below right: row 8, column 6: '.'\n\nSo, for row 7, column 5's '1', the possible bomb locations are row 8, column 5 and row 8, column 6.\n\nBut row 8, column 6 is adjacent to row 7, column 6, which is a '.', unexplored.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for a cell that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0, which is a '.', and it's adjacent to other '.'s and unexplored cells.\n\nBut I need to be careful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to flag some cells based on the '3' in row 4, column 5.\n\nWe earlier deduced that row 4, column 6; row 3, column 4; and row 3, column 6 are possible bomb locations for the '3'.\n\nBut we also have the '1' in row 5, column 5, which can only have one adjacent bomb.\n\nIf row 4, column 6 is a bomb, then row 5, column 5 only has one adjacent bomb, which is okay.\n\nBut if row 3, column 4 or row 3, column 6 is a bomb, then row 5, column 5 would have more than one adjacent bomb, which contradicts the '1'.\n\nWait, no, row 5, column 5's adjacent cells don't include row 3, column 4 or row 3, column 6.\n\nWait, row 5, column 5's adjacent cells are:\n\n- row 4, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 5, column 4: '_'\n\n- row 5, column 6: '1'\n\n- row 6, column 5: '_'\n\n- row 4, column 4: '1'\n\n- row 4, column 6: '.'\n\n- row 6, column 4: '_'\n\n- row 6, column 6: '2'\n\nSo, only row 4, column 6 is a possible bomb location adjacent to row 5, column 5.\n\nTherefore, row 4, column 6 must be a bomb, and the other two, row 3, column 4 and row 3, column 6, cannot be bombs.\n\nWait, but the '3' in row 4, column 5 needs three adjacent bombs, and if row 4, column 6 is a bomb, and the other two are not, that only accounts for one bomb.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the '3' in row 4, column 5 has adjacent cells:\n\n- row 3, column 5: '_'\n\n- row 4, column 4: '1'\n\n- row 4, column 6: '.'\n\n- row 5, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 3, column 4: '.'\n\n- row 3, column 6: '.'\n\n- row 5, column 4: '_'\n\n- row 5, column 6: '1'\n\nSo, out of these, row 4, column 6; row 3, column 4; and row 3, column 6 are unexplored.\n\nIf row 4, column 6 is a bomb, and row 3, column 4 and row 3, column 6 are not bombs, then the '3' would only have one adjacent bomb, which doesn't match the '3'.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, if row 4, column 6 is a bomb, and row 3, column 4 and row 3, column 6 are also bombs, then the '3' would have three adjacent bombs, which matches.\n\nBut then row 5, column 5's '1' would have only one adjacent bomb, which is row 4, column 6, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, row 5, column 4's '_' would not have a bomb, and row 5, column 6's '1' would have row 4, column 6 as its adjacent bomb.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I should flag row 4, column 6; row 3, column 4; and row 3, column 6 as bombs.\n\nBut wait, I only have 10 flags left, and there are 10 bombs in total.\n\nIf I flag these three cells, I'll have 7 flags left.\n\nBut I need to make sure that these are indeed bombs.\n\nLooking back, if I flag row 4, column 6; row 3, column 4; and row 3, column 6, then the '3' in row 4, column 5 is satisfied, and the '1's around them are also satisfied.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nNow, with these flags in place, I can safely reveal other cells.\n\nFor example, row 3, column 5 is a '_', which is already revealed, so no bomb there.\n\nRow 4, column 4 is a '1', which is already accounted for with one adjacent flag (row 4, column 6).\n\nSimilarly, row 5, column 5 is a '1', which has one adjacent flag (row 4, column 6).\n\nSo, I think it's safe to reveal row 3, column 7, which is a '.'.\n\nWait, row 3, column 7 is '.', but I need to check its adjacent cells.\n\nRow 3, column 7 is adjacent to:\n\n- row 2, column 7: '.'\n\n- row 3, column 6: '.' (flagged)\n\n- row 3, column 8: '.'\n\n- row 4, column 7: '.'\n\n- row 2, column 6: '.'\n\n- row 2, column 8: '.'\n\n- row 4, column 6: '.' (flagged)\n\n- row 4, column 8: '.'\n\nGiven that row 3, column 6 and row 4, column 6 are flagged as bombs, and assuming that's correct, then row 3, column 7 should be safe to reveal.\n\nBut perhaps I should look for a different cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should flag more cells based on the '2' in row 6, column 5.\n\nRow 6, column 5 is a '2', needing two adjacent bombs.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- row 5, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 6, column 4: '_'\n\n- row 6, column 6: '2'\n\n- row 7, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 5, column 4: '_'\n\n- row 5, column 6: '1'\n\n- row 7, column 4: '1'\n\n- row 7, column 6: '.'\n\nSo, possible bomb locations are row 7, column 6 ('.') and maybe others.\n\nBut I already have some flags placed, so I need to see if those satisfy the '2'.\n\nWait, I haven't placed any flags there yet.\n\nGiven that row 5, column 5 is a '1' with one adjacent flag (row 4, column 6), and row 6, column 5 is a '2', which needs two adjacent bombs.\n\nIf row 7, column 6 is a bomb, that would satisfy one of the '2's requirements.\n\nBut I need another bomb adjacent to row 6, column 5.\n\nRow 6, column 4 is '_', no bomb.\n\nRow 6, column 6 is '2', no bomb there.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is '1', no bomb there.\n\nRow 5, column 4 is '_', no bomb.\n\nRow 5, column 6 is '1', no bomb.\n\nSo, only row 7, column 6 is a possible bomb location.\n\nBut that's only one bomb, and the '2' needs two bombs adjacent.\n\nWait, perhaps there are other cells I'm missing.\n\nWait, row 6, column 5 is adjacent to row 7, column 6 ('.') and row 5, column 6 ('1').\n\nBut row 5, column 6 is a '1', which can't have a bomb there.\n\nSo, perhaps row 5, column 6 has a bomb adjacent to it, but it's already accounted for by row 4, column 6.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing.\n\nMaybe I should try to reveal a cell that seems safe based on the current flags.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4, which is a '.', adjacent to row 1, column 4: '.', row 2, column 3: '.', row 2, column 5: '.', row 3, column 4: '1', row 3, column 5: '_', row 1, column 5: '.', row 3, column 3: '1', row 1, column 3: '.'.\n\nGiven that row 3, column 4 is flagged as a bomb, and row 4, column 6 is flagged as a bomb, I think row 2, column 4 should be safe to reveal.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check the adjacent cells:\n\n- row 1, column 4: '.' (no bomb)\n\n- row 2, column 3: '.' (no bomb)\n\n- row 2, column 5: '.' (no bomb)\n\n- row 3, column 4: '1' (flagged as bomb)\n\n- row 3, column 5: '_' (no bomb)\n\n- row 1, column 5: '.' (no bomb)\n\n- row 3, column 3: '1' (no bomb)\n\n- row 1, column 3: '.' (no bomb)\n\nSo, only row 3, column 4 is a bomb adjacent to it, which is already flagged.\n\nTherefore, row 2, column 4 should be safe to reveal.\n\nI'll go with that.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the current flags and revealed numbers, row 2, column 4 appears to be a safe cell to reveal, as all potential bomb adjacencies are already accounted for.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . 1 1 . . . . . .\n4 . . 1 1 1 3 . . . .\n5 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . . .\n7 _ 1 1 1 1 . . . . .\n8 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n9 _ 1 . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 5, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left to find. I've got 10 flags remaining, which matches the number of bombs left. That means I need to place exactly 10 flags on bombs without hitting any of them.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the numbers and see where the bombs could be. Let's start from the top left corner and see what's revealed.\n\nLooking at row 0 and row 1, they're mostly empty except for the last two columns. Row 0 has a '1' at position (0,7), and row 1 has a '1' at position (1,7). Then row 2 has some numbers: '_', '_', '_', '1', '1', '2', '1', '1', '.', '.'.\n\nWait, let's map out what's visible:\n\nRow 0: _, _, _, _, _, _, _, 1, ., .\n\nRow 1: _, _, _, _, _, _, _, 1, ., .\n\nRow 2: _, _, _, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, ., .\n\nRow 3: 1, 1, 1, 1, ., 3, ., ., ., .\n\nRow 4: ., ., 1, 1, 1, 3, ., ., ., .\n\nRow 5: 1, 1, 1, _, _, 1, ., ., ., .\n\nRow 6: _, _, _, _, _, 1, 2, ., ., .\n\nRow 7: _, 1, 1, 1, 1, ., ., ., ., .\n\nRow 8: _, 1, ., ., ., ., ., ., ., .\n\nRow 9: _, 1, ., ., ., ., ., ., ., .\n\nOkay, so let's focus on areas where I can deduce the positions of the bombs.\n\nStarting with row 0 and row 1, positions (0,7) and (1,7) both show '1'. That means each of these has exactly one bomb in their adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at position (0,7):\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (0,8)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (1,8)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (2,8)\n\nBut positions (0,8) and (1,8) are unexplored ('.'), and positions (1,7) is a '1', which is already considered.\n\nSimilarly, position (1,7) has adjacent cells:\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (0,7)\n\n- (0,8)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (1,8)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (2,8)\n\nBut again, (0,7) and (1,7) are numbers, so the bombs must be in the unexplored cells.\n\nWait, but both (0,7) and (1,7) show '1', meaning each has exactly one bomb in their adjacent cells.\n\nLet me try to see if there's an overlap in their adjacent cells.\n\nCommon adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (0,8)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,8)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (2,8)\n\nBut positions (2,7) is a '1', which is already a number, so it's safe.\n\nWait, position (2,7) is a '1', which means it has one adjacent bomb.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at another area.\n\nLet's look at row 2, column 3 to column 8.\n\nRow 2: _, _, _, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, ., .\n\nSo, positions (2,3) to (2,7) are '1','1','2','1','1', and then (2,8) and (2,9) are unexplored.\n\nLet's see what these numbers tell me.\n\nStarting with position (2,3), which is '1'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\nBut (1,3) is '_', (1,4) is '_', (2,2) is '_', (2,3) is '1', (2,4) is '1', (3,3) is '1', (3,4) is '1', but I need to see which of these are unexplored or have flags.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the board:\n\nRow 1: positions (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) are all '_', which means they're empty revealed spaces, so no bombs there.\n\nRow 2: positions (2,2) is '_', (2,3) is '1', (2,4) is '1'.\n\nRow 3: positions (3,2) is '1', (3,3) is '1', (3,4) is '1'.\n\nSo, for position (2,3) '1', its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,2): safe\n\n- (1,3): safe\n\n- (1,4): safe\n\n- (2,2): safe\n\n- (2,3): number '1'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\nWait, but none of these are flagged or bombs, so does that mean there are no bombs adjacent to (2,3)? But it's showing '1', so there must be one bomb in these adjacent cells.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let's check again.\n\nWait, position (2,3) is '1', and its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,2): '_'\n\n- (1,3): '_'\n\n- (1,4): '_'\n\n- (2,2): '_'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\nAll of these are either '_' or '1', which means no bombs are in these positions. Wait, but position (2,3) is '1', which means there is one bomb in its adjacent cells. But all adjacent cells are either safe or numbered, so where is the bomb?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Maybe I need to look further.\n\nLet me look at position (2,4), which is also '1'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,5)\n\nAgain, most of these are '_', '1', or '2', which are safe or numbered, but position (2,5) is '2'.\n\nSimilarly, position (2,5) is '2', meaning there are two bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (3,6)\n\nAgain, most of these are safe or numbered, but position (3,5) is '.', which is unexplored.\n\nWait, maybe I can focus on position (2,5) '2' and see if I can deduce where the two bombs are.\n\nAdjacent to (2,5):\n\n- (1,4): '_'\n\n- (1,5): '_'\n\n- (1,6): '_'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '2'\n\n- (2,6): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\n- (3,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (3,6): '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, the only unexplored adjacent cells are (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nSince position (2,5) is '2', there must be exactly two bombs in these two unexplored cells. Therefore, both (3,5) and (3,6) must be bombs.\n\nSo, I can place flags on (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nBut wait, I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs to find. If I place flags on (3,5) and (3,6), that would be 2 flags placed, leaving me with 8 flags and 8 bombs to find.\n\nBut before doing that, I need to make sure that there are no conflicts with other numbers.\n\nLet's check position (3,4), which is '1'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\nNow, position (3,4) is '1', meaning there is one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '2'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\n- (3,5): '.' (potential bomb)\n\n- (4,3): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (4,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (4,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\nWait, but we already deduced that (3,5) is a bomb based on position (2,5) '2'.\n\nSo, if (3,5) is a bomb, then for position (3,4) '1', it already has one bomb adjacent, which is (3,5). Therefore, none of the other adjacent cells can be bombs.\n\nSo, (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) are safe to reveal.\n\nBut wait, position (3,6) is also a bomb, as deduced from position (2,5) '2'.\n\nBut position (3,4) only accounts for one bomb, which is (3,5). So, (3,6) being a bomb doesn't affect position (3,4)'s count.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5).\n\nBut let's see what's at position (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5).\n\nLooking back at the board, row 4:\n\nRow 4: ., ., 1, 1, 1, 3, ., ., ., .\n\nSo, positions (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) are all '.', which are unexplored.\n\nSince position (3,4) '1' already has one adjacent bomb at (3,5), the others should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5).\n\nBut let's choose one to reveal first. Maybe start with (4,3).\n\nBut before doing that, let's see if there's a better move elsewhere.\n\nLooking at position (2,6), which is '1'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (3,7)\n\nNow, (1,5): '_'\n\n(1,6): '_'\n\n(1,7): '1'\n\n(2,5): '2'\n\n(2,6): '1'\n\n(2,7): '1'\n\n(3,5): '.' (potential bomb)\n\n(3,6): '.' (potential bomb)\n\n(3,7): '.' (unexplored)\n\nPosition (2,6) is '1', meaning one bomb adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (1,5): safe\n\n- (1,6): safe\n\n- (1,7): number '1'\n\n- (2,5): '2'\n\n- (2,6): '1'\n\n- (2,7): '1'\n\n- (3,5): potential bomb\n\n- (3,6): potential bomb\n\n- (3,7): unexplored\n\nWe already deduced that (3,5) and (3,6) are bombs based on position (2,5) '2'.\n\nTherefore, position (2,6) '1' already has one bomb adjacent, which is (3,6).\n\nTherefore, none of the other adjacent cells can be bombs.\n\nSo, (3,7) is safe to reveal.\n\nBut position (3,7) is '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, I can reveal (3,7).\n\nSimilarly, position (2,7) is '1'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (1,8)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (2,8)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (3,8)\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (1,6): '_'\n\n- (1,7): '1'\n\n- (1,8): '.'\n\n- (2,6): '1'\n\n- (2,7): '1'\n\n- (2,8): '.'\n\n- (3,6): potential bomb\n\n- (3,7): about to be revealed\n\n- (3,8): '.'\n\nPosition (2,7) is '1', meaning one bomb adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (1,6): safe\n\n- (1,7): '1'\n\n- (1,8): unexplored\n\n- (2,6): '1'\n\n- (2,7): '1'\n\n- (2,8): unexplored\n\n- (3,6): potential bomb\n\n- (3,7): about to be revealed\n\n- (3,8): unexplored\n\nAssuming (3,6) is a bomb, which we deduced from position (2,5) '2', then position (2,7) '1' already has one bomb adjacent, which is (3,6).\n\nTherefore, none of the other adjacent cells can be bombs.\n\nSo, (1,8), (2,8), and (3,8) are safe to reveal.\n\nBut before revealing them, let's see if there's more information to deduce.\n\nLooking at position (3,3), which is '1'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,4)\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (2,2): '_'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\n- (4,2): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (4,3): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (4,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\nPosition (3,3) is '1', meaning one bomb adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells are all either safe or numbered, except for (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4), which are unexplored.\n\nBut earlier, from position (3,4) '1', we deduced that (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) are safe, but that was based on (3,4)'s count already satisfied by (3,5) being a bomb.\n\nWait, but position (3,3) '1' needs one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nAdjacent cells are:\n\n- (2,2): safe\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\n- (4,2): '.'\n\n- (4,3): '.'\n\n- (4,4): '.'\n\nSo, if none of the adjacent cells are flagged as bombs, but position (3,3) is '1', there must be a bomb in one of these unexplored cells: (4,2), (4,3), or (4,4).\n\nBut earlier, from position (3,4) '1', we thought that (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) are safe, but that was based on (3,4)'s count being satisfied by (3,5) being a bomb.\n\nWait, maybe there's a conflict here.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nPosition (3,4) '1' has adjacent cells:\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '2'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\n- (3,5): '.' (bomb)\n\n- (4,3): '.' (safe?)\n\n- (4,4): '.' (safe?)\n\n- (4,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\nFrom position (3,4) '1', with (3,5) being a bomb, the '1' is satisfied, so (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) should be safe.\n\nBut position (3,3) '1' requires one bomb in its adjacent cells, which are (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4). But if (4,3) and (4,4) are safe, then (4,2) must be a bomb.\n\nWait, but position (4,2) is adjacent to position (4,3), which is safe.\n\nLooking at position (4,3), which is '.', and we thought it was safe based on position (3,4) '1' being satisfied.\n\nBut if position (3,3) '1' requires a bomb in its adjacent cells, and (4,3) and (4,4) are safe, then (4,2) must be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, I should place a flag on (4,2).\n\nSo, now I have:\n\n- (3,5) is a bomb\n\n- (3,6) is a bomb\n\n- (4,2) is a bomb\n\nThat's three bombs flagged.\n\nBut I have 10 flags remaining, and 10 bombs in total, so I've flagged 3 so far.\n\nWait, but actually, I haven't placed any flags yet; I was just deducing where they should be.\n\nSo, I need to place flags on (3,5), (3,6), and (4,2).\n\nBut let's confirm again.\n\nFrom position (2,5) '2', adjacent unexplored cells are (3,5) and (3,6), so both must be bombs.\n\nFrom position (3,3) '1', adjacent unexplored cells are (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4). Since (3,5) is already a bomb, but (4,2) must be a bomb to satisfy position (3,3)'s '1'.\n\nWait, but position (3,4) '1' has (3,5) as a bomb, so its count is satisfied, making (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) safe.\n\nTherefore, position (3,3) '1' must have its bomb in (4,2), because (4,3) and (4,4) are safe.\n\nTherefore, (4,2) must be a bomb.\n\nSo, I should place flags on (3,5), (3,6), and (4,2).\n\nBut before doing that, let's see if there's more information.\n\nLooking at position (4,3), which is '.', and we think it's safe, let's see what's around it.\n\nPosition (4,3) is adjacent to:\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\n- (4,2): '.' (potential bomb)\n\n- (4,3): '.'\n\n- (4,4): '.'\n\n- (5,2): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (5,3): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (5,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\nBut position (3,3) '1' requires one bomb adjacent, which is (4,2), as we deduced.\n\nTherefore, (4,3) and (4,4) are safe.\n\nSimilarly, position (4,4) is adjacent to:\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\n- (3,5): '.' (bomb)\n\n- (4,3): '.'\n\n- (4,4): '.'\n\n- (4,5): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '.'\n\n- (5,4): '.'\n\n- (5,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\nPosition (4,4) should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (4,3) and (4,4).\n\nBut before doing that, let's see if there's a better move.\n\nLooking at position (5,2), which is '.', adjacent to:\n\n- (4,1): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (4,2): '.' (potential bomb)\n\n- (4,3): '.'\n\n- (5,1): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (5,2): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '.'\n\n- (6,1): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (6,2): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (6,3): '.' (unexplored)\n\nThis area seems unclear, with many unexplored cells.\n\nBetter to stick with areas where I have more information.\n\nLooking back, position (6,5) is '1', adjacent to:\n\n- (5,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (5,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (5,6): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (6,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (6,5): '1'\n\n- (6,6): '2'\n\n- (7,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (7,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (7,6): '.' (unexplored)\n\nThis seems too vague to make a deduction.\n\nWait, position (6,5) is '1', and position (6,6) is '2', with adjacent unexplored cells.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to deduce where the bombs are.\n\nBetter to focus on the top part where I already have some flags placed.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- (3,5) is a bomb\n\n- (3,6) is a bomb\n\n- (4,2) is a bomb\n\nI should place flags on these positions.\n\nBut before placing flags, I need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nLooking at position (4,5), which is '.', adjacent to:\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\n- (3,5): '.' (bomb)\n\n- (3,6): '.' (bomb)\n\n- (4,4): '.'\n\n- (4,5): '.'\n\n- (4,6): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (5,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (5,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (5,6): '.' (unexplored)\n\nPosition (3,5) is a bomb, which affects position (4,5).\n\nBut position (4,5) is unexplored, and its adjacent bombs are (3,5) and possibly (3,6).\n\nWait, (3,6) is also a bomb, which is adjacent to position (4,5).\n\nSo, position (4,5) would have two adjacent bombs.\n\nIf I reveal (4,5), it would show a '2', assuming no other bombs are adjacent.\n\nBut since I don't know yet, better to place flags first on (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, position (4,2) is a bomb, adjacent to:\n\n- (3,1): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (4,1): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (4,2): '.' (bomb)\n\n- (4,3): '.'\n\n- (5,1): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (5,2): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (5,3): '.' (unexplored)\n\nPosition (3,2) '1' requires one adjacent bomb, which is (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, position (3,3) '1' requires one adjacent bomb, which is (4,2).\n\nSo, (4,2) satisfies both positions (3,2) and (3,3)'s '1' counts.\n\nTherefore, I can safely place flags on (3,5), (3,6), and (4,2).\n\nBut I have to do this step by step, placing one flag at a time.\n\nGiven that, my first move should be to place a flag on (3,5).\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nRow 3, column 5: that's position (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, row 3, column 6: (3,6).\n\nRow 4, column 2: (4,2).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, my first move is to place a flag on (3,5).\n\nBut before that, let's see if there's a safer cell to reveal first.\n\nLooking back, position (4,3) should be safe, as we deduced earlier.\n\nTherefore, maybe I should reveal (4,3) first.\n\nBut to be cautious, I'll place a flag on (3,5) first.\n\nTherefore, my move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag on position (3,5) as deduced from position (2,5) '2'.\n\nMOVE: 3,5,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1 . .\n3 1 1 1 1 . 3 . . . .\n4 . . 1 1 1 3 . . . .\n5 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . . .\n7 _ 1 1 1 1 . . . . .\n8 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n9 _ 1 . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board and trying to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means I've already placed one flag somewhere on the board.\n\nLooking at the board, I see some revealed numbers and some flagged spaces. I need to use these clues to determine where the bombs are and where it's safe to click.\n\nLet me start by examining the areas where I have some information.\n\nIn row 2, column 3, there's a '1'. Looking around it, there are other numbers and some flagged spaces. I need to see how these interact.\n\nWait, in row 3, column 3, there's a '1', and next to it is a flagged space at (3,5). There's also a '1' at (3,6), which is currently empty.\n\nHmm, let's see. The '1' at (3,3) has flagged space at (3,5). Are there other possible bomb locations around it?\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 4, column 2, which has a '1'. Around it, there's a '1' at (4,0), which is empty, and a '1' at (4,1), which is also empty.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for areas where I can deduce more clearly.\n\nLet me look at row 5, column 0, which has a '1'. Around it, there's another '1' at (5,1), and a '1' at (5,2). There's also a '1' at (5,5).\n\nThis seems like a cluster of '1's. Maybe I can find a pattern here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for areas where the number of adjacent flags equals the number on the tile. That would mean the remaining adjacent tiles are safe to click.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of adjacent flags is less than the number on the tile, then the remaining adjacent tiles must contain bombs, so I should flag them.\n\nLet me try to find such a situation.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5, which has a '3'. Around it, there's a '1' at (4,4), a '1' at (4,6), and a flagged space at (3,5).\n\nWait, (3,5) is flagged, which is one of the adjacent tiles to (4,5).\n\nSo, for (4,5), which is '3', it needs three adjacent bombs. Currently, one is flagged at (3,5). So, there must be two more bombs around it.\n\nThe possible locations for these bombs are: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nBut (5,5) is empty, and (4,5) is '3'. Wait, (4,5) is '3', which is already accounted for.\n\nWait, I need to be careful here. (4,5) is '3', and it's surrounded by these tiles:\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,5) [flagged]\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,6)\n\nOut of these, (3,5) is flagged, so that's one bomb. So, there need to be two more bombs among the remaining adjacent tiles.\n\nNow, looking at these tiles:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): empty\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): empty\n\n- (5,6): empty\n\nWait, actually, (5,5) is a '1', according to the board. Wait, no, in row 6, column 5 is '2', and row 5, column 5 is empty.\n\nWait, I need to check the board again carefully.\n\nRow 4, column 5 is '3'. Adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,5): flagged\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): empty\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): '2'\n\nOkay, so (5,5) is '1', and (5,6) is '2'.\n\nSo, for (4,5), which is '3', with one flagged adjacent tile, there must be two more bombs among: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nBut (5,5) is '1', which means it has one adjacent bomb, which is already flagged at (3,5). So, the other adjacent tiles to (5,5) should not contain bombs.\n\nWait, no. (5,5) is '1', and it's adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', and (3,5), which is flagged. So, for (5,5), which is '1', and it's adjacent to one flagged bomb at (3,5), that satisfies its count. So, the other adjacent tiles to (5,5) should not contain bombs.\n\nThe adjacent tiles to (5,5) are:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nBut some of these are out of bounds or already revealed.\n\nWait, no. The board is 10x10, so all these coordinates are valid.\n\nBut, (4,5) is '3', which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (5,5) is '1', which is a number, not a bomb. (3,5) is flagged, which is a bomb.\n\nSo, for (5,5), which is '1', and it's adjacent to one bomb at (3,5), that satisfies its count. Therefore, the other adjacent tiles should not contain bombs.\n\nSo, (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) should all be safe.\n\nWait, but (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6) are still unrevealed, so I can consider revealing them.\n\nBut, before doing that, I need to make sure that there are no conflicts with other numbers.\n\nLet me check (5,5), which is '1', and it's adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', and (3,5), which is flagged.\n\nSo, for (4,5), which is '3', it needs three adjacent bombs. One is at (3,5), so two more are needed among: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nNow, (5,5) is '1', and it's satisfied, so (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is '2', which is adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', (4,6), (5,5), which is '1', (5,7), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nWait, but (5,6) is '2', and it's adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', and (5,5), which is '1', and (6,5), which is empty.\n\nBut, I need to see how many flags are adjacent to (5,6).\n\nWait, (5,6) is '2', and adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (4,5): '3'\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,7): empty\n\n- (6,5): empty\n\n- (6,6): empty\n\n- (7,5): empty\n\n- (7,6): empty\n\nSo, for (5,6), which is '2', and none of its adjacent tiles are flagged, it means that two of these adjacent tiles must be bombs.\n\nBut, I already have (4,5) is '3', which needs two more bombs, and (5,6) needs two bombs in its adjacent tiles.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. Maybe I should look at another area.\n\nLet me look at row 2, column 3, which is '1'. Adjacent to it are:\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nLooking at these, some are revealed, some are not.\n\nWait, row 2, column 3 is '1', and it's adjacent to (1,2), which is empty, (1,3), which is empty, (1,4), which is empty, (2,2), which is empty, (2,4), which is '1', (3,2), which is '1', (3,3), which is '1', (3,4), which is empty.\n\nSo, for (2,3), which is '1', and none of its adjacent tiles are flagged, it means that one of these adjacent tiles is a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is '1', and its adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nAmong these, (2,3) is '1', and (3,5) is flagged.\n\nWait, (3,5) is flagged, which is adjacent to (2,4), which is '1'. So, for (2,4), which is '1', and it has one flagged adjacent tile, that means there are no more bombs adjacent to it.\n\nTherefore, the other adjacent tiles to (2,4) should be safe to click.\n\nSo, (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4) should be safe.\n\nWait, but some of these are already revealed or flagged.\n\nWait, (2,4) is '1', and its adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (1,3): empty\n\n- (1,4): empty\n\n- (1,5): empty\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,5): empty\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,5): flagged\n\nSo, since (2,4) has one flagged adjacent tile, which is (3,5), that satisfies its '1' count. Therefore, the other adjacent tiles should be safe.\n\nSo, I can consider revealing (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,4).\n\nBut, before doing that, I need to check if any of these tiles are part of another number's adjacent tiles.\n\nFor example, (1,4) is adjacent to (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nBut, I need to see what's revealed there.\n\nWait, row 0 is all empty or '1's, and row 1 is empty or '1's.\n\nIt's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother strategy is to look for tiles that are adjacent to multiple numbers, and see what constraints that imposes.\n\nFor example, consider tile (4,4), which is adjacent to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nBut many of these are revealed or flagged.\n\nWait, (4,4) is adjacent to:\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,5): flagged\n\n- (4,3): empty\n\n- (4,5): '3'\n\n- (5,3): empty\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\nSo, (4,4) is adjacent to two numbers: (3,3) '1' and (4,5) '3', and one flagged tile at (3,5).\n\nI need to see how this information can help me determine if (4,4) is a bomb or safe.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is adjacent to (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7).\n\nBut many of these are revealed or flagged.\n\nWait, (4,6) is adjacent to:\n\n- (3,5): flagged\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (3,7): empty\n\n- (4,5): '3'\n\n- (4,7): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): '2'\n\n- (5,7): empty\n\nSo, (4,6) is adjacent to (3,5) flagged, (4,5) '3', (5,5) '1', and (5,6) '2'.\n\nThis seems complex.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability or look for areas with fewer possibilities.\n\nLooking back at row 5, column 5, which is '1', and its adjacent tiles are mostly empty or numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at row 6, column 5, which is '2'. Adjacent to it are:\n\n- (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): '2'\n\n- (6,4): empty\n\n- (6,5): empty\n\n- (6,6): empty\n\n- (7,4): empty\n\n- (7,5): empty\n\n- (7,6): empty\n\nSo, for (6,5), which is '2', and none of its adjacent tiles are flagged, it means that two of its adjacent tiles contain bombs.\n\nBut, (5,5) is '1', which is satisfied, and (5,6) is '2', which needs two adjacent bombs.\n\nThis seems interconnected.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at (5,6), which is '2', and see which tiles around it could contain bombs.\n\nAdjacent to (5,6):\n\n- (4,5): '3'\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,7): empty\n\n- (6,5): empty\n\n- (6,6): empty\n\n- (7,5): empty\n\n- (7,6): empty\n\nSo, for (5,6), which is '2', and it has one flagged adjacent tile at (3,5), but (3,5) is not adjacent to (5,6). Wait, (3,5) is flagged, but it's not adjacent to (5,6). So, no flags adjacent to (5,6).\n\nTherefore, two of the adjacent tiles to (5,6) must be bombs.\n\nThe adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (4,5): '3'\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,7): empty\n\n- (6,5): empty\n\n- (6,6): empty\n\n- (7,5): empty\n\n- (7,6): empty\n\nNow, (4,5) is '3', which needs two more bombs adjacent to it, besides the one at (3,5).\n\nSo, the possible bomb locations for (4,5) are: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is adjacent to (4,5), and it's a number, so it can't be a bomb.\n\nWait, no, (5,6) is '2', which is a number, not a bomb.\n\nSo, for (4,5), which is '3', and it's adjacent to (3,4), (3,5) [flagged], (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nOut of these, (3,5) is flagged, and (5,5) is '1', which is not a bomb.\n\nSo, the possible bomb locations for (4,5) are: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4).\n\nBut, (5,6) needs two adjacent bombs, which could be among: (4,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,5), (7,6).\n\nWait, but (5,5) is '1', which is satisfied, so no more bombs adjacent to it.\n\nTherefore, for (5,6), which is '2', the possible bomb locations are: (4,6), (6,5), (6,6), (7,5), (7,6).\n\nBut, (4,6) is adjacent to both (4,5) and (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is adjacent to both (5,5) and (6,5).\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a tile that, if revealed, would give me more information without risking a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 4, which is empty. It's adjacent to (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5).\n\nBut many of these are empty or numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I can try to reveal (5,4), since it's adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', and (5,5), which is '1'.\n\nBut, considering that (4,5) needs two more bombs, and (5,5) is satisfied, maybe (5,4) is safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place a flag on (4,4), assuming it's a bomb, and see if that satisfies the conditions.\n\nIf I flag (4,4), then for (4,5), which is '3', it would have two bombs adjacent: (3,5) and (4,4). But it needs three bombs, so that wouldn't be enough.\n\nWait, (4,5) is '3', and it's adjacent to (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nIf I flag (4,4), then it would have (3,5), (4,4), and possibly another one.\n\nBut it's getting too speculative.\n\nMaybe I should consider that (4,4) is safe and see what that implies.\n\nIf (4,4) is safe, then for (4,5), which is '3', it needs three bombs adjacent: (3,5), and two more among (3,4), (3,6), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) needs two bombs adjacent: possibly (4,6), (6,5), (6,6), (7,5), (7,6).\n\nThis is too many variables.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a different area of the board where the relationships are clearer.\n\nLet me look at row 8, column 1, which is '1'. Adjacent to it are:\n\n- (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\nLooking at these tiles:\n\n- (7,0): empty\n\n- (7,1): '1'\n\n- (7,2): '1'\n\n- (8,0): empty\n\n- (8,2): empty\n\n- (9,0): empty\n\n- (9,1): '1'\n\n- (9,2): empty\n\nSo, for (8,1), which is '1', and none of its adjacent tiles are flagged, it means that one of these adjacent tiles is a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (7,1) is '1', and (9,1) is '1', both with no adjacent flags.\n\nThis seems like another cluster, but it's in a different part of the board.\n\nMaybe I can try to reveal (8,2), assuming it's safe.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to step on a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that (8,2) is a bomb and place a flag there.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to be sure.\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Maybe I should consider the probability and choose a tile with the lowest risk.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that in row 5, column 4, which is empty, and it's adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', and (5,5), which is '1'.\n\nGiven that (5,5) is satisfied, and (4,5) needs two more bombs, perhaps (5,4) is safe.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reveal (6,5), which is adjacent to (5,5), which is '1' and satisfied, and (6,5) is empty.\n\nIf I reveal (6,5), and it's a number, it might give me more information.\n\nBut there's a risk it could be a bomb.\n\nWait, but (5,5) is '1', and it's satisfied, so (6,5) should be safe.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing (6,5).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the analysis, (5,5) is '1' and satisfied with the flagged bomb at (3,5). Therefore, adjacent tiles to (5,5) should be safe, including (6,5).\n\n**MOVE:** 6,5,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1 . .\n3 1 1 1 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board and trying to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means I've already placed one flag somewhere on the board.\n\nLooking at the board, I see some revealed numbers and some flagged spaces. I need to use these clues to determine where the bombs are and where it's safe to click.\n\nLet me start by examining the areas where I have some information.\n\nIn row 2, column 3, there's a '1'. Looking around it, there are other numbers and some flagged spaces. I need to see how these interact.\n\nWait, in row 3, column 3, there's a '1', and next to it is a flagged space at (3,5). There's also a '1' at (3,6), which is currently empty.\n\nHmm, let's see. The '1' at (3,3) has flagged space at (3,5). Are there other possible bomb locations around it?\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 4, column 2, which has a '1'. Around it, there's a '1' at (4,0), which is empty, and a '1' at (4,1), which is also empty.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for areas where I can deduce more clearly.\n\nLet me look at row 5, column 0, which has a '1'. Around it, there's another '1' at (5,1), and a '1' at (5,2). There's also a '1' at (5,5).\n\nThis seems like a cluster of '1's. Maybe I can find a pattern here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for areas where the number of adjacent flags equals the number on the tile. That would mean the remaining adjacent tiles are safe to click.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of adjacent flags is less than the number on the tile, then the remaining adjacent tiles must contain bombs, so I should flag them.\n\nLet me try to find such a situation.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5, which has a '3'. Around it, there's a '1' at (4,4), a '1' at (4,6), and a flagged space at (3,5).\n\nWait, (3,5) is flagged, which is one of the adjacent tiles to (4,5).\n\nSo, for (4,5), which is '3', it needs three adjacent bombs. Currently, one is flagged at (3,5). So, there must be two more bombs around it.\n\nThe possible locations for these bombs are: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nBut (5,5) is empty, and (4,5) is '3'. Wait, (4,5) is '3', which is already accounted for.\n\nWait, I need to be careful here. (4,5) is '3', and it's surrounded by these tiles:\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,5) [flagged]\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,6)\n\nOut of these, (3,5) is flagged, so that's one bomb. So, there need to be two more bombs among the remaining adjacent tiles.\n\nNow, looking at these tiles:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): empty\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): empty\n\n- (5,6): empty\n\nWait, actually, (5,5) is a '1', according to the board. Wait, no, in row 6, column 5 is '2', and row 5, column 5 is empty.\n\nWait, I need to check the board again carefully.\n\nRow 4, column 5 is '3'. Adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,5): flagged\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): empty\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): '2'\n\nOkay, so (5,5) is '1', and (5,6) is '2'.\n\nSo, for (4,5), which is '3', with one flagged adjacent tile, there must be two more bombs among: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nBut (5,5) is '1', which means it has one adjacent bomb, which is already flagged at (3,5). So, the other adjacent tiles to (5,5) should not contain bombs.\n\nWait, no. (5,5) is '1', and it's adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', and (3,5), which is flagged. So, for (5,5), which is '1', and it's adjacent to one flagged bomb at (3,5), that satisfies its count. So, the other adjacent tiles to (5,5) should not contain bombs.\n\nThe adjacent tiles to (5,5) are:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nBut some of these are out of bounds or already revealed.\n\nWait, no. The board is 10x10, so all these coordinates are valid.\n\nBut, (4,5) is '3', which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (5,5) is '1', which is a number, not a bomb. (3,5) is flagged, which is a bomb.\n\nSo, for (5,5), which is '1', and it's adjacent to one bomb at (3,5), that satisfies its count. Therefore, the other adjacent tiles should not contain bombs.\n\nSo, (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) should all be safe.\n\nWait, but (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6) are still unrevealed, so I can consider revealing them.\n\nBut, before doing that, I need to make sure that there are no conflicts with other numbers.\n\nLet me check (5,5), which is '1', and it's adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', and (3,5), which is flagged.\n\nSo, for (4,5), which is '3', it needs three adjacent bombs. One is at (3,5), so two more are needed among: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nNow, (5,5) is '1', and it's satisfied, so (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is '2', which is adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', (4,6), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7).\n\nWait, but (5,7) and (6,7) are not on the board yet, based on the given board state.\n\nWait, actually, the board goes up to column 9, row 9, but in the given board state, only up to column 9, row 9 is shown.\n\nBut in the board state provided, column 9 is shown only up to row 7, and then rows 8 and 9 have only columns 0 to 8.\n\nWait, I need to look back at the board state.\n\nWait, in the board state, column 9 has only rows 0 to 7 revealed, and rows 8 and 9 have columns 0 to 8 revealed.\n\nThis might be a typo or misalignment in the board state provided.\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll assume that the board is fully 10x10, and the unrevealed tiles are marked with '.'.\n\nSo, going back to (4,5), which is '3', needing two more bombs adjacent to it, besides the flagged one at (3,5).\n\nThe possible locations for these bombs are: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nBut, (5,4), (5,6) are adjacent to (5,5), which is '1', and since (5,5) only has one adjacent bomb at (3,5), the other adjacent tiles to (5,5) should not contain bombs.\n\nTherefore, (5,4), (5,6) should not contain bombs.\n\nSo, for (4,5), which needs two more bombs, the possible locations are: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6).\n\nNow, looking at these tiles:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): empty\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\nI need to see if any of these tiles are adjacent to other numbers that can give me more information.\n\nLet me look at (4,4). It's adjacent to (3,3), which is '1', (3,4), (3,5) [flagged], (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nWait, (4,4) is adjacent to:\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,5): flagged\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,5): '3'\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\nNow, (4,4) is adjacent to (3,5), which is flagged, and (5,5), which is '1' (satisfied), and (4,5), which is '3' (needs two more bombs).\n\nIf I flag (4,4), then for (4,5), which needs two more bombs, if I flag (4,4), that would be one of them.\n\nBut then, I need another bomb adjacent to (4,5). The remaining options are (3,4), (3,6), (4,6).\n\nNow, if I flag (4,4), then (4,5) would have two bombs adjacent to it: (3,5) and (4,4). But I need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at (3,3), which is '1'. It's adjacent to (2,3): '1', (2,4): '1', (2,5): '2', (3,4), (3,5): flagged, (4,3): empty, (4,4), (4,5): '3'.\n\nSo, for (3,3), which is '1', and it's adjacent to (3,5), which is flagged, that satisfies its count. So, the other adjacent tiles should not contain bombs.\n\nTherefore, (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) should not contain bombs, except for (4,5), which is '3'.\n\nWait, but (4,5) is '3', which is already accounted for with one flagged bomb at (3,5).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nI have 9 flags left to place, and there are 10 bombs in total. So far, I've placed one flag at (3,5).\n\nWait, no, flags remaining are 9, and bombs are 10, so I've placed 1 flag already.\n\nBut actually, flags remaining are 9, and bombs are 10, so I've placed 1 flag already.\n\nWait, no, flags remaining is 9, and bombs are 10, so I've placed 10 - 9 = 1 flag already.\n\nSo, I've placed one flag, and there are 9 flags left to place, meaning there are 10 bombs in total.\n\nWait, actually, flags remaining is 9, and bombs are 10, so I've placed 1 flag already.\n\nSo, I need to place 9 more flags to account for the remaining 9 bombs.\n\nWait, but if there are 10 bombs and I've placed 1 flag, then flags remaining should be 9, which matches the game info.\n\nSo, I need to place 9 more flags on the remaining bombs.\n\nNow, I need to find safe tiles to click or places to flag.\n\nLet me look for areas where I can deduce the positions of bombs with certainty.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 5, which is '2', and adjacent to it are (5,4): empty, (5,5): '1', (5,6): '2', (6,4): empty, (6,5): '2', (6,6): empty, (7,4): empty, (7,5): empty, (7,6): empty.\n\nWait, but in the board state, row 6, column 5 is '2'.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nRow 6:\n\n6 _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . . .\n\nSo, column 5 is '1', and column 6 is '2'.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier.\n\nRow 6: columns 0 to 4 are '_', column 5 is '1', column 6 is '2', and columns 7 to 9 are '.'.\n\nSimilarly, row 7: columns 0 to 1 are '_', column 2 is '1', column 3 is '1', column 4 is '1', column 5 is '.', columns 6 to 9 are '.'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at row 5, column 5, which is empty.\n\nRow 5: columns 0 to 2 are '1', column 3 is '_', column 4 is '_', column 5 is '1', columns 6 to 9 are '.'.\n\nWait, row 5, column 5 is '1'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at row 4, column 5, which is '3'.\n\nRow 4: columns 0 to 2 are '.', column 3 is '1', column 4 is '1', column 5 is '3', columns 6 to 9 are '.'.\n\nSo, (4,5) is '3', adjacent to (3,4), (3,5): flagged, (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5): '1', (5,6): '2'.\n\nAs previously determined, (5,5) is '1' and is satisfied with the flagged bomb at (3,5). Therefore, the other adjacent tiles to (5,5) should not contain bombs.\n\nSo, (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can safely click on any of these tiles.\n\nLet me choose to click on (5,4), which is adjacent to (5,5), which is '1', and all its bomb requirements are satisfied.\n\nSo, I'll choose to reveal (5,4).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed safely in this Minesweeper game, the next move should be to reveal a safe tile based on the current board state and the rules of the game.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze the Board:**\n   - Identify areas with revealed numbers and existing flags.\n   - Use the numbers to deduce the locations of bombs and safe tiles.\n\n2. **Deduce Safe Tiles:**\n   - Look for tiles adjacent to numbered tiles where the number of flags matches the number indicated.\n   - Ensure that the tiles are safe to reveal without conflicting with any revealed numbers.\n\n3. **Prioritize Moves:**\n   - Choose to reveal tiles that are confirmed safe based on the analysis.\n   - Avoid placing flags unless there is certainty about a bomb's location.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a Minesweeper game, the \"code\" is the move you make on the board. Based on the analysis, the next move should be:\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: Reveal (5,4) as it is adjacent to (5,5), which is '1' and already has its required flag.\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Revealed Tile (5,5):** This tile shows '1', indicating exactly one adjacent bomb. The bomb at (3,5) is already flagged, satisfying this condition.\n- **Safe Adjacent Tiles:** Since (5,5)'s requirement is met, the other adjacent tiles should be safe.\n- **Choosing (5,4):** This tile is adjacent to (5,5) and is unexplored, making it a safe choice to reveal next.\n\nBy following this approach, you can safely progress in the game without triggering a bomb.", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1 . .\n3 1 1 1 1 .

One is at (3,5), so two more are needed among: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nNow, (5,5) is '1', and it's satisfied, so (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is '2', which is adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', (4,6), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7).\n\nWait, but (5,7) and (6,7) are not on the board yet, based on the given board state.\n\nWait, actually, the board goes up to column 9, row 9, but in the given board state, only up to column 9, row 9 is shown.\n\nBut in the board state provided, column 9 is shown only up to row 7, and then rows 8 and 9 have only columns 0 to 8.\n\nWait, I need to look back at the board state.\n\nWait, in the board state, column 9 has only rows 0 to 7 revealed, and rows 8 and 9 have columns 0 to 8 revealed.\n\nThis might be a typo or misalignment in the board state provided.\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll assume that the board is fully 10x10, and the unrevealed tiles are marked with '.'.\n\nSo, going back to (4,5), which is '3', needing two more bombs adjacent to it, besides the flagged one at (3,5).\n\nThe possible locations for these bombs are: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nBut, (5,4), (5,6) are adjacent to (5,5), which is '1', and since (5,5) only has one adjacent bomb at (3,5), the other adjacent tiles to (5,5) should not contain bombs.\n\nTherefore, (5,4), (5,6) should not contain bombs.\n\nSo, for (4,5), which needs two more bombs, the possible locations are: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6).\n\nNow, looking at these tiles:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): empty\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\nI need to see if any of these tiles are adjacent to other numbers that can give me more information.\n\nLet me look at (4,4). It's adjacent to (3,3), which is '1', (3,4), (3,5) [flagged], (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nWait, (4,4) is adjacent to:\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,5): flagged\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,5): '3'\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\nNow, (4,4) is adjacent to (3,5), which is flagged, and (5,5), which is '1' (satisfied), and (4,5), which is '3' (needs two more bombs).\n\nIf I flag (4,4), then for (4,5), which needs two more bombs, if I flag (4,4), that would be one of them.\n\nBut then, I need another bomb adjacent to (4,5). The remaining options are (3,4), (3,6), (4,6).\n\nNow, if I flag (4,4), then (4,5) would have two bombs adjacent to it: (3,5) and (4,4). But I need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at (3,3), which is '1'. It's adjacent to (2,3): '1', (2,4): '1', (2,5): '2', (3,4), (3,5): flagged, (4,3): empty, (4,4), (4,5): '3'.\n\nSo, for (3,3), which is '1', and it's adjacent to (3,5), which is flagged, that satisfies its count. So, the other adjacent tiles should not contain bombs.\n\nTherefore, (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) should not contain bombs, except for (4,5), which is '3'.\n\nWait, but (4,5) is '3', which is already accounted for with one flagged bomb at (3,5).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nI have 9 flags left to place, and there are 10 bombs in total. So far, I've placed one flag at (3,5).\n\nWait, no, flags remaining are 9, and bombs are 10, so I've placed 1 flag already.\n\nBut actually, flags remaining are 9, and bombs are 10, so I've placed 1 flag already.\n\nWait, no, flags remaining is 9, and bombs are 10, so I've placed 10 - 9 = 1 flag already.\n\nSo, I've placed one flag, and there are 9 flags left to place, meaning there are 10 bombs in total.\n\nWait, actually, flags remaining is 9, and bombs are 10, so I've placed 1 flag already.\n\nSo, I need to place 9 more flags to account for the remaining 9 bombs.\n\nWait, but if there are 10 bombs and I've placed 1 flag, then flags remaining should be 9, which matches the game info.\n\nSo, I need to place 9 more flags on the remaining bombs.\n\nNow, I need to find safe tiles to click or places to flag.\n\nLet me look for areas where I can deduce the positions of bombs with certainty.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 5, which is '2', and adjacent to it are (5,4): empty, (5,5): '1', (5,6): '2', (6,4): empty, (6,5): '2', (6,6): empty, (7,4): empty, (7,5): empty, (7,6): empty.\n\nWait, but in the board state, row 6, column 5 is '2'.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nRow 6:\n\n6 _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . . .\n\nSo, column 5 is '1', and column 6 is '2'.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier.\n\nRow 6: columns 0 to 4 are '_', column 5 is '1', column 6 is '2', and columns 7 to 9 are '.'.\n\nSimilarly, row 7: columns 0 to 1 are '_', column 2 is '1', column 3 is '1', column 4 is '1', column 5 is '.', columns 6 to 9 are '.'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at row 5, column 5, which is empty.\n\nRow 5: columns 0 to 2 are '1', column 3 is '_', column 4 is '_', column 5 is '1', columns 6 to 9 are '.'.\n\nWait, row 5, column 5 is '1'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at row 4, column 5, which is '3'.\n\nRow 4: columns 0 to 2 are '.', column 3 is '1', column 4 is '1', column 5 is '3', columns 6 to 9 are '.'.\n\nSo, (4,5) is '3', adjacent to (3,4), (3,5): flagged, (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5): '1', (5,6): '2'.\n\nAs previously determined, (5,5) is '1' and is satisfied with the flagged bomb at (3,5). Therefore, the other adjacent tiles to (5,5) should not contain bombs.\n\nSo, (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can safely click on any of these tiles.\n\nLet me choose to click on (5,4), which is adjacent to (5,5), which is '1', and all its bomb requirements are satisfied.\n\nSo, I'll choose to reveal (5,4).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed safely in this Minesweeper game, the next move should be to reveal a safe tile based on the current board state and the rules of the game.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze the Board:**\n   - Identify areas with revealed numbers and existing flags.\n   - Use the numbers to deduce the locations of bombs and safe tiles.\n\n2. **Deduce Safe Tiles:**\n   - Look for tiles adjacent to numbered tiles where the number of flags matches the number indicated.\n   - Ensure that the tiles are safe to reveal without conflicting with any revealed numbers.\n\n3. **Prioritize Moves:**\n   - Choose to reveal tiles that are confirmed safe based on the analysis.\n   - Avoid placing flags unless there is certainty about a bomb's location.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a Minesweeper game, the \"code\" is the move you make on the board. Based on the analysis, the next move should be:\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: Reveal (5,4) as it is adjacent to (5,5), which is '1' and already has its required flag.\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Revealed Tile (5,5):** This tile shows '1', indicating exactly one adjacent bomb. The bomb at (3,5) is already flagged, satisfying this condition.\n- **Safe Adjacent Tiles:** Since (5,5)'s requirement is met, the other adjacent tiles should be safe.\n- **Choosing (5,4):** This tile is adjacent to (5,5) and is unexplored, making it a safe choice to reveal next.\n\nBy following this approach, you can safely progress in the game without triggering a bomb.", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1 . .\n3 1 1 1 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board and trying to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means I've already placed one flag somewhere on the board.\n\nLooking at the board, I see some revealed numbers and some flagged spaces. I need to use these clues to determine where the bombs are and where it's safe to click.\n\nLet me start by examining the areas where I have some information.\n\nIn row 2, column 3, there's a '1'. Looking around it, there are other numbers and some flagged spaces. I need to see how these interact.\n\nWait, in row 3, column 3, there's a '1', and next to it is a flagged space at (3,5). There's also a '1' at (3,6), which is currently empty.\n\nHmm, let's see. The '1' at (3,3) has flagged space at (3,5). Are there other possible bomb locations around it?\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 4, column 2, which has a '1'. Around it, there's a '1' at (4,0), which is empty, and a '1' at (4,1), which is also empty.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for areas where I can deduce more clearly.\n\nLet me look at row 5, column 0, which has a '1'. Around it, there's another '1' at (5,1), and a '1' at (5,2). There's also a '1' at (5,5).\n\nThis seems like a cluster of '1's. Maybe I can find a pattern here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for areas where the number of adjacent flags equals the number on the tile. That would mean the remaining adjacent tiles are safe to click.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of adjacent flags is less than the number on the tile, then the remaining adjacent tiles must contain bombs, so I should flag them.\n\nLet me try to find such a situation.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5, which has a '3'. Around it, there's a '1' at (4,4), a '1' at (4,6), and a flagged space at (3,5).\n\nWait, (3,5) is flagged, which is one of the adjacent tiles to (4,5).\n\nSo, for (4,5), which is '3', it needs three adjacent bombs. Currently, one is flagged at (3,5). So, there must be two more bombs among the other adjacent tiles.\n\nThe adjacent tiles to (4,5) are:\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\n- (4,4), (4,6)\n\n- (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nOut of these, (3,5) is flagged, so that's one bomb. That leaves two more bombs to be placed among the remaining tiles.\n\nLooking at these tiles:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): '1'\n\n- (4,6): '1'\n\n- (5,4): '1'\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): empty\n\nHmm, so (4,4) and (4,6) are both '1's, which means each of them has exactly one bomb adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) and (5,5) are '1's, each with exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\nGiven that (3,5) is already flagged, which is adjacent to both (4,4) and (4,6), but also to (3,4), (3,6), (4,5), (5,5), etc.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look at another area.\n\nLet me look at row 6, column 5, which has a '2'. Around it, there's a '1' at (6,4), and a '2' at (6,6).\n\nWait, (6,4) is '1', (6,5) is '2', (6,6) is '2'.\n\nLooking at (6,5), which is '2', it needs two adjacent bombs.\n\nAdjacent tiles are:\n\n- (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\n- (6,4), (6,6)\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\nLooking at these tiles:\n\n- (5,4): '1'\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): empty\n\n- (6,4): '1'\n\n- (6,6): '2'\n\n- (7,4): '1'\n\n- (7,5): empty\n\n- (7,6): empty\n\nSo, for (6,5), which is '2', it needs two adjacent bombs.\n\nLooking at the adjacent tiles, (5,4) is '1', which needs one adjacent bomb, and (5,5) is '1', which also needs one adjacent bomb.\n\nBut I need to see if any of these tiles are already flagged or if I can deduce where the bombs are.\n\nWait, I don't see any flags around (6,5). So, I need to place two bombs among the adjacent tiles that are not yet revealed or flagged.\n\nBut I need to make sure that placing bombs in certain positions doesn't conflict with the numbers around them.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should look for tiles that are definitely safe to click because all adjacent bombs are already flagged.\n\nLet me look for a '1' that has one flagged adjacent tile, and all other adjacent tiles are either revealed or flagged.\n\nFor example, look at (5,0), which is '1'. Around it:\n\n- (4,0): '1'\n\n- (4,1): '1'\n\n- (5,1): '1'\n\n- (6,0): '1'\n\n- (6,1): '1'\n\nNone of these have flags, so I don't know where the bomb for (5,0)'s '1' is.\n\nThis isn't helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 2, column 6, which has a '1'. Around it:\n\n- (1,6): empty\n\n- (1,7): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '2'\n\n- (2,7): '1'\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (3,7): empty\n\n- (4,6): '3'\n\nWait, (2,5) is '2', which is adjacent to (2,6)'s '1'.\n\nThis seems too vague.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total number of flags I have left and see if I can find areas where I must place them.\n\nI have 9 flags left, and there are 10 bombs in total. So, I've already placed one flag.\n\nBut looking at the board, I see that there are more than 9 unflagged, unrevealed tiles. So, I need to be careful where I place the remaining flags.\n\nWait, actually, with 10 bombs and one flag already placed, I have 9 flags left for 9 remaining bombs.\n\nSo, the number of remaining bombs equals the number of flags left.\n\nThis means that every bomb not yet flagged must correspond to one of the unflagged, unrevealed tiles.\n\nSo, I need to ensure that I place flags only on tiles that are definitely bombs, and reveal tiles that are safe.\n\nGiven that, I should look for tiles that are definitely bombs and place flags there, and avoid placing flags on tiles that might not be bombs.\n\nLooking back at the board, perhaps I should look at row 8 and 9, where there are some unrevealed tiles.\n\nIn row 8, column 1, there's a '1'. Around it:\n\n- (7,1): '1'\n\n- (7,2): '1'\n\n- (8,0): '1'\n\n- (8,2): empty\n\n- (9,1): '1'\n\n- (9,0): '1'\n\nNone of these are flagged, so the '1' at (8,1) has one adjacent bomb among these tiles.\n\nBut I don't have enough information here to determine which one is the bomb.\n\nSimilarly, in row 9, column 1, which is '1', has adjacent tiles:\n\n- (8,1): '1'\n\n- (8,2): empty\n\n- (9,0): '1'\n\n- (9,2): empty\n\nAgain, not enough information.\n\nMaybe I should look back at row 4, column 5, which is '3', and see if I can determine where the two remaining bombs around it are, given that one is already flagged at (3,5).\n\nLooking at the adjacent tiles:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): '1'\n\n- (4,6): '1'\n\n- (5,4): '1'\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): empty\n\nSo, for (4,5)'s '3', with one flag at (3,5), I need two more bombs among these tiles.\n\nBut, (4,4) is '1', which already has one adjacent bomb at (3,5), so it cannot have any more bombs adjacent to it.\n\nTherefore, the two remaining bombs for (4,5) must be among:\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,6)\n\nBut (4,6) is '1', which needs only one adjacent bomb. Since (3,5) is already a bomb adjacent to it, it cannot have any more bombs adjacent to it.\n\nTherefore, (4,6) cannot have any bombs adjacent to it other than (3,5).\n\nSo, the two remaining bombs for (4,5) must be among:\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,6)\n\nNow, looking at (5,4), which is '1', it needs one adjacent bomb.\n\nIts adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (4,3): empty\n\n- (4,4): '1'\n\n- (4,5): '3'\n\n- (5,3): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (6,3): empty\n\n- (6,4): '1'\n\n- (6,5): '1'\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to list all adjacent tiles for (5,4):\n\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\n- (5,3), (5,5)\n\n- (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nBut some of these are revealed, some are empty.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a tile that is definitely safe to click.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0, which is empty. Maybe I can click there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that it's safe.\n\nWait, but I don't have any information about that area yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at row 7, column 0, which is empty.\n\nBut again, no information there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the flags I've already placed are correct and use that as a basis.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should look for areas where the number of flags equals the number on the tile, indicating that the remaining adjacent tiles are safe.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has one flag adjacent to it, then the remaining adjacent tiles are safe.\n\nLooking at (3,3), which is '1', and it has a flag at (3,5). But (3,5) is not adjacent to (3,3). Wait, (3,3) is row 3, column 3, and (3,5) is row 3, column 5, which are two columns apart, so not adjacent.\n\nWait, no, in Minesweeper, adjacent includes diagonally neighboring tiles.\n\nSo, (3,3) is adjacent to:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n- (3,2), (3,4)\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nNone of these include (3,5).\n\nSo, (3,5) is not adjacent to (3,3). Therefore, the flag at (3,5) doesn't affect (3,3)'s count.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3)'s '1' needs one bomb among its adjacent tiles.\n\nLooking at its adjacent tiles:\n\n- (2,2): empty\n\n- (2,3): empty\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): empty\n\n- (3,4): '1'\n\n- (4,2): '1'\n\n- (4,3): empty\n\n- (4,4): empty\n\nNone of these are flagged, so one of these must be a bomb.\n\nBut I don't know which one specifically.\n\nThis isn't helpful.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability and choose a tile that seems safer to click.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a tile that, if it's a bomb, would contradict the numbers around it.\n\nFor example, if clicking a particular tile would cause a conflict with the revealed numbers, then it must be safe.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should just pick a tile that seems safe based on the current information.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0, which is empty. Since it's next to a '1' at (0,7), but that '1' is far away, and there are many unrevealed tiles between them, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the flags I've placed are correct and proceed accordingly.\n\nWait, I have a flag at (3,5). Assuming that's correct, then I can use that information to deduce the positions of other bombs.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should look at row 6, column 5, which is '2', and see if I can determine where the two bombs around it are.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (6,5):\n\n- (5,4): '1'\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): empty\n\n- (6,4): '1'\n\n- (6,6): '2'\n\n- (7,4): '1'\n\n- (7,5): empty\n\n- (7,6): empty\n\nFor (6,5)'s '2', with two bombs needed among these tiles.\n\nLooking at (5,4), which is '1', it needs one adjacent bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is '1', needing one adjacent bomb.\n\n(6,4) is '1', needing one adjacent bomb.\n\n(6,6) is '2', needing two adjacent bombs.\n\n(7,4) is '1', needing one adjacent bomb.\n\n(7,5) and (7,6) are empty.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider that the two bombs for (6,5) are at (5,4) and (5,5), but that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of them is at (7,5) or (7,6).\n\nBut then, (7,4) is '1', which needs one adjacent bomb, which could be at (7,5).\n\nThis is too tangled. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a tile that, when revealed, would give me more information without risking a bomb.\n\nFor example, clicking on a tile that is adjacent to multiple numbers, so that if it's safe, it reveals a cluster of tiles.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0, which is empty, and clicking there might reveal a bunch of tiles if it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, clicking on row 7, column 0, which is empty, might do the same.\n\nBut I need to be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place a flag on a tile that I'm certain is a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5, which is '3', and it needs two more bombs besides the one at (3,5).\n\nLooking at the adjacent tiles:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): '1'\n\n- (4,6): '1'\n\n- (5,4): '1'\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): empty\n\nConsidering that (4,4) is '1', and it already has one adjacent bomb at (3,5), it cannot have any more bombs adjacent to it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is '1', which also has one adjacent bomb at (3,5), so no more bombs around it.\n\nTherefore, the two remaining bombs for (4,5) must be among:\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,6)\n\nNow, looking at (5,4), which is '1', it needs one adjacent bomb.\n\nIts adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (4,3): empty\n\n- (4,4): '1'\n\n- (4,5): '3'\n\n- (5,3): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (6,3): empty\n\n- (6,4): '1'\n\n- (6,5): '1'\n\nSo, for (5,4)'s '1', it needs one adjacent bomb among these tiles.\n\nGiven that (4,5) is '3' and needs two more bombs, and (5,5) is '1', which needs one adjacent bomb.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider that (3,4) and (3,6) are possible bomb locations for (4,5)'s remaining bombs.\n\nBut (3,4) is adjacent to (2,3)'s '1', which already has no flags around it, so placing a bomb there would mean that (2,3)'s '1' is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is adjacent to (2,5)'s '2', which might have other bombs around it.\n\nThis is too unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this, perhaps I should just pick a tile that seems safe and click on it.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0, which is empty, and doesn't seem to be near any flags or problematic areas.\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The tile at (1,0) is empty and doesn't seem to be near any flags or problematic areas, so it appears to be a safe choice to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,0,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1 . .\n3 1 1 1 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board and trying to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means I've already placed one flag somewhere on the board.\n\nLooking at the board, I see some revealed numbers and some flagged spaces. I need to use these clues to determine where the bombs are and where it's safe to click.\n\nLet me start by examining the areas where I have some information.\n\nIn row 2, column 3, there's a '1'. Looking around it, there are other numbers and some flagged spaces. I need to see how these interact.\n\nWait, in row 3, column 3, there's a '1', and next to it is a flagged space at (3,5). There's also a '1' at (3,6), which is currently empty.\n\nHmm, let's see. The '1' at (3,3) has flagged space at (3,5). Are there other possible bomb locations around it?\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 4, column 2, which has a '1'. Around it, there's a '1' at (4,0), which is empty, and a '1' at (4,1), which is also empty.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for areas where I can deduce more clearly.\n\nLet me look at row 5, column 0, which has a '1'. Around it, there's another '1' at (5,1), and a '1' at (5,2). There's also a '1' at (5,5).\n\nThis seems like a cluster of '1's. Maybe I can find a pattern here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for areas where the number of adjacent flags equals the number on the tile. That would mean the remaining adjacent tiles are safe to click.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of adjacent flags is less than the number on the tile, then the remaining adjacent tiles must contain bombs, so I should flag them.\n\nLet me try to find such a situation.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5, which has a '3'. Around it, there's a '1' at (4,4), a '1' at (4,6), and a flagged space at (3,5).\n\nWait, (3,5) is flagged, which is one of the adjacent tiles to (4,5).\n\nSo, for (4,5), which is '3', it needs three adjacent bombs. Currently, one is flagged at (3,5). So, there must be two more bombs around it.\n\nThe possible locations for these bombs are: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nBut (5,5) is empty, and (4,5) is '3'. Wait, (4,5) is '3', which is already accounted for.\n\nWait, I need to be careful here. (4,5) is '3', and it's surrounded by these tiles:\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,5) [flagged]\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,6)\n\nOut of these, (3,5) is flagged, so that's one bomb. So, there need to be two more bombs among the remaining adjacent tiles.\n\nNow, looking at these tiles:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): empty\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): empty\n\n- (5,6): empty\n\nWait, actually, (5,5) is a '1', according to the board. Wait, no, in row 6, column 5 is '2', and row 5, column 5 is empty.\n\nWait, I need to check the board again carefully.\n\nRow 4, column 5 is '3'. Adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,5): flagged\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): empty\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): '2'\n\nOkay, so (5,5) is '1', and (5,6) is '2'.\n\nSo, for (4,5), which is '3', with one flagged adjacent tile, there must be two more bombs among: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nBut (5,5) is '1', which means it has one adjacent bomb, which is already flagged at (3,5). So, the other adjacent tiles to (5,5) should not contain bombs.\n\nWait, no. (5,5) is '1', and it's adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', and (3,5), which is flagged. So, for (5,5), which is '1', and it's adjacent to one flagged bomb at (3,5), that satisfies its count. So, the other adjacent tiles to (5,5) should not contain bombs.\n\nThe adjacent tiles to (5,5) are:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nBut some of these are out of bounds or already revealed.\n\nWait, no. The board is 10x10, so all these coordinates are valid.\n\nBut, (4,5) is '3', which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (5,5) is '1', which is a number, not a bomb. (3,5) is flagged, which is a bomb.\n\nSo, for (5,5), which is '1', and it's adjacent to one bomb at (3,5), that satisfies its count. Therefore, the other adjacent tiles should not contain bombs.\n\nSo, (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) should all be safe.\n\nWait, but (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6) are still unrevealed, so I can consider revealing them.\n\nBut, before doing that, I need to make sure that there are no conflicts with other numbers.\n\nLet me check (5,5), which is '1', and it's adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', and (3,5), which is flagged.\n\nSo, for (4,5), which is '3', it needs three adjacent bombs. One is at (3,5), so two more are needed among: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nNow, (5,5) is '1', and it's satisfied, so (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is '2', which is adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', (4,6), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7).\n\nWait, but (5,7) and (6,7) are not on the board yet, based on the given board state.\n\nWait, actually, the board goes up to column 9, row 9, but in the given board state, only up to column 9, row 9 is shown.\n\nBut in the board state provided, column 9 is shown only up to row 7, and then rows 8 and 9 have only columns 0 to 8.\n\nWait, I need to look back at the board state.\n\nWait, in the board state, column 9 has only rows 0 to 7 revealed, and rows 8 and 9 have columns 0 to 8 revealed.\n\nThis might be a typo or misalignment in the board state provided.\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll assume that the board is fully 10x10, and the unrevealed tiles are marked with '.'.\n\nSo, going back to (4,5), which is '3', needing two more bombs adjacent to it, besides the flagged one at (3,5).\n\nThe possible locations for these bombs are: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nBut, (5,4), (5,6) are adjacent to (5,5), which is '1', and since (5,5) only has one adjacent bomb at (3,5), the other adjacent tiles to (5,5) should not contain bombs.\n\nTherefore, (5,4), (5,6) should not contain bombs.\n\nSo, for (4,5), which needs two more bombs, the possible locations are: (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6).\n\nNow, looking at these tiles:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): empty\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\nI need to see if any of these tiles are adjacent to other numbers that can give me more information.\n\nLet me look at (4,4). It's adjacent to (3,3), which is '1', (3,4), (3,5) [flagged], (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nWait, (4,4) is adjacent to:\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,5): flagged\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,5): '3'\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\nNow, (4,4) is adjacent to (3,5), which is flagged, and (5,5), which is '1' (satisfied), and (4,5), which is '3' (needs two more bombs).\n\nIf I flag (4,4), then for (4,5), which needs two more bombs, if I flag (4,4), that would be one of them.\n\nBut then, I need another bomb adjacent to (4,5). The remaining options are (3,4), (3,6), (4,6).\n\nNow, if I flag (4,4), then (4,5) would have two bombs adjacent to it: (3,5) and (4,4). But I need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at (3,3), which is '1'. It's adjacent to (2,3): '1', (2,4): '1', (2,5): '2', (3,4), (3,5): flagged, (4,3): empty, (4,4), (4,5): '3'.\n\nSo, for (3,3), which is '1', and it's adjacent to (3,5), which is flagged, that satisfies its count. So, the other adjacent tiles should not contain bombs.\n\nTherefore, (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) should not contain bombs, except for (4,5), which is '3'.\n\nWait, but (4,5) is '3', which is already accounted for with one flagged bomb at (3,5).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nI have 9 flags left to place, and there are 10 bombs in total. So far, I've placed one flag at (3,5).\n\nWait, no, flags remaining are 9, and bombs are 10, so I've placed 1 flag already.\n\nBut actually, flags remaining are 9, and bombs are 10, so I've placed 1 flag already.\n\nWait, no, flags remaining is 9, and bombs are 10, so I've placed 10 - 9 = 1 flag already.\n\nSo, I've placed one flag, and there are 9 flags left to place, meaning there are 10 bombs in total.\n\nWait, actually, flags remaining is 9, and bombs are 10, so I've placed 1 flag already.\n\nSo, I need to place 9 more flags to account for the remaining 9 bombs.\n\nWait, but if there are 10 bombs and I've placed 1 flag, then flags remaining should be 9, which matches the game info.\n\nSo, I need to place 9 more flags on the remaining bombs.\n\nNow, I need to find safe tiles to click or places to flag.\n\nLet me look for areas where I can deduce the positions of bombs with certainty.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 5, which is '2', and adjacent to it are (5,4): empty, (5,5): '1', (5,6): '2', (6,4): empty, (6,5): '2', (6,6): empty, (7,4): empty, (7,5): empty, (7,6): empty.\n\nWait, but in the board state, row 6, column 5 is '2'.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nRow 6:\n\n6 _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . . .\n\nSo, column 5 is '1', and column 6 is '2'.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier.\n\nRow 6: columns 0 to 4 are '_', column 5 is '1', column 6 is '2', and columns 7 to 9 are '.'.\n\nSimilarly, row 7: columns 0 to 1 are '_', column 2 is '1', column 3 is '1', column 4 is '1', column 5 is '.', columns 6 to 9 are '.'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at row 5, column 5, which is empty.\n\nRow 5: columns 0 to 2 are '1', column 3 is '_', column 4 is '_', column 5 is '1', columns 6 to 9 are '.'.\n\nWait, row 5, column 5 is '1'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at row 4, column 5, which is '3'.\n\nRow 4: columns 0 to 2 are '.', column 3 is '1', column 4 is '1', column 5 is '3', columns 6 to 9 are '.'.\n\nSo, (4,5) is '3', adjacent to (3,4), (3,5): flagged, (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5): '1', (5,6): '2'.\n\nAs previously determined, (5,5) is '1' and is satisfied with the flagged bomb at (3,5). Therefore, the other adjacent tiles to (5,5) should not contain bombs.\n\nSo, (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can safely click on any of these tiles.\n\nLet me choose to click on (5,4), which is adjacent to (5,5), which is '1', and all its bomb requirements are satisfied.\n\nSo, I'll choose to reveal (5,4).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed safely in this Minesweeper game, the next move should be to reveal a safe tile based on the current board state and the rules of the game.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze the Board:**\n   - Identify areas with revealed numbers and existing flags.\n   - Use the numbers to deduce the locations of bombs and safe tiles.\n\n2. **Deduce Safe Tiles:**\n   - Look for tiles adjacent to numbered tiles where the number of flags matches the number indicated.\n   - Ensure that the tiles are safe to reveal without conflicting with any revealed numbers.\n\n3. **Prioritize Moves:**\n   - Choose to reveal tiles that are confirmed safe based on the analysis.\n   - Avoid placing flags unless there is certainty about a bomb's location.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a Minesweeper game, the \"code\" is the move you make on the board. Based on the analysis, the next move should be:\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: Reveal (5,4) as it is adjacent to (5,5), which is '1' and already has its required flag.\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Revealed Tile (5,5):** This tile shows '1', indicating exactly one adjacent bomb. The bomb at (3,5) is already flagged, satisfying this condition.\n- **Safe Adjacent Tiles:** Since (5,5)'s requirement is met, the other adjacent tiles should be safe.\n- **Choosing (5,4):** This tile is adjacent to (5,5) and is unexplored, making it a safe choice to reveal next.\n\nBy following this approach, you can safely progress in the game without triggering a bomb.", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1 . .\n3 1 1 1 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board and trying to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means I've already placed one flag somewhere on the board.\n\nLooking at the board, I see some revealed numbers and some flagged spaces. I need to use these clues to determine where the bombs are and where it's safe to click.\n\nLet me start by examining the areas where I have some information.\n\nIn row 2, column 3, there's a '1'. Looking around it, there are other numbers and some flagged spaces. I need to see how these interact.\n\nWait, in row 3, column 3, there's a '1', and next to it is a flagged space at (3,5). There's also a '1' at (3,6), which is currently empty.\n\nHmm, let's see. The '1' at (3,3) has flagged space at (3,5). Are there other possible bomb locations around it?\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 4, column 2, which has a '1'. Around it, there's a '1' at (4,3), a '1' at (4,4), and a '3' at (4,5).\n\nThe '3' at (4,5) is interesting because it's surrounded by several spaces, some of which are flagged.\n\nWait, actually, let's look at the '3' at (4,5). It's surrounded by:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,5): flagged\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): '1'\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): '1'\n\nSo, the '3' at (4,5) has three adjacent bombs. One of them is at (3,5), which is already flagged. That means there are two more bombs around it.\n\nLooking at the remaining spaces around (4,5):\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,6): empty\n\n- (4,4): '1' (which already has one bomb adjacent, at (3,5))\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): '1'\n\nSo, out of these, which ones could be bombs?\n\nWell, (3,4) and (3,6) are empty, so they could be either safe or bombs.\n\n(4,4) is a '1', which already has one adjacent bomb at (3,5), so it can't have any more bombs adjacent to it. That means (3,4) and (3,6) can't both be bombs, because (4,4) would then have more than one adjacent bomb.\n\nWait, no. (4,4) is a '1', and it already has one adjacent bomb at (3,5), so it can't have any more bombs adjacent to it. Therefore, the spaces adjacent to (4,4) that aren't (3,5) can't be bombs.\n\nWhat are the spaces adjacent to (4,4)?\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nBut (3,5) is already a bomb, so none of the others can be bombs.\n\nWait, but (3,5) is already a bomb, so the '1' at (4,4) has its only adjacent bomb at (3,5). Therefore, none of the other adjacent spaces to (4,4) can be bombs.\n\nSo, (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (5,3), and (5,4) are all safe.\n\nWait, but (5,4) is already revealed as empty, so that's fine.\n\nSo, (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), and (5,3) are safe.\n\nWait, but (3,3) is a '1', which is already revealed.\n\nSo, (3,4) and (4,3) can be safely revealed.\n\nBut let's see what's at (3,4) and (4,3).\n\nAt (3,4), it's empty, so it's safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is a '1', which is already revealed.\n\nSo, perhaps I can reveal (3,4).\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider.\n\nLooking back at the '3' at (4,5), which has already one bomb at (3,5), so it needs two more bombs adjacent to it.\n\nThe possible locations for those bombs are:\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,6)\n\nBut, we've established that (3,4) and (5,4) are safe because of the '1' at (4,4).\n\nWait, but (5,4) is already revealed as empty.\n\nSo, (3,4) can't be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is safe.\n\nTherefore, the possible locations for the remaining two bombs around (4,5) are:\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (5,6)\n\nNow, looking at (3,6), it's empty.\n\n(4,6) is empty.\n\n(5,6) is a '1'.\n\nWait, the '1' at (5,6) indicates that there is one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nWhat are the spaces adjacent to (5,6)?\n\n- (4,5): '3'\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (4,7): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,7): empty\n\n- (6,5): '2'\n\n- (6,6): '1'\n\n- (6,7): empty\n\nSo, the '1' at (5,6) has one adjacent bomb, which could be at (4,6) or (6,6).\n\nBut wait, (6,6) is a '1', which means it has one adjacent bomb.\n\nWhat are the spaces adjacent to (6,6)?\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): '1'\n\n- (5,7): empty\n\n- (6,5): '2'\n\n- (6,7): empty\n\n- (7,5): '1'\n\n- (7,6): empty\n\n- (7,7): empty\n\nSo, the '1' at (6,6) has one adjacent bomb, which could be at (6,5), which is a '2'.\n\nWait, (6,5) is a '2', which means it has two adjacent bombs.\n\nWhat are the spaces adjacent to (6,5)?\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): '1'\n\n- (6,4): empty\n\n- (6,6): '1'\n\n- (7,4): empty\n\n- (7,5): '1'\n\n- (7,6): empty\n\nSo, the '2' at (6,5) has two adjacent bombs.\n\nCurrently, there are no flags around it, but we need to see.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at another part of the board.\n\nLet's look at the top part of the board.\n\nIn row 0, columns 0 through 9, there are some revealed numbers.\n\nWait, row 0:\n\n(0,0): empty\n\n(0,1): empty\n\n...\n\n(0,7): '1'\n\n(0,8): '.'\n\n(0,9): '.'\n\nSimilarly, row 1:\n\n(1,0): empty\n\n(1,1): empty\n\n...\n\n(1,7): '1'\n\n(1,8): '.'\n\n(1,9): '.'\n\nRow 2:\n\n(2,0): empty\n\n(2,1): empty\n\n(2,2): empty\n\n(2,3): '1'\n\n(2,4): '1'\n\n(2,5): '2'\n\n(2,6): '1'\n\n(2,7): '1'\n\n(2,8): '.'\n\n(2,9): '.'\n\nOkay, so in row 2, there are some numbers.\n\nLet's see if I can deduce something from these numbers.\n\nLooking at (2,3): '1'\n\nWhat's around it?\n\n- (1,2): empty\n\n- (1,3): empty\n\n- (1,4): empty\n\n- (2,2): empty\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\nSo, the '1' at (2,3) has one adjacent bomb.\n\nLooking at its adjacent spaces:\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), (2,2), (1,2), (3,2)\n\nAmong these, which ones could be bombs?\n\nWell, (3,2) is a '1', which means it has one adjacent bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is a '1', which has one adjacent bomb.\n\n(2,4) is a '1', which has one adjacent bomb.\n\nSo, there are multiple '1's in this area, which makes it a bit tricky.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a place where I can safely place a flag or reveal a space without risking a bomb.\n\nLooking back at the '3' at (4,5), which has one flag at (3,5), and needs two more bombs around it.\n\nPossible locations: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)\n\nNow, (3,6) is empty, (4,6) is empty, and (5,6) is a '1'.\n\nThe '1' at (5,6) needs one bomb adjacent to it, which could be at (4,6) or (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is a '1', which also needs one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nThis seems a bit circular.\n\nMaybe I should look at another part of the board.\n\nLet's look at row 6.\n\nRow 6:\n\n(6,0): empty\n\n(6,1): empty\n\n(6,2): empty\n\n(6,3): empty\n\n(6,4): empty\n\n(6,5): '2'\n\n(6,6): '1'\n\n(6,7): '.'\n\n(6,8): '.'\n\n(6,9): '.'\n\nOkay, so (6,5) is a '2', which has two adjacent bombs.\n\nWhat are the spaces adjacent to (6,5)?\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (5,6): '2'\n\n- (6,4): empty\n\n- (6,6): '1'\n\n- (7,4): empty\n\n- (7,5): '1'\n\n- (7,6): empty\n\nSo, out of these, which ones could be bombs?\n\nWell, (5,5) is a '1', which has one adjacent bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is a '1', which has one adjacent bomb.\n\n(7,5) is a '1', which has one adjacent bomb.\n\nSo, for (6,5)'s two adjacent bombs, possible locations are:\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (7,4)\n\n- (7,6)\n\nWait, but (5,4) is empty, (6,4) is empty, (7,4) is empty, and (7,6) is empty.\n\nSo, two of these must be bombs.\n\nBut, considering the '1's around them, I need to see if I can deduce which ones are safe.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a contradiction or a definite safe space.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to reveal a space that seems safe based on the numbers I have.\n\nLooking back at row 3, column 4, which is empty.\n\nAround it:\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '2'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\n- (3,5): flagged\n\n- (4,3): '1'\n\n- (4,4): '1'\n\n- (4,5): '3'\n\nGiven that (3,5) is a flagged bomb, and (4,5) is a '3' with one flag already, I can consider that.\n\nBut it's still not clear.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the total number of flags remaining.\n\nI have 9 flags remaining, and there are 10 bombs in total.\n\nSo, I've placed 1 flag so far.\n\nBut wait, in the board, I see a flag at (3,5), and perhaps others.\n\nWait, in the board description, I see:\n\n- (3,5): F\n\nIs that the only flag placed so far?\n\nLooking at the board, I see only one 'F' at (3,5).\n\nSo, I've placed one flag, and have 9 flags remaining, with 10 bombs in total.\n\nSo, I need to place 9 more flags.\n\nBut I need to be careful where I place them.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to reveal a space that I think is safe.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4, which is empty.\n\nGiven that (4,4) is a '1' with its only adjacent bomb at (3,5), then (3,4) should be safe.\n\nSo, perhaps I can reveal (3,4).\n\nBut before doing that, let's double-check.\n\n(4,4) is a '1', with adjacent bombs:\n\n- (3,5): flagged\n\nTherefore, none of the other adjacent spaces can be bombs.\n\nSo, (3,4) is adjacent to (4,4), so it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal (3,4).\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the '1' at (4,4) having its only adjacent bomb at (3,5), the space at (3,4) is safe to reveal.\n\nMOVE: 3,4,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1 . .\n3 1 1 1 1 .
