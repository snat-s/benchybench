The adjacent squares are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). None of these are flagged or revealed yet.

Since (3,3) needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares, and we have no information yet, (3,2) is a safe bet to reveal.\n\n### MOVE: 3,2,false\nThis move reveals tile (3,2) without placing a flag.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 9, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "### Step 1: Check all revealed numbers against existing flags\n\nFirst, I'll scan the board for any revealed numbers and see if they align with the existing flags. Since there are no flags on the board yet, this step is straightforward. All numbers must correspond to the number of adjacent bombs.\n\n### Step 2: Look for obvious conflicts\n\nSince there are no flags, there are no conflicts to resolve at this stage.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\n\nThere are 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining. This means we need to place all 10 flags correctly to mark all the bombs.\n\n### Step 4: Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile\n\nNow, I'll look for squares that must be bombs based on the numbers revealed.\n\n#### Analyzing the board:\n\n- **Position (0,8):** Shows '1'.

Therefore, all other adjacent tiles to (0,8) are safe.\n\n### Step 2: Look for obvious conflicts\n\nNext, I'll scan the board for any numbers that might have conflicting flags.\n\n- **Tile (1,8):** Shows '1'. Adjacent tiles are (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). There is a flag at (0,9), so this '1' indicates that there are no other bombs adjacent to (1,8).

Therefore, all other adjacent tiles to (1,9) are safe.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\n\nThere are 10 bombs in total, and 1 flag has already been placed. This means there are 9 bombs left to flag.\n\n### Step 4: Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile\n\nNow, I'll look for tiles that can be safely revealed or flagged based on the numbers.\n\n- **Tile (2,3):** Shows '1'. Adjacent tiles are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). All these tiles are unexplored ('.'). Since the number is '1', there is exactly one bomb among these adjacent tiles.\n\n- **Tile (3,6):** Shows '1'. Adjacent tiles are (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). All these tiles are unexplored ('.'). Since the number is '1', there is exactly one bomb among these adjacent tiles.\n\n- **Tile (4,6):** Shows '2'. Adjacent tiles are (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). All these tiles are unexplored ('.'). Since the number is '2', there are exactly two bombs among these adjacent tiles.\n\nGiven that there are multiple unexplored tiles adjacent to these numbers, it's safer to reveal a tile that is guaranteed to be safe based on the existing numbers and flags.\n\nLooking back at **Tile (0,8)**, which shows '1' and has a flag at (0,9), all other adjacent tiles to (0,8) are safe. The adjacent tiles to (0,8) are (0,7), (1,7), and (1,8). \n\n- **Tile (0,7):** Unexplored ('.'). Since (0,8) shows '1' and there's already a flag at (0,9), (0,7) must be safe.\n\nTherefore, I will reveal **Tile (0,7)**.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (0,8) shows '1' and has a flag at (0,9), so all other adjacent tiles to (0,8) are safe. Tile (0,7) is adjacent to (0,8) and unexplored, so it is safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n2 _ _ 1 . 1 1 1 1 _ _\n3 _ _ 1 1 1 1 . 1 _ _\n4 _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1 _ _\n5 1 2 2 3 . 1 _ _ _ _\n6 . . . . . 1 _ 1 1 1\n7 . . . . . 1 1 2 . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
