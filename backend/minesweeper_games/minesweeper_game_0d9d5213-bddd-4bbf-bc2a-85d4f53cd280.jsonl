{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "### **Understanding the Board**\n\nFirst, I took a moment to familiarize myself with the current state of the board. The board is a 10x10 grid, with the following relevant information:\n\n- **Revealed Numbers:**\n  - (4,4): 1\n  - (4,5): 1\n  - (4,6): 2\n  - (5,4): 1\n  - (5,5): 1\n  - (6,4): 1\n  - (6,5): 1\n  - (6,6): 1\n\n- **Flagged Space:**\n  - (3,6): F\n\n- **Remaining Flags:** 9\n- **Total Bombs:** 10\n\n### **Analyzing the Flagged Space at (3,6)**\n\nThe only flag currently placed is at (3,6). My first step was to examine how this flag interacts with the adjacent revealed numbers.\n\n1. **Adjacent to (4,6):** The tile at (4,6) shows a '2'. Since (3,6) is already flagged as a bomb, there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to (4,6).\n\n### **Identifying Potential Bomb Locations Around (4,6)**\n\nThe adjacent tiles to (4,6) are:\n\n- (3,5)\n- (3,6)\n- (3,7)\n- (4,5)\n- (4,7)\n- (5,5)\n- (5,6)\n- (5,7)\n\nFrom these, (3,6) is already flagged, so we need to find one more bomb among the remaining seven tiles.\n\n### **Examining the Number at (4,5):**\n\nThe tile at (4,5) shows a '1'. Let's see which tiles are adjacent to it:\n\n- (3,4)\n- (3,5)\n- (3,6)\n- (4,4)\n- (4,6)\n- (5,4)\n- (5,5)\n- (5,6)\n\nAmong these, (3,6) is flagged. Since (4,5) shows a '1', and one bomb is already accounted for at (3,6), there should be no other bombs adjacent to (4,5). This means we can safely reveal the other adjacent tiles.\n\n### **Revealing Safe Tiles Adjacent to (4,5):**\n\nGiven that (3,6) is flagged, and (4,5) shows '1', the tiles at (3,4), (3,5), (3,7), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), and (5,6) should be safe to reveal, except for the already revealed ones.\n\nHowever, some of these tiles might already be revealed, so let's check:\n\n- (4,4): Already revealed as '1'\n- (4,6): Already revealed as '2'\n- (5,4): Already revealed as '1'\n- (5,5): Already revealed as '1'\n\nSo, the remaining tiles to consider are (3,4), (3,5), (3,7), and (5,6).\n\n### **Deciding on the Next Move**\n\nGiven that (4,5) shows '1' and (3,6) is flagged, the tiles (3,4), (3,5), (3,7), and (5,6) are safe to reveal. Revealing any of these would help progress the game by eliminating potential bomb locations and uncovering more numbers.\n\nLooking at these options:\n\n- **(3,4):** Unexplored.\n- **(3,5):** Unexplored.\n- **(3,7):** Unexplored.\n- **(5,6):** Unexplored.\n\nAny of these would be a good choice for the next move. For simplicity, I'll choose the first one in the list: (3,4).\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The tile at (4,5) shows a '1' and has one adjacent flag at (3,6), meaning there are no other bombs adjacent to it. Therefore, the unexplored tile at (3,4) is safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 3,4,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . .

Let's examine its surroundings.\n\n```\nAdjacent tiles:\n(0,1): Unexplored (.)\n(0,2): '1'\n(0,3): Empty (_)\n(1,1): Unexplored (.)\n(1,3): '1'\n(2,1): Unexplored (.)\n(2,2): Unexplored (.)\n(2,3): Unexplored (.)\n```\n\nWe already have one bomb adjacent to (0,2), so there must be one more bomb among the unexplored tiles adjacent to (1,2).\n\n### Identifying Potential Bombs\n\nLooking at (0,1) and (1,1) for the bomb adjacent to (0,2):\n\n- If (0,1) is a bomb, then (1,1) is safe.\n- If (1,1) is a bomb, then (0,1) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,2):\n\n- We already have one bomb adjacent to (0,2), so we need one more bomb among (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n\n### Making an Informed Move\n\nGiven that we have limited information, it's safer to reveal a tile that has a lower chance of being a bomb.
