I'll choose a central coordinate with a low-risk strategy of revealing a square.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nReasoning:\n- (4,4) is near the center of the 10x10 board\n- Mathematically, this gives the highest chance of revealing an empty square or a low-number square\n- Choosing a central square reduces the risk of immediately hitting a bomb\n- This will help us gain initial information about the board's bomb distribution\n\nI'll await the result of this reveal to make my next strategic decision based on the new information revealed.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
