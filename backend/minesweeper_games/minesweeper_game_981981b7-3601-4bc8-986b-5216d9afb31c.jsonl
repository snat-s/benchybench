{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "### Understanding the Board\n\nFirst, I carefully examined the current state of the Minesweeper board. The entire board is unexplored, marked with dots (`.`), meaning no tiles have been revealed yet. With a board size of 10x10 and 10 bombs hidden, the game requires strategic moves to uncover safe tiles and identify bomb locations efficiently.\n\n### Initial Strategy\n\nGiven that the board is entirely unexplored, my first move should aim to maximize the information gained with minimal risk. The standard approach in Minesweeper is to start by revealing a corner or edge tile, as these have fewer adjacent tiles, reducing the complexity of subsequent decisions.\n\n### Choosing the Starting Tile\n\nI decided to start with the top-left corner at position (0,0). Revealing this tile would provide information about its adjacent tiles, which are fewer in number compared to a central tile. This choice minimizes the initial risk and sets a foundation for further exploration.\n\n### Anticipating the Outcome\n\nUpon revealing (0,0), there are three possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Bomb (`*`)**: If the tile is a bomb, the game ends immediately. However, since the first move has a low probability of being a bomb (only 10 bombs in 100 tiles), the risk is acceptable.\n\n2. **Empty Tile (`_`)**: If the tile is safe and doesn't border any bombs, it will be marked as empty, and all adjacent tiles can be revealed automatically.\n\n3. **Numbered Tile (1-8)**: If the tile borders one or more bombs, a number will appear indicating how many bombs are adjacent. This information is crucial for deducing bomb locations in the surrounding tiles.\n\n### Making the Move\n\nGiven the low risk and high potential reward of revealing (0,0), I proceeded with this move.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Starting with a corner tile maximizes the information gained with minimal risk. Revealing (0,0) provides initial data about adjacent tiles, which is essential for subsequent decisions.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,0,false\n\n### Next Steps\n\nAfter making the initial move, I would observe the outcome and adjust my strategy based on whether the tile was a bomb, empty, or numbered. If it's a bomb, the game ends; if it's empty, I can safely reveal adjacent tiles; if it's numbered, I can use that information to deduce bomb locations and make informed subsequent moves.\n\n---\n\nBy starting with a strategic first move, I set the stage for a systematic and informed progression through the Minesweeper game, minimizing risks and maximizing the chances of successfully identifying all bomb locations.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,1)\n- (1,0)\n- (1,1)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (0,1): Revealed as '2'\n- (1,0): Unexplored (`.`\n- (1,1): Revealed as '3'\n\nSince (0,1) and (1,1) are already revealed and contain numbers, the only possible bomb adjacent to (0,0) is at (1,0).\n\n#### Number '2' at (0,1)\n\nThe number '2' at (0,1) indicates two bombs in the adjacent squares. Adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,0): Revealed as '1'\n- (0,2): Unexplored\n- (1,0): Unexplored\n- (1,1): Revealed as '3'\n- (1,2): Unexplored\n\nFrom (0,0), we've already deduced that there's a bomb at (1,0). Therefore, the second bomb adjacent to (0,1) must be either at (0,2) or (1,2).\n\n#### Number '3' at (1,1)\n\nThe number '3' at (1,1) means three bombs in the adjacent squares. Adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,0): Revealed as '1'\n- (0,1): Revealed as '2'\n- (0,2): Unexplored\n- (1,0): Unexplored\n- (1,2): Unexplored\n- (2,0): Unexplored\n- (2,1): Unexplored\n- (2,2): Unexplored\n\nFrom (0,0) and (0,1), we've identified bombs at (1,0) and potentially at (0,2) or (1,2). However, to satisfy the '3' at (1,1), there must be a third bomb among the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n### Determining Bomb Locations\n\nLet's consolidate our findings:\n\n1. **Bomb at (1,0):** Confirmed due to the '1' at (0,0).\n2. **Bombs adjacent to (0,1):** One at (1,0) and another at either (0,2) or (1,2).\n3. **Bombs adjacent to (1,1):** Needs three bombs. We have one at (1,0) and potentially two more among (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nGiven that there are a total of 10 bombs on the board, and we've identified only one confirmed bomb so far, we need to proceed carefully.\n\n### Potential Moves\n\nBased on the above analysis, here are the potential moves:\n\n1. **Flagging (1,0):** Since we're confident there's a bomb here, we can place a flag.\n2. **Exploring (1,0):** However, since we're certain it's a bomb, revealing it would end the game, so we should avoid this.\n3. **Exploring (0,2) or (1,2):** To determine where the second bomb adjacent to (0,1) is located.\n4. **Exploring (2,0), (2,1), (2,2):** To find the third bomb adjacent to (1,1).\n\nGiven that flagging is our primary tool for marking bombs, and we have only 10 flags remaining, we should prioritize flagging confirmed bomb locations.\n\n### Deciding the Next Move\n\nConsidering the above, the most logical next step is to flag the confirmed bomb at (1,0). This will:\n\n- Mark a known bomb, reducing the remaining bomb count.\n- Allow us to focus on other potential bomb locations.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The number '1' at (0,0) indicates that there is exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. By analyzing the adjacent squares, the only possible bomb location is at (1,0). Therefore, we should place a flag at (1,0) to mark this confirmed bomb.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,0,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n1 . 3 . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Therefore, the cell at (1,1) (adjacent to (0,0)) cannot be a bomb and should be safe to reveal.\n\n**2.

Since (1,1) shows '3', there must be one more bomb in the adjacent unexplored cells: (0,2), (2,0), (2,1), or (2,2).\n\nHowever, from our previous analysis, (0,2) is safe to reveal. Therefore, the remaining potential bomb locations are (2,0), (2,1), or (2,2). Since we need to place a flag to indicate a bomb, we should look for confirmation from surrounding numbers.\n\n**4.
