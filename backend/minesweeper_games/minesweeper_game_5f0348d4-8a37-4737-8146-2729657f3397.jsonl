{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "EXPLANATION: The current state of the board shows several revealed numbers, but no obvious conflicts between these numbers and potential flag placements are immediately visible. Given the rules and the state of the board, the best next step is to reveal a tile that could provide more information about the board's state without immediately risking revealing a bomb. Looking at the board, revealing a tile adjacent to a revealed number could provide useful insights, especially if it's near a tile with a low number, as this could help determine the location of bombs more accurately.\n\nConsidering the revealed numbers, especially the ones with lower values like '1', revealing a tile next to one of these could be beneficial. For instance, the tile at position (5,3) with the value '2' is surrounded by several unrevealed tiles, and revealing one of these could help clarify the positions of bombs relative to this tile. However, without a clear indication of which tile to reveal for maximum information gain, a strategic choice would be to reveal a tile that is likely to have a low number of adjacent bombs or could potentially reveal a bomb-free area, thus providing more information about the board's state.\n\nMOVE: 4,5,false \n\nThis move chooses to reveal the tile at position (4,5), which is adjacent to the revealed '1' at (4,6). This choice is based on the strategy of revealing tiles that are likely to provide the most information about the board's state while minimizing the risk of immediately revealing a bomb. Revealing this tile could help determine the distribution of bombs around the already revealed numbers, potentially creating a clearer path for future moves.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . 1 . . .\n5 . . . . 2 2 1 1 1 1\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _\n8 . . . . 2 1 1 . 1 _\n9 . . . . . . . . 1 _", "sucess": false}
