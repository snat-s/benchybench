{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the game info.\n\nFirst, the board is a 10x10 grid, completely unexplored because all the squares are marked with a dot (.), which means they're unexplored. The game info tells me that there are 10 bombs placed on the board, and I have 10 flags remaining. Since I haven't placed any flags yet, that means I can potentially flag all the bombs without exceeding the limit.\n\nNow, the rules mention that the goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. Since the board is completely unexplored, my options are to start by either revealing a square or placing a flag. But given that I don't have any information yet, placing a flag might be risky because I don't know where the bombs are. Revealing a square seems safer because if I hit a bomb, the game ends, but if I don't, I get information that could help me deduce where the bombs are.\n\nLooking at the critical flag placement rules, each number on the board indicates exactly how many bombs are adjacent. Since no squares have been revealed yet, I don't have any numbers to go by. Therefore, placing a flag without any information could lead to conflicts later on if the numbers don't match up with the flags I've placed.\n\nConsidering the analysis steps, the first step is to check all revealed numbers against existing flags, but since nothing is revealed, that step doesn't apply yet. The second step is to look for obvious conflicts, but again, without any flags placed, there are no conflicts to check. The third step is to consider the remaining flags versus bombs. I have 10 flags and 10 bombs, so it's a one-to-one ratio. That means every flag I place should correspond to exactly one bomb, and I can't afford to place a flag where there isn't a bomb because that would leave a bomb unflagged.\n\nGiven that, my best move is to start by revealing a square to get some information. Revealing a square could either show me a number, which will help me figure out where the bombs are, or it could reveal a bomb, which would end the game. But since I don't have any information yet, it's the only way to proceed without blindly placing flags.\n\nI should probably start by revealing a square in the middle of the board to maximize the information I get. Revealing a corner might only give me information about a few surrounding squares, but a central square could potentially give me a number that affects more squares around it. So, maybe I'll choose a square like (5,5), which is in the middle of the board.\n\nWait, but maybe starting in the middle could be risky because if there's a bomb there, the game ends. Alternatively, maybe I should start near the edge where there are fewer adjacent squares, so if I do hit a bomb, it's less likely to be adjacent to other potential bombs. Hmm, but actually, the edges have fewer squares around them, so if I reveal a number there, it might give me less information than a central square.\n\nAlternatively, I could start by revealing a square that's not too central but still gives me a decent amount of information. Maybe something like (3,3) or (4,5). But since all squares are equal at this point, it might not matter much. I'll just pick a square that's somewhat central to get the most information possible.\n\nWait, but since the board is 10x10, the exact center would be around (5,5) because 10 divided by 2 is 5. So, let's go with (5,5). If I reveal that, and it's a number, I can start deducing from there. If it's a bomb, well, the game ends, but that's the risk I have to take.\n\nSo, my next move is to reveal the square at (5,5). I'm choosing this because it's central and will likely give me the most information about the surrounding area if it's a number. If it's a bomb, then I lose, but since I don't have any other information, it's a necessary risk.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: I chose to reveal the central square (5,5) to gain the most information about the surrounding area, which will help in deducing the locations of the bombs. Revealing this square is a strategic move to maximize the information obtained, which is crucial since the board is entirely unexplored.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 0, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the game info to understand the situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 10 flags remaining, which means I can flag all the bombs if I can correctly identify them. But I have to be careful because if I reveal a bomb, the game ends.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares are already revealed, either as empty (denoted by _) or numbered. The numbered squares indicate how many bombs are adjacent to them. My goal is to either reveal all the safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs.\n\nI should start by checking the revealed numbers to see if any of them have adjacent flags that might conflict. For example, if a square shows '1' and there's already a flag next to it, there can't be another bomb adjacent to it. Similarly, if a square shows '2' and only one flag is adjacent, there must be another bomb nearby.\n\nLet me go through the board step by step.\n\nStarting from the top-left corner, row 0, column 8 is revealed as 1. That means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares. The squares around (0,8) would be (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). Wait, (0,9) is a '.', so it's unexplored. (1,7) is 1, (1,8) is 1, (1,9) is '.', so maybe the bomb is in (0,9) or (1,9). But I'm not sure yet.\n\nMoving to row 1, column 0 is 1, column 1 is 1, column 2 is 2, column 3 is 1, column 4 is 1, column 7 is 1, column 8 is 1, and column 9 is '.'. So row 1 has several numbers. Let's look at (1,2) which is 2. The adjacent squares would include (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). From the board, (0,1) is 1, (0,2) is _, (0,3) is _, (1,1) is 1, (1,3) is 1, (2,1) is _, (2,2) is _, (2,3) is 2. So maybe the two bombs are in some of these squares. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4 is 1, column 7 is 1, column 8 is 2, column 9 is '.'. So (2,8) is 2, meaning two bombs are adjacent. The adjacent squares would be (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). From the board, (1,7) is 1, (1,8) is 1, (1,9) is '.', (2,7) is 1, (2,9) is '.', (3,7) is 1, (3,8) is 1, (3,9) is '.'. So there are several 1s around, but I'm not sure where the two bombs are.\n\nRow 3 has column 0 as 1, column 1 as 2, column 3 as 2, column 4 as 1, column 8 as 1, column 9 as '.'. So (3,1) is 2, meaning two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares would include (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). From the board, (2,0) is _, (2,1) is _, (2,2) is _, (3,0) is 1, (3,2) is _, (4,0) is _, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is '.'. Not sure about the bombs here.\n\nRow 4 has column 1 as 1, column 3 as 1, column 7 as 1, column 8 as 2. So (4,8) is 2, meaning two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares would be (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). From the board, (3,7) is 1, (3,8) is 1, (3,9) is '.', (4,7) is 1, (4,9) is '.', (5,7) is 1, (5,8) is 2, (5,9) is '.'. So possible bombs could be around here, but not sure.\n\nRow 5 has column 1 as 1, column 2 as 1, column 3 as 1, column 5 as 1, column 7 as 1, column 8 as 2. So (5,8) is 2, meaning two bombs nearby. The adjacent squares would include (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). From the board, (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is 2, (4,9) is '.', (5,7) is 1, (5,9) is '.', (6,7) is '.', (6,8) is '.', (6,9) is '.'.\n\nRow 6 has column 5 as 1, and the rest are '.' except for (6,0) to (6,4) which are '.' as well.\n\nRow 7 has column 1 as 2, column 2 as 2, column 3 as 2, column 4 as 1, column 5 as 1. So (7,1) is 2, (7,2) is 2, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is 1, (7,5) is 1.\n\nRow 8 has column 1 as 1, and the rest are '.'.\n\nRow 9 has column 1 as 1, and the rest are '.'.\n\nNow, considering the critical flag placement rules. Each number must have exactly the number of adjacent bombs as indicated. So, for example, any square with a 1 must have exactly one bomb in the surrounding 8 squares.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0 is 1. The adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). From the board, (0,0) is _, (0,1) is 1, (1,1) is 1, (2,0) is _, (2,1) is _. So this 1 in (1,0) must have exactly one bomb in these squares. Since (0,1) is 1, which is a number, not a flag, so the bomb could be in (0,0) or (2,0) or (2,1). But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is 2, so two bombs around it. The adjacent squares are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). From the board, (0,1) is 1, (0,2) is _, (0,3) is _, (1,1) is 1, (1,3) is 1, (2,1) is _, (2,2) is _, (2,3) is 2. So possible bombs could be in (0,2), (0,3), (2,2), or (2,3). But (2,3) is 2, which is a number, so no bomb there. So maybe the bombs are in (0,2) and (0,3), but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 1 is 2. The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). From the board, (2,0) is _, (2,1) is _, (2,2) is _, (3,0) is 1, (3,2) is _, (4,0) is _, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is '.'. So the two bombs must be in these squares. Maybe (2,0) and (2,1) are bombs? Or perhaps (4,0) and (4,1). But (4,1) is 1, which is a number, so no bomb there. So maybe (2,0) and (2,1) are bombs.\n\nWait, but (3,0) is 1, which is adjacent to (2,0) and (4,0). If (2,0) is a bomb, then (3,0) would have one bomb, which is correct. Similarly, if (4,0) is a bomb, that would also satisfy (3,0)'s 1. But since (3,1) is 2, it needs two bombs around it. So if (2,0) is a bomb, that's one, and perhaps (2,1) is another, making the two bombs for (3,1). That would satisfy both (3,0) and (3,1). So maybe (2,0) and (2,1) are bombs.\n\nIf that's the case, then (2,0) and (2,1) are bombs. Let me check if that makes sense elsewhere. For example, (1,0) is 1, and if (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,0)'s 1 is satisfied because it's adjacent to (2,0). So that works.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) being a bomb would affect (1,1), which is 1. If (2,1) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s 1 is satisfied because it's adjacent to (2,1). So that also works.\n\nSo maybe I can flag (2,0) and (2,1) as bombs. But wait, I can't place flags yet because I'm not sure. I need to verify if placing a flag here would conflict with other numbers.\n\nIf I flag (2,0), then I have to check if any adjacent numbers would be affected. For example, (1,0) is 1, which would now have a flag adjacent, so it should have exactly one bomb. If (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,0)'s 1 is satisfied. Similarly, (3,0) is 1, which would have (2,0) as a bomb, satisfying its count.\n\nSimilarly, flagging (2,1) would affect (1,1), which is 1. If (2,1) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s count is satisfied.\n\nBut wait, I can't place flags yet because I don't have any flags on the board. The game info says flags remaining: 10, which means I can place up to 10 flags. So I can start placing flags where I think bombs are.\n\nBut before I do that, I should check if placing a flag would conflict with any numbers. For example, if I place a flag at (2,0), I need to make sure that all adjacent numbers are still satisfied.\n\nLooking at (2,0), the adjacent numbers are (1,0) which is 1, and (3,0) which is 1. If I flag (2,0), then both (1,0) and (3,0) would have their counts satisfied because each is adjacent to one bomb. So that seems okay.\n\nSimilarly, flagging (2,1) would affect (1,1) which is 1, and (3,1) which is 2. If (2,1) is a bomb, then (1,1) is satisfied, and (3,1) would have one bomb so far, needing another.\n\nBut wait, (3,1) is 2, so if (2,1) is a bomb, there needs to be another bomb adjacent to (3,1). The adjacent squares to (3,1) are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). We already have (2,0) and (2,1) as possible bombs. If (2,0) is a bomb, that's one, and (2,1) is another, so (3,1)'s 2 is satisfied. So that works.\n\nSo maybe I can place flags at (2,0) and (2,1). But I can only make one move at a time. So which one should I choose first?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for squares where the numbers give me more certain information. For example, a square with 1 that has only one possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is 1. The adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). From the board, (0,7) is 1, (0,9) is '.', (1,7) is 1, (1,8) is 1, (1,9) is '.'. So the bomb must be in one of these. But I can't tell exactly where yet.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 7 is 1. The adjacent squares are (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). From the board, (0,6) is _, (0,7) is 1, (0,8) is 1, (1,6) is _, (1,8) is 1, (2,6) is _, (2,7) is 1, (2,8) is 2. So the bomb adjacent to (1,7) must be in one of these. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a square where the number is 1 and it's adjacent to a flag, but that's not possible because there are no flags yet.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for a square where the number is 1 and it's adjacent to only one possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 8 is 2. The adjacent squares are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). From the board, (3,7) is 1, (3,8) is 1, (3,9) is '.', (4,7) is 1, (4,9) is '.', (5,7) is 1, (5,8) is 2, (5,9) is '.'.\n\nSo (4,8) is 2, meaning two bombs around it. Let's see if any of these are possible. Maybe (5,8) is 2, so it's a number, not a bomb. So the bombs must be in the other squares.\n\nBut without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, column 1 is 2. The adjacent squares are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). From the board, (6,0) is _, (6,1) is _, (6,2) is _, (7,0) is _, (7,2) is 2, (8,0) is _, (8,1) is 1, (8,2) is '.'.\n\nSo (7,1) is 2, meaning two bombs around it. Since (7,2) is 2, it's a number, so no bomb there. So the bombs must be in the other squares.\n\nBut again, not enough info.\n\nMaybe I should consider the remaining flags. I have 10 flags, and 10 bombs. So I can potentially flag all the bombs, but I need to be sure where they are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, which can help narrow down the bomb locations.\n\nFor example, looking at (2,3) which is 2. The adjacent squares are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). From the board, (1,2) is 2, (1,3) is 1, (1,4) is 1, (2,2) is _, (2,4) is 1, (3,2) is _, (3,3) is 2, (3,4) is 1.\n\nSo (2,3) is 2, meaning two bombs around it. The possible bombs could be in (1,2) which is 2 (a number, not a bomb), (1,3) is 1, (1,4) is 1, (2,2) is _, (2,4) is 1, (3,2) is _, (3,3) is 2, (3,4) is 1. So the bombs must be in (2,2) and (3,2) perhaps? Or maybe (3,3) is a number, so no bomb there.\n\nWait, (3,3) is 2, which is a number, so no bomb there. So the bombs must be in (2,2) and (3,2). If I can confirm that, then (2,3)'s count is satisfied.\n\nBut without revealing, I can't be sure. Maybe I can flag (2,2) and see, but that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is surrounded by numbers that can help me deduce a bomb's location.\n\nFor example, looking at (5,8) which is 2. The adjacent squares are (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). From the board, (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is 2, (4,9) is '.', (5,7) is 1, (5,9) is '.', (6,7) is '.', (6,8) is '.', (6,9) is '.'.\n\nSo (5,8) is 2, meaning two bombs around it. The possible bombs could be in (4,7) which is 1, so no. (4,8) is 2, so no. (4,9) is '.', (5,7) is 1, (5,9) is '.', (6,7) is '.', (6,8) is '.', (6,9) is '.'.\n\nSo the bombs must be in (4,9), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), or (6,9). But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that is a 1 and has only one possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 5 is 1. The adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). From the board, (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is _, (6,4) is _, (6,6) is _, (7,4) is 1, (7,5) is 1, (7,6) is '.'.\n\nSo (6,5) is 1, meaning one bomb around it. The possible bombs could be in (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). But (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (7,4) is 1, (7,5) is 1, which are all numbers, so the bomb must be in (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), or (7,6).\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider that I have 10 flags and 10 bombs. So if I can correctly identify 10 squares as bombs, I can win. But I need to be careful not to reveal a bomb by mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is a 1 and has only one possible bomb location based on adjacent numbers.\n\nWait, looking back at row 3, column 1 is 2. If I can find two bombs around it, that would help. Earlier, I thought (2,0) and (2,1) could be bombs, which would satisfy both (3,1)'s 2 and (3,0)'s 1.\n\nSo maybe I can flag (2,0) as a bomb. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nIf I place a flag at (2,0), then I have to make sure that all adjacent numbers are still satisfied.\n\n(2,0) is adjacent to (1,0) which is 1. So (1,0) would now have a flag, which counts as a bomb, satisfying its 1.\n\nAlso, (3,0) is 1, which would now have a bomb at (2,0), satisfying its 1.\n\nSo that seems okay.\n\nSimilarly, if I flag (2,1), then (1,1) is 1, which would have a bomb at (2,1), satisfying its 1. And (3,1) is 2, which would have one bomb so far, needing another.\n\nSo if I place a flag at (2,0), that seems safe. Let me consider that as my next move.\n\nBut wait, I can only place one flag at a time. So my next move would be to flag (2,0).\n\nBut before I do that, I should check if there are any other numbers that would be affected. For example, (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0), (3,0), and (2,1). So placing a flag at (2,0) would satisfy (1,0) and (3,0)'s counts.\n\nSo I think it's safe to place a flag at (2,0).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square instead. But since I have flags available, and I think (2,0) is a bomb, I can try flagging it.\n\nBut wait, the game info says flags remaining: 10, so I can place up to 10 flags. So I can start by placing one.\n\nSo my next move would be to place a flag at (2,0).\n\nBut wait, looking again, (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0) which is 1. If I flag (2,0), then (1,0)'s count is satisfied, which is good. Also, (3,0) is 1, which would also be satisfied by (2,0)'s bomb.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is a 1 and has only one possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5 is 1. The adjacent squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). From the board, (4,4) is _, (4,5) is _, (4,6) is _, (5,4) is 1, (5,6) is _, (6,4) is _, (6,5) is 1, (6,6) is '.'.\n\nSo (5,5) is 1, meaning one bomb around it. The possible bombs could be in (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6). But (5,4) is 1, which is a number, so no bomb there. Similarly, (6,5) is 1, which is a number, so no bomb there.\n\nSo the bomb must be in (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), or (6,4), (6,6). Not sure.\n\nI think the best move is to place a flag at (2,0) because it satisfies two 1s, (1,0) and (3,0), and doesn't conflict with any other numbers.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (2,0) because it satisfies the adjacent 1s at (1,0) and (3,0) without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nMOVE: 2,0,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 .\n3 1 2 . 2 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n7 _ 1 2 2 1 1 . . . .\n8 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n9 _ 1 . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Let me start by looking at the current board state and the game info. \n\nThe board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I've already placed some flags, and I have 9 flags remaining, which means I can still place one more flag if needed.

I need to use these numbers to deduce where the bombs might be. Also, there's a flag at position (2,0), which is marked as 'F'. I need to make sure that any flags I place don't conflict with the numbers on the board.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each revealed number and see if any of them are conflicting with existing flags or if they can help me determine where a bomb must be. \n\nStarting from the top, at (0,8) there's a 1. That means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares. Let me check the surrounding squares. To the left is (0,7), which is a 1, and (0,9) is a '.' which is unexplored. Below (0,8) is (1,8), which is a 1, and (2,8) is a 2. So, the 1 at (0,8) has a 1 below it. Since (0,8) is a 1, and (1,8) is also a 1, I need to see if there's a bomb adjacent to both. \n\nWait, maybe I should look elsewhere. Let's check row 1. At (1,0) there's a 1, (1,1) is 1, (1,2) is 2, (1,3) is 1, (1,4) is 1, (1,5) is 1, (1,6) is '.', (1,7) is '.', and (1,8) is 1. So, row 1 has several numbers. \n\nLooking at (1,2) which is a 2. It's surrounded by (0,1)=1, (0,2)='.', (1,1)=1, (1,3)=1, (2,1)='.', (2,2)='.', (2,3)='.'. So, the 2 at (1,2) has two bombs in its adjacent squares. Since (1,1) is a 1, and (1,3) is a 1, maybe each of them has a bomb adjacent, but not overlapping. \n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach. Let's look for numbers that have all their adjacent squares revealed except one, which would indicate where the bomb is. \n\nFor example, at (3,0) there's a 1. Its adjacent squares are (2,0)=F, (3,1)=2, (4,0)='.', (2,1)='.', (3,-1) is out of bounds. So, the 1 at (3,0) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0) is flagged, that's one bomb, so the other adjacent squares can't have any bombs. Therefore, (3,1) is a 2, which must have two bombs around it. But since (3,0) is a 1, and (2,0) is a flag, the other bombs adjacent to (3,1) must be somewhere else.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for a square where all possible bomb locations are accounted for, leaving one spot as the only possibility. Let's check (2,8) which is a 2. Its adjacent squares include (1,7)='.', (1,8)=1, (1,9)='.', (2,7)='.', (2,9)='.', (3,7)='.', (3,8)=1, (3,9)='.'. So, the 2 at (2,8) needs two bombs in these squares. The 1 at (1,8) and (3,8) each have their own counts, so maybe the bombs are at (1,7) and (3,7). But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: check if any of the revealed numbers have too many flags around them. For example, if a 1 has two flags adjacent, that's a conflict because it should only have one bomb. Let me look for that.\n\nLooking at (0,8)=1. Its adjacent squares include (0,7)=1, (1,8)=1, and (2,8)=2. So, no flags around it except maybe (0,9) which is '.', so no conflict there.\n\nAt (1,8)=1, its adjacent squares include (0,8)=1, (1,7)='.', (2,8)=2, (0,9)='.', (1,9)='.', (2,9)='.'. No flags here either.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the flag at (2,0). Let's see if that's causing any conflicts. The square (2,0) is flagged, so it's considered a bomb. Now, looking at the squares around it, like (1,0)=1, (3,0)=1, and (2,1)='.'.\n\nSo, (1,0)=1 must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0) is a flag, that's the one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares to (1,0) must be safe. So, (0,0)='.', (0,1)='.', (1,1)=1, (2,1)='.', and (0,-1) is out of bounds. So, (1,0)=1 is satisfied by the flag at (2,0), so that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, (3,0)=1 must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0) is a flag, that's the one bomb, so the other adjacent squares to (3,0) can't have any bombs. So, (4,0)='.' is safe, (3,1)=2 must have its two bombs elsewhere, not in (3,0) or (2,0). \n\nLooking at (3,1)=2, its adjacent squares are (2,0)=F, (2,1)='.', (2,2)='.', (3,0)=1, (3,2)='.', (4,0)='.', (4,1)='.', (4,2)='.'. Since (2,0) is a flag, that's one bomb, so the other bomb must be in one of the other adjacent squares. But (3,0)=1 is already satisfied by (2,0), so the other bomb for (3,1)=2 must be somewhere else. Maybe (2,1) or (4,1) or (3,2). Not sure yet.\n\nLet me check another area. At (4,8)=2. Its adjacent squares include (3,7)='.', (3,8)=1, (3,9)='.', (4,7)='.', (4,9)='.', (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)='.'. So, the 2 at (4,8) needs two bombs around it. The 1 at (3,8) and the 2 at (5,8) might help. Maybe the bombs are at (5,7) and (5,9), but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a square that's a 1 and has only one possible spot for a bomb. For example, at (5,7)=1. Its adjacent squares are (4,6)='.', (4,7)='.', (4,8)=2, (5,6)=1, (5,8)=2, (6,6)='.', (6,7)='.', (6,8)='.'. So, the 1 at (5,7) must have one bomb adjacent. Since (5,8)=2 is a number, which needs two bombs, maybe the bomb for (5,7) is at (5,8), but that can't be because (5,8) is a number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (6,5)=1. Its adjacent squares include (5,4)='.', (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (6,4)='.', (6,6)='.', (7,4)=2, (7,5)=1, (7,6)=1. So, the 1 at (6,5) must have one bomb in these squares. But since (7,4)=2, (7,5)=1, and (7,6)=1, maybe the bomb is at (7,5) or (7,6). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the flag count. There are 10 bombs and I've already placed one flag at (2,0), so I have 9 flags left. But I don't know how many bombs are left to flag. Maybe I should focus on revealing squares that can give me more information.\n\nLooking at (0,0), it's '.', so unexplored. Revealing it might show a number or a bomb. But if I reveal it and it's a bomb, the game ends. So maybe that's too risky. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a square that's forced to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nWait, looking at (2,0)=F. The squares around it must have their numbers satisfied. For example, (1,0)=1 is satisfied by (2,0). So, the other adjacent squares to (1,0) can't have bombs. So, (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) can't have bombs because (1,0)=1 is already satisfied by (2,0). \n\nSimilarly, (3,0)=1 is also satisfied by (2,0), so its other adjacent squares can't have bombs. So, (4,0), (3,1), and (2,1) can't have bombs. Therefore, (3,1)=2 must have its two bombs in other places. Since (3,1) is a 2, and (2,0) is a flag, the other bomb must be somewhere else around (3,1). Let's see: adjacent squares are (2,0)=F, (2,1), (2,2), (3,0)=1, (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Since (3,0)=1 is already satisfied, the other bomb must be in (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), or (4,2). \n\nLooking at (3,1)=2, let's see if any of its adjacent squares are numbers. (4,1) is '.', (4,2) is '.', (2,1) is '.', (2,2) is '.', (3,2) is '.', so no numbers around it. Maybe I can't determine it yet.\n\nLet me look elsewhere. At (5,8)=2. Its adjacent squares include (4,7), (4,8)=2, (4,9), (5,7)=1, (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). The 2 at (5,8) needs two bombs around it. Since (5,7)=1, which needs one bomb, perhaps one bomb is at (5,9) and another at (6,8). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should check for any obvious conflicts. For example, if a number is showing a count that's already exceeded by the flags around it. Let's see.\n\nAt (1,2)=2, the adjacent squares include (0,1)=1, (0,2)='.', (1,1)=1, (1,3)=1, (2,1)='.', (2,2)='.', (2,3)='.'. So, the 2 at (1,2) needs two bombs. The 1s at (0,1), (1,1), and (1,3) each have their own counts, so maybe the bombs are at (0,2) and (2,2). But I can't be sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for a square that's a 1 and has only one possible bomb location. For example, (0,7)=1. Its adjacent squares are (0,6)='.', (0,8)=1, (1,6)='.', (1,7)='.', (-1,7) is out of bounds. So, the 1 at (0,7) must have one bomb in these squares. But since (0,8)=1 is also a 1, maybe the bomb is at (1,7). But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each number must have exactly the number of bombs around it. So, if I can find a square that's a 1 and all its adjacent squares except one are revealed as safe, then the remaining square must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (5,7)=1. Its adjacent squares are (4,6)='.', (4,7)='.', (4,8)=2, (5,6)=1, (5,8)=2, (6,6)='.', (6,7)='.', (6,8)='.'. So, the 1 at (5,7) must have one bomb in these squares. Since (5,8)=2 is a number, it can't be a bomb, so maybe the bomb is at (4,7) or (6,7). But I can't tell for sure.\n\nI'm starting to think that maybe I should place a flag somewhere, but I need to make sure it doesn't conflict with the existing numbers. Let me see if any squares are forced to be bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at (2,8)=2. Its adjacent squares include (1,7)='.', (1,8)=1, (1,9)='.', (2,7)='.', (2,9)='.', (3,7)='.', (3,8)=1, (3,9)='.'. The 2 at (2,8) needs two bombs. The 1s at (1,8) and (3,8) each have their own bombs, so maybe the bombs for (2,8) are at (1,7) and (3,7). But I can't confirm that.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a square that's surrounded by numbers that can only be satisfied if it's a bomb. For example, if a square is adjacent to two 1s, and all other possible bomb locations are exhausted, then it must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (2,0)=F, which is already flagged. So, that's one bomb accounted for. The rest must be placed elsewhere.\n\nAnother idea: check the number of flags remaining versus the number of bombs left. There are 10 bombs, and I've placed 1 flag, so 9 bombs left, and I have 9 flags. So, I can still place all the remaining bombs as flags if needed, but I have to make sure they don't conflict with the numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to find a square that must be a bomb because all other possibilities are exhausted. Let me check (7,5)=1. Its adjacent squares are (6,4)='.', (6,5)='.', (6,6)='.', (7,4)=2, (7,6)=1, (8,4)='.', (8,5)='.', (8,6)='.'. So, the 1 at (7,5) must have one bomb in these squares. Since (7,6)=1 is a number, it can't be a bomb, so maybe the bomb is at (7,4)=2. But (7,4)=2 is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused again.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (7,6)=1. Its adjacent squares include (6,5)='.', (6,6)='.', (6,7)='.', (7,5)=1, (7,7)='.', (8,5)='.', (8,6)='.', (8,7)='.'. So, the 1 at (7,6) must have one bomb in these squares. Since (7,5)=1 is a number, maybe the bomb is at (8,6). But I can't be sure.\n\nI'm starting to think that maybe the best move is to place a flag where I'm certain there's a bomb based on the numbers. Let me see if any squares are definitely bombs.\n\nLooking at (1,8)=1. Its adjacent squares include (0,8)=1, (1,7)='.', (2,8)=2, (0,9)='.', (1,9)='.', (2,9)='.'. So, the 1 at (1,8) must have one bomb in these squares. Since (0,8)=1 and (2,8)=2 are numbers, the bomb must be at (1,7), (1,9), or (2,9). But I can't tell which one.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that (2,8)=2 needs two bombs. If (1,8)=1 has a bomb at (1,7), then (2,8)=2 would have one bomb at (1,7) and needs another. So, maybe the other bomb is at (2,7) or (3,8). But (3,8)=1 is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, maybe the other bomb is at (2,7). But I can't confirm.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to reveal a square that's likely to be safe. Let's look at (0,0). It's unexplored, and if I reveal it, it might show a number or be safe. But if it's a bomb, I lose. Alternatively, I can look for a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, making it more likely to be safe.\n\nLooking at (2,1). It's adjacent to (1,0)=1, (1,1)=1, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=F, (2,2), (3,0)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,2). Since (1,0)=1 is satisfied by (2,0), and (3,0)=1 is also satisfied by (2,0), (2,1) can't be a bomb because (1,1)=1 would have its count satisfied by (2,1), but (1,1)=1 only needs one bomb, which could be (2,1). Wait, no, because (1,1)=1 is adjacent to (1,0)=1, (1,2)=2, (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (2,0)=F, (2,1), (2,2). So, (1,1)=1 must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0)=F is a bomb, that's the one, so (1,1)=1 is satisfied, meaning (2,1) can't be a bomb. Therefore, (2,1) is safe. So, revealing (2,1) would be safe.\n\nBut wait, if (2,1) is safe, revealing it might show a number, which could help. Alternatively, since (3,1)=2 needs two bombs, and (2,0)=F is one, the other must be somewhere else around (3,1). But (2,1) can't be a bomb, so maybe the other bomb is at (3,2) or (4,1). \n\nSo, maybe revealing (2,1) is a good move because it's safe and will give me more information. Let me check again: (2,1) is adjacent to (1,1)=1, which is satisfied by (2,0)=F. Therefore, (2,1) can't be a bomb because (1,1)=1 only needs one bomb. So, revealing (2,1) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere else, but I'm not sure. Since I have 9 flags left and 9 bombs remaining, I could potentially flag all the remaining bombs, but I need to make sure each flag is correct.\n\nWait, another idea: look for a square that's a 1 and has only one possible bomb location. For example, (0,8)=1. Its adjacent squares are (0,7)=1, (1,8)=1, and (2,8)=2. So, the 1 at (0,8) must have one bomb in these squares. But since (1,8)=1 and (2,8)=2 are numbers, the bomb must be at (0,7)=1 or (0,9). But (0,7)=1 is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Therefore, the bomb must be at (0,9). So, (0,9) is a bomb. Therefore, I can place a flag there.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me confirm: (0,8)=1 must have one bomb adjacent. The possible squares are (0,7)=1, (1,8)=1, (2,8)=2, and (0,9). Since (0,7)=1 is a number, it can't be a bomb, so the bomb must be at (0,9). Therefore, placing a flag at (0,9) is correct.\n\nSo, my next move would be to place a flag at (0,9).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The square at (0,9) must be a bomb because the adjacent 1 at (0,8) requires exactly one bomb, and all other possible locations are either numbers or already flagged. Placing a flag here satisfies the count without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nMOVE: 0,9,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 .\n3 1 2 . 2 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n7 _ 1 2 2 1 1 . . . .\n8 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n9 _ 1 . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has already placed some flags, and there are 8 flags remaining. So, I need to be careful about placing flags correctly without conflicting with the numbers shown.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares are revealed with numbers, some are flagged (F), and others are still unexplored (.). My goal is to either reveal a safe square or place a flag where a bomb is likely, making sure it doesn't conflict with the numbers.\n\nI'll start by checking each revealed number to see if there are any obvious conflicts with the existing flags. For example, if a square shows '1' and there are already two flags adjacent to it, that's a problem because the number should only have one bomb nearby.\n\nLet me go row by row.\n\nRow 0: The revealed squares are at (0,8)=1 and (0,9)=F. So, position (0,8) has a 1, meaning there's exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares to (0,8) would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). But (0,9) is already flagged, so that's one bomb accounted for. Therefore, the other adjacent squares should not have any more bombs because the number is 1. So, (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) shouldn't have any bombs except the one at (0,9). But wait, (1,9) is a dot, so maybe it's safe, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nRow 1: The squares are (1,0)=1, (1,1)=1, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=.. So, let's look at (1,2)=2. It has two bombs adjacent. Let's check its neighbors. The adjacent squares would be (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Among these, (1,1) is 1, (1,3) is 1, (2,1) is F, so that's a flag. So, the two bombs must be somewhere in the remaining adjacent squares. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nRow 2: (2,0)=F, (2,4)=1, (2,7)=1, (2,8)=2, (2,9)=.. So, (2,8)=2. Its adjacent squares include (2,7)=1, (2,9), (1,7), (1,8)=1, (1,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). Since (2,8) is 2, there should be exactly two bombs adjacent. Looking at the flags, I don't see any around here except maybe elsewhere.\n\nRow 3: (3,0)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,8)=1. Let's check (3,1)=2. Its neighbors are (2,0)=F, (2,1), (3,0)=1, (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Since (2,0) is a flag, that's one bomb. So, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (3,1). So, the other bomb could be in (3,2), (4,1), or (4,2), etc.\n\nRow 4: (4,1)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=2. Let's look at (4,7)=2. Its neighbors include (4,6)=1, (4,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8)=1, (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). Since (4,6)=1, that's one bomb accounted for. So, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (4,7). So, maybe (5,7) or (3,7) or (4,8) could have a bomb.\n\nRow 5: (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=2. Looking at (5,7)=2. Its neighbors are (5,6)=1, (5,8), (4,6)=1, (4,7)=2, (4,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). Since (5,6)=1 and (4,6)=1, that's two bombs already, but (5,7) is 2, so that's a problem because it can't have more than two. Wait, no, the number indicates how many bombs are adjacent. So, if (5,7) is 2, and it's adjacent to (5,6)=1 and (4,6)=1, that would mean those two are bombs, which would make (5,7) have two bombs adjacent, which is correct. So, that's okay.\n\nRow 6: (6,5)=1. Its neighbors would be (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). Since (6,5)=1, there's exactly one bomb adjacent. So, maybe one of these is a bomb, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nRow 7: (7,1)=2, (7,2)=2, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=1. Let's check (7,1)=2. Its neighbors are (6,0), (6,1), (7,0), (7,2)=2, (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). So, two bombs adjacent. Since (7,2)=2, which is another number, perhaps there's a bomb in (6,1) or (8,1), etc.\n\nRow 8: (8,1)=1. Its neighbors are (7,0), (7,1)=2, (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). Since (8,1)=1, there's exactly one bomb adjacent. So, maybe (7,1) is a bomb, but (7,1) is 2, so that's a number, not a bomb. So, perhaps (9,1) is a bomb? Or (7,0) or (8,2), etc.\n\nRow 9: (9,1)=. So, nothing revealed yet.\n\nNow, let's think about the flags. The flags are at (0,9), (2,0), (3,0) is 1, so that's a number, not a flag. Wait, looking back, the board state shows:\n\nRow 0: ... F at (0,9)\nRow 2: F at (2,0)\nRow 3: (3,0)=1, so that's a number, not a flag. So, the flags are at (0,9) and (2,0). So, two flags placed so far, and the total bombs are 10, so 8 flags remaining. Wait, the game info says flags remaining: 8, bombs:10. So, the player can place 8 more flags, but there are 10 bombs, so they need to place all 10 flags correctly.\n\nWait, no. The total number of bombs is 10, so the player needs to place 10 flags. But the flags remaining are 8, meaning they've already placed 2 flags (since 10-8=2). Looking at the board, I see F at (0,9) and (2,0), so that's two flags. So, they have 8 more to place.\n\nNow, I need to look for squares where placing a flag makes sense without conflicting with the numbers.\n\nLet me check the numbers again for any conflicts.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,8)=1. It's adjacent to (0,9)=F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares must not have any bombs. So, (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) should be safe. So, if I can reveal any of these, it might help.\n\nLooking at row 1, (1,2)=2. Its adjacent squares include (1,1)=1, (1,3)=1, and (2,1)=F. So, since (2,1) is F, that's one bomb. So, the other bomb must be in one of the other adjacent squares. But (1,1)=1 and (1,3)=1, so those squares can only have one bomb each in their adjacent areas. So, the second bomb for (1,2)=2 must be somewhere else. Let's see, the adjacent squares are (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Among these, (2,1)=F, so that's one bomb. The other could be in (0,1), (0,2), (2,2), or (2,3). But (0,1) is 1, so if (0,1) is 1, it can only have one bomb adjacent. So, if (0,1) is a number, it's possible that (0,1) is safe, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, (0,1) is 1, so it has exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0)=1, (1,1)=1, (1,2)=2. So, (0,1) is 1, meaning only one bomb in these squares. So, if (0,1) is 1, and (1,0)=1, which is also a number, then perhaps the bomb is in (0,0) or (0,2). But (0,0) is a dot, so unexplored, and (0,2) is also a dot. So, maybe (0,0) or (0,2) is a bomb.\n\nBut going back to (1,2)=2, which needs two bombs adjacent. One is at (2,1)=F, so the other must be in the remaining adjacent squares. So, perhaps (0,2) is a bomb? If so, that would satisfy both (1,2)=2 and (0,1)=1, because (0,1) would have one bomb at (0,2). But I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (2,2) is a bomb. If (2,2) is a bomb, then (1,2)=2 would have two bombs: (2,1)=F and (2,2)=bomb. That would work. Also, (2,0)=F, so (2,0) is another bomb. So, that could be possible.\n\nWait, (2,0) is F, so that's a bomb. So, (2,0) is a bomb. Then, for (3,1)=2, which is adjacent to (2,0)=F, that's one bomb, so it needs another bomb adjacent. So, maybe (3,2) is a bomb, or (4,1), etc.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for squares where the numbers indicate that certain flags must be placed.\n\nAnother approach is to look for squares that are numbers and see if their adjacent flags plus potential bombs match the number.\n\nFor example, looking at (4,7)=2. Its adjacent squares include (4,6)=1, which is a number. So, (4,6)=1 means it has exactly one bomb adjacent. So, the bomb could be in (4,5), (3,5), (5,5), etc. But (4,7)=2 needs two bombs adjacent. Since (4,6)=1 is a number, it's already accounted for one bomb, so (4,7) needs one more bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nWait, no. The number (4,7)=2 indicates that there are two bombs in its adjacent eight squares. If (4,6)=1 is a number, it doesn't necessarily mean that (4,6) is a bomb, but that it's a square with a number indicating one bomb adjacent. So, (4,7)=2 must have two bombs in its adjacent squares, regardless of what (4,6) shows.\n\nSo, perhaps I should look for squares where placing a flag would satisfy the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 7, (7,1)=2 and (7,2)=2. Let's see their adjacent squares.\n\n(7,1)=2: adjacent squares are (6,0), (6,1), (7,0), (7,2)=2, (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). So, two bombs needed here.\n\n(7,2)=2: adjacent squares are (6,1), (6,2), (7,1)=2, (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). So, two bombs needed here.\n\nLooking at (8,1)=1. Its adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1)=2, (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). Since (8,1)=1, there's exactly one bomb adjacent. So, perhaps one of these is a bomb.\n\nIf I consider that (7,1)=2 and (7,2)=2, maybe (8,1) is a bomb. But (8,1)=1 is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Therefore, the bomb must be in one of the other adjacent squares.\n\nWait, no. (8,1)=1 is a number, so it's a safe square with one adjacent bomb. So, the bomb must be in one of its adjacent squares. So, perhaps (9,1) is a bomb. If I place a flag at (9,1), that would satisfy (8,1)=1. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf (9,1) is a bomb (flagged), then (8,1)=1 would have one bomb adjacent, which is correct. Also, (7,1)=2 would have one bomb at (9,1), so it needs another bomb adjacent. So, another bomb must be near (7,1). Similarly, (7,2)=2 would need two bombs, one of which could be (9,1) if it's adjacent, but (9,1) is not adjacent to (7,2). So, (7,2) would need two other bombs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (8,2) is a bomb. If (8,2) is a bomb, then (8,1)=1 would have one bomb, which is correct. Also, (7,1)=2 would have one bomb at (8,2), so it needs another bomb elsewhere. Similarly, (7,2)=2 would have one bomb at (8,2), so it needs another bomb.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look for a square where placing a flag would satisfy multiple numbers.\n\nLooking at (9,1), if I place a flag there, it would help (8,1)=1. Also, (9,1) is adjacent to (8,1)=1, which is correct. But does it affect any other numbers? Let's see.\n\n(9,1) is adjacent to (8,0), (8,1)=1, (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). So, if (9,1) is a bomb, then any numbers adjacent to it must account for it. For example, (9,0) is a dot, so if it's a number, it would have to include this bomb in its count. But since (9,0) is unexplored, I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (9,5) is a bomb. Let me check. (9,5) is adjacent to (8,4), (8,5), (9,4), (9,6). But I don't see any numbers around there, so it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: look for numbers that are 1, as they have exactly one bomb adjacent. If a 1 is adjacent to a flag, then the other adjacent squares must be safe.\n\nLooking at (0,8)=1, which is adjacent to (0,9)=F. So, the other adjacent squares must be safe. Therefore, (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) must be safe. So, I can safely reveal these if needed.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0)=1 is adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0)=F, (2,1). So, since (2,0)=F is a bomb, the other adjacent squares must be safe. So, (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) are safe. But (1,1)=1, which is a number, so that's okay.\n\nLooking at (1,3)=1. Its adjacent squares are (0,2), (0,3), (1,2)=2, (1,4)=1, (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)=1. Since (1,3)=1, there's exactly one bomb adjacent. So, the bomb could be in (0,2), (0,3), (2,2), or (2,3). But (1,2)=2 is a number, so it's possible that (2,2) is a bomb, which would satisfy both (1,3)=1 and (1,2)=2.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4)=1. Its adjacent squares include (0,3), (0,4), (1,3)=1, (1,5), (2,3), (2,4)=1, (2,5). So, one bomb here. Maybe (2,5) is a bomb, but (2,5) is a dot.\n\nAlternatively, (2,4)=1. Its adjacent squares include (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (2,3), (2,5), (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5). So, one bomb here. Maybe (3,3)=2 is a number, so it's possible that (3,5) is a bomb, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit overwhelming. Maybe I should look for a square where placing a flag would satisfy multiple numbers without causing conflicts.\n\nLooking back at (9,1), if I place a flag there, it would satisfy (8,1)=1. Also, (7,1)=2 would have one bomb at (9,1), so it needs another bomb adjacent. Similarly, (7,2)=2 would need two bombs, but (9,1) is not adjacent to (7,2), so it would need another bomb elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (8,2) is a bomb. If I place a flag at (8,2), it would satisfy (8,1)=1, as (8,2) is adjacent. Then, (7,1)=2 would have one bomb at (8,2), needing another. Also, (7,2)=2 would have one bomb at (8,2), needing another.\n\nBut I don't know if (8,2) is a bomb yet. It's a dot, so it's unexplored.\n\nAnother idea: look at (5,7)=2. Its adjacent squares include (5,6)=1 and (4,6)=1. So, those two are numbers, but they don't indicate bombs. Wait, no, (5,6)=1 means there's one bomb adjacent to it. So, perhaps (5,6) is a number, so it's safe, but it's adjacent to a bomb.\n\nWait, no. (5,6)=1 is a number, so it's a safe square with exactly one bomb adjacent. So, the bomb could be in (5,5), (5,7), (4,5), (4,6), (6,5), or (6,6). But (5,7)=2, which is a number, so it's a safe square with two bombs adjacent. So, the two bombs must be in its adjacent squares.\n\nBut (5,6)=1 is a number, so it's safe, and it has one bomb adjacent. So, perhaps the bomb is in (5,5) or (6,5). If (5,5)=1, that's a number, so it's safe, but it has one bomb adjacent. So, maybe (5,5) is a number, and the bomb is in (6,5). Let me check.\n\n(6,5)=1 is a number, so it's safe with one bomb adjacent. So, if (6,5)=1, the bomb could be in (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)=1, (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), or (7,6). But (5,6)=1 is already a number, so it's safe, so the bomb must be elsewhere.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should pick a square that is likely to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at (2,0)=F, which is a bomb. Its adjacent squares are (1,0)=1, (2,1), (3,0)=1, (3,1)=2. So, (1,0)=1 and (3,0)=1 have one bomb each, which is accounted for by (2,0)=F. So, that's okay.\n\nLooking at (3,1)=2. It's adjacent to (2,0)=F, so one bomb. It needs another bomb. The other adjacent squares are (3,0)=1, (3,2), (4,0), (4,1)=1, (4,2). Since (3,0)=1 and (4,1)=1, those are numbers, so the other bomb must be in (3,2) or (4,2). So, maybe (3,2) is a bomb. If I place a flag there, it would satisfy (3,1)=2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if (3,2) is a bomb. Alternatively, (4,2) could be a bomb, but I don't know yet.\n\nAnother approach: look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, making it a likely candidate for a bomb.\n\nFor example, (3,5) is adjacent to (3,4)=1, (4,4), (4,5), etc. But I don't see any numbers around it.\n\nWait, (4,7)=2. Its adjacent squares include (4,6)=1, which is a number. So, (4,6)=1 must have one bomb adjacent. So, the bomb could be in (4,5), (3,5), (5,5), (5,6), or (4,7)=2. But (4,7)=2 is a number, so it's safe. So, maybe (5,6)=1 is a number, so the bomb is in (5,5) or (5,7)=2. But (5,7)=2 is a number, so it's safe, so the bomb must be in (5,5). So, (5,5) could be a bomb. If I place a flag there, it would satisfy (4,6)=1 and (5,6)=1, as both would have one bomb adjacent.\n\nBut I'm not sure if (5,5) is a bomb. Let me check the adjacent numbers. (5,5)=1 is a number, so it's safe, but it has one bomb adjacent. So, if (5,5) is a number, it can't be a bomb. Wait, no, (5,5) is a dot, so it's unexplored. So, maybe (5,5) is a bomb.\n\nWait, no, (5,5)=1 is a number, so it's a safe square with one bomb adjacent. So, the bomb must be in one of its adjacent squares: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (6,4), (6,5)=1, (5,6)=1. So, (5,5)=1 is a number, so it's safe, and it has one bomb adjacent. So, the bomb could be in (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (6,4), (6,5)=1, or (5,6)=1. But (6,5)=1 and (5,6)=1 are numbers, so they are safe, so the bomb must be in (5,4), (4,4), or (4,5).\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and has no other numbers around it, making it a likely bomb.\n\nLooking at (0,0). It's adjacent to (0,1)=1 and (1,0)=1. Both are numbers, so (0,0) could be a bomb because it's adjacent to two 1s. But wait, (0,1)=1 has one bomb adjacent, which could be (0,0) or (0,2). Similarly, (1,0)=1 has one bomb adjacent, which could be (0,0) or (2,0)=F. Since (2,0)=F is a bomb, (1,0)=1 is satisfied by that. So, (0,0) could be a bomb, making (0,1)=1 have one bomb at (0,0), and (1,0)=1 have one bomb at (2,0). That would work.\n\nSo, if I place a flag at (0,0), it would satisfy both (0,1)=1 and (1,0)=1. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nBut wait, (0,0) is a dot, so it's unexplored. If I place a flag there, I need to make sure it doesn't conflict with any numbers. Since (0,1)=1 would have one bomb at (0,0), and (1,0)=1 would have one bomb at (2,0), that works. So, placing a flag at (0,0) seems like a good move because it satisfies both numbers without causing any conflicts.\n\nAlternatively, I could reveal (0,0) to see if it's a bomb, but that's risky because if it's a bomb, the game ends. Since I have flags remaining, it's safer to place a flag there if I'm confident.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if (0,0) is a bomb. It could also be that (0,2) is a bomb, making (0,1)=1 have one bomb at (0,2), and (1,0)=1 have one bomb at (2,0). So, I'm not certain.\n\nAnother option is to reveal a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, giving more information.\n\nFor example, (1,2)=2 is adjacent to (1,1)=1 and (1,3)=1. If I reveal (1,2), but it's a number, so it's safe. Wait, (1,2) is already a number, it's 2, so it's safe. So, revealing it doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (0,7), which is adjacent to (0,8)=1. Since (0,8)=1 has one bomb at (0,9)=F, (0,7) must be safe. So, revealing (0,7) would confirm it's safe and might give more numbers.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, placing a flag at (0,0) seems plausible.\n\nWait, another thought: the total number of bombs is 10, and we've already placed two flags. So, we need to place 8 more. But I don't want to place a flag without being sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 2 and see if placing a flag there would satisfy the count.\n\nLooking at (2,8)=2. Its adjacent squares include (2,7)=1, (2,9), (1,7), (1,8)=1, (1,9), (3,7), (3,8)=1, (3,9). Since (2,8)=2 needs two bombs, and (2,7)=1 is a number, it must have one bomb adjacent. So, perhaps (3,8)=1 is a number, so it's safe, and it has one bomb adjacent. So, the two bombs for (2,8)=2 must be in its adjacent squares. Maybe (3,7) and (3,9) are bombs. But I don't know.\n\nThis is really tricky. I think I'll go with placing a flag at (0,0) because it satisfies both (0,1)=1 and (1,0)=1, and it doesn't conflict with any other numbers that I can see.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (0,0) satisfies the adjacent '1's at (0,1) and (1,0) without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,true", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the current board state to understand where the numbers and flags are. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 7 flags remaining, which means I can place 7 more flags if needed.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice that some squares are already revealed with numbers, and some are flagged with 'F'. My goal is to either reveal a tile or place/remove a flag without hitting a bomb. Since the game ends if I reveal a bomb, I need to be careful.\n\nI'll start by checking each revealed number to see if there are any conflicts with existing flags. For example, if a square shows '1' and has two adjacent flags, that's a conflict because the number indicates exactly one bomb nearby. Similarly, if a '2' has only one flag adjacent, there must be another bomb nearby.\n\nLet me go row by row.\n\nRow 0:\n- (0,0): F (flagged)\n- (0,8): 1\n- (0,9): F (flagged)\n\nSo, in row 0, there are two flags and a '1' at (0,8). The '1' at (0,8) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Let's see its neighbors. The adjacent squares are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). Among these, (0,7) is revealed as '_', which means it's empty. (1,7) and (1,8) are also '_', so the only possible bomb adjacent to (0,8) is (1,9), which is '.' (unexplored). So, that seems okay.\n\nRow 1:\n- (1,0): 1\n- (1,1): 1\n- (1,2): 2\n- (1,8): 1\n- (1,9): '.' \n\nLooking at (1,0): it's a '1'. Its neighbors are (0,0) which is F, (0,1) which is '_', (1,1) which is '1', and (2,0) which is 'F'. Wait, (2,0) is also F. So, the '1' at (1,0) has two flags adjacent. That's a problem because it can only have one bomb nearby. This suggests that either one of these flags is incorrect, or there's another bomb. But since the total bombs are 10, and we have 7 flags left, maybe there's an issue here.\n\nWait, but the '1' at (1,0) is indicating that exactly one bomb is adjacent. But it has two flags adjacent: (0,0) and (2,0). That's a conflict because it can't have two bombs. So, this indicates that either one of these flags is wrong, or there's a mistake in the board state. Maybe I should consider removing one of these flags.\n\nBut before that, let me check other rows for similar issues.\n\nRow 2:\n- (2,0): F\n- (2,4): 1\n- (2,7): 1\n- (2,8): 2\n- (2,9): '.' \n\nSo, (2,4) is '1', which has neighbors: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Not sure about the bombs here, but I don't see any immediate conflicts.\n\nRow 3:\n- (3,0): 1\n- (3,1): 2\n- (3,3): 2\n- (3,4): 1\n- (3,8): 1\n- (3,9): '.' \n\nLooking at (3,1): '2', so it needs two bombs adjacent. Its neighbors include (2,0) which is F, (2,1) which is '.', (2,2) which is '.', (3,0) which is '1', (3,2) which is '.', (4,0) which is '.', (4,1) which is '1', (4,2) which is '.'. So, it already has one flag at (2,0). So, it needs another bomb somewhere else nearby. Maybe (3,2) or (4,1) is another bomb? But (4,1) is '1', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, perhaps (3,2) is another bomb. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nRow 4:\n- (4,1): 1\n- (4,3): 1\n- (4,7): 1\n- (4,8): 2\n- (4,9): '.' \n\n(4,1) is '1', so it has one bomb nearby. Its neighbors: (3,0) which is '1', (3,1) which is '2', (3,2) which is '.', (4,0) which is '.', (4,2) which is '.', (5,0) which is '.', (5,1) which is '1', (5,2) which is '1'. So, no flags nearby except maybe (3,0) is '1' but that's a number, not a flag. So, perhaps the bomb is at (3,2) or (4,2).\n\nRow 5:\n- (5,1): 1\n- (5,2): 1\n- (5,5): 1\n- (5,6): 1\n- (5,7): 2\n- (5,8): '.' \n- (5,9): '.' \n\nLooking at (5,1): '1' with neighbors including (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,1) is '1', so no flags nearby except perhaps (6,1) which is '.'.\n\nRow 6:\n- (6,5): 1\n- (6,7): '.' \nOthers are '.'.\n\nRow 7:\n- (7,1): 2\n- (7,2): 2\n- (7,3): 2\n- (7,4): 1\n- (7,5): 1\n- (7,6): '.' \n- (7,7): '.' \n- (7,8): '.' \n- (7,9): '.' \n\nRow 8:\n- (8,1): 1\n- Others are '.'.\n\nRow 9:\n- (9,1): 1\n- Others are '.'.\n\nNow, going back to the issue in row 1. The '1' at (1,0) has two flags at (0,0) and (2,0). That's a conflict because it can't have two bombs adjacent. So, one of these flags must be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the '1' is wrong, but that's unlikely since it's a revealed number.\n\nSo, I have two options: either remove one of the flags or figure out which one is correct. But since I can't reveal any of these because they're flagged, maybe I should consider removing one. But which one?\n\nLooking at (0,0): it's a flag. If I remove it, I can place it elsewhere. But is (0,0) actually a bomb? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe (2,0) is the correct flag, and (0,0) is not a bomb. Or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '1' at (1,0) is correct, meaning that only one of (0,0) or (2,0) is a bomb. So, I might need to figure out which one is the actual bomb.\n\nLet me check the neighbors of (0,0). It's a flag, so if I remove it, I can see if it's a bomb or not. But if it's a bomb, the game ends. So, maybe that's too risky. Alternatively, I can check the neighbors of (2,0). If I remove the flag there, I can see.\n\nWait, but I can't reveal a flagged square unless I remove the flag. So, perhaps I should remove one of the flags and see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to determine which one is correct. Let me see.\n\nLooking at (2,0): it's a flag. Its neighbors include (1,0) which is '1', (1,1) which is '1', (2,1) which is '.', (3,0) which is '1', (3,1) which is '2'. So, (2,0) being a flag (bomb) would affect the numbers around it.\n\nIf (2,0) is a bomb, then the '1' at (1,0) would have one bomb, which is correct. But the '1' at (3,0) would also have one bomb, which is correct if (2,0) is the only bomb adjacent. Similarly, the '2' at (3,1) would have one bomb at (2,0), so it needs another bomb somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, if (0,0) is a bomb, then the '1' at (1,0) would have one bomb, which is correct. The '1' at (0,8) would have one bomb, but that's already accounted for at (1,9) perhaps.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for other clues elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 7, there are several numbers: (7,1):2, (7,2):2, (7,3):2, (7,4):1, (7,5):1. These numbers might help.\n\nFor example, (7,1):2. Its neighbors include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). Among these, (8,1) is '1', so it can't be a bomb. So, the two bombs must be among the other squares. But I don't see any flags here, so maybe it's safe to explore.\n\nWait, but I have to be careful. Maybe I should focus on areas where I can get more information.\n\nLooking back at row 1, the conflict at (1,0) is a problem. Maybe I should try to resolve that first. So, perhaps I can remove the flag at (0,0) or (2,0) to see if it's a bomb.\n\nBut if I remove the flag at (0,0), and it's a bomb, the game ends. So that's risky. Alternatively, I can try to remove the flag at (2,0). Let's see.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (2,0), what happens? Let's say I make a move to (2,0) with flag=true, which would remove the flag. But wait, the move format is x,y,flag. So, if I do (2,0,true), I'm placing a flag, but it's already flagged. So, to remove it, I should set flag=true again? Or is it that flag=true places a flag, and flag=false reveals it. Wait, the rules say that to remove a flag, you make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So, if I do (2,0,true), it would remove the flag.\n\nSo, perhaps I can try that. But I'm not sure if it's a bomb. Alternatively, maybe I can find another way.\n\nWait, let me think about the total number of bombs. There are 10 bombs in total. Let's count the flags: I see flags at (0,0), (0,9), (2,0). So that's 3 flags. But the user said flags remaining:7, so total flags placed so far are 3, meaning 7 more can be placed. Wait, no: the total bombs are 10, so the number of flags should equal the number of bombs. So, if there are 10 bombs, I can place up to 10 flags. But the flags remaining are 7, so I've already placed 3 flags. So, I can place 7 more.\n\nBut back to the conflict. The '1' at (1,0) can't have two bombs adjacent. So, one of the flags must be wrong. Therefore, either (0,0) or (2,0) is not a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '1' at (1,0) is correct, meaning only one of them is a bomb. So, I have to figure out which one.\n\nLet me check the neighbors of (0,0). If (0,0) is a bomb, then the square (0,1) is '_', which is empty, so it must have no bombs adjacent except (0,0). But (0,1) is '_', so it's safe. Wait, but (0,1) is next to (0,0), so if (0,0) is a bomb, (0,1) should be '1' because it's adjacent to a bomb. But (0,1) is '_', meaning it's empty, so it's safe. Therefore, (0,0) can't be a bomb because that would make (0,1) have a '1'. Therefore, (0,0) must not be a bomb, and the flag there is incorrect.\n\nSo, that means the flag at (0,0) is wrong, and (0,0) is actually safe. Therefore, I should remove that flag. Then, the '1' at (1,0) must have exactly one bomb adjacent, which would be (2,0). So, (2,0) must be a bomb.\n\nWait, but if (0,0) is not a bomb, then the '1' at (1,0) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0) is a flag, that's the bomb. So, the flag at (2,0) is correct.\n\nTherefore, I should remove the flag at (0,0). That would free up a flag spot, and I can place it elsewhere if needed.\n\nSo, my next move would be to remove the flag at (0,0). The move would be (0,0,true) because I'm placing a flag on an already flagged square, which removes it.\n\nBut wait, the move format is x,y,flag. So, to remove a flag, I set flag=true on an already flagged square. So, the move would be (0,0,true).\n\nAlternatively, if I set flag=false, that would reveal the square, but since it's already flagged, I can't reveal it without removing the flag first.\n\nSo, I think the correct move is to remove the flag at (0,0), which would be (0,0,true).\n\nAfter that, the '1' at (1,0) would correctly have one bomb at (2,0), resolving the conflict.\n\nSo, that's my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Removing the flag at (0,0) resolves the conflict with the '1' at (1,0), as (0,0) cannot be a bomb because it would incorrectly set (0,1) to '1'. Therefore, the bomb must be at (2,0), and (0,0) is safe.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,true", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 F _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 3, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the information given. \n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has already placed some flags, and there are 8 flags remaining. So, we have 8 more flags we can place if needed. \n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares are already revealed, and some are flagged. My goal is to either reveal a tile or place a flag without causing a conflict with the existing numbers. \n\nLet me go through the board step by step. Starting from the top, row 0 has a few revealed tiles. At (0,8), there's a '1', and at (0,9), it's flagged as 'F'. So, that '1' in (0,8) indicates there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). But (1,9) is a '.' which means it's unexplored, and (0,9) is flagged. Wait, if (0,8) is a '1' and (0,9) is flagged, that might mean that the bomb is either in (0,7), (1,7), or (1,8). But (1,8) is also a '1', so maybe that's a clue.\n\nWait, no, (1,8) is a '1' as well. So, maybe the bombs are placed in a way that satisfies both. Let me check the surrounding of (1,8). It's a '1', so it has one bomb around it. The adjacent squares would be (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). But (0,8) is a '1' and (0,9) is flagged, so maybe the bomb for (1,8) is in (1,7) or (2,7) or (2,8). \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me look for other numbers that might be easier. For example, in row 1, column 0 is a '1'. So, the square at (1,0) is '1', which means it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares would be (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). But (0,0) is '_', which is revealed as empty, so no bomb there. (0,1) is also '_', so empty. (1,1) is '1', so that's another number. Wait, so (1,0) is '1' and (1,1) is '1', so each of them must have exactly one bomb adjacent. \n\nLooking at (1,0), the possible bomb locations are (2,0) or (1,1) or (2,1). But (1,1) is a '1', so it's not a bomb. So the bomb for (1,0) must be either (2,0) or (2,1). Similarly, for (1,1), the possible bombs are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). But (0,0) and (0,1) are empty, so the bomb must be in (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), or (2,2). \n\nWait, maybe I should look for squares where the number plus the flags add up to more than the number, which would indicate a conflict. For example, if a '1' has two flags around it, that's a problem because it can only have one bomb. \n\nLooking at (0,8) which is '1', the adjacent flags are (0,9). So that's one flag. The other possible bomb could be in (0,7), (1,7), or (1,8). Since (1,8) is '1', it's not a bomb, so the bomb must be in (0,7) or (1,7). \n\nWait, but (0,7) is '_', which is revealed as empty, so that can't be a bomb. So the bomb must be in (1,7). But (1,7) is '_', so it's revealed as empty. Hmm, that can't be. So maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, no, (0,7) is '_', which is empty, so the bomb must be in (1,7). But (1,7) is also '_', so that's a problem because (0,8) is '1' and the only possible bomb adjacent is (1,7), which is revealed as empty. That would mean that (0,8) is a '1' but there's no bomb adjacent, which can't be right. So maybe I made a mistake in my analysis. \n\nWait, perhaps (1,7) is not revealed yet. Let me check the board again. The board shows row 0 as \"_ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\", so (0,7) is '1' and (0,8) is '_', and (0,9) is 'F'. Then row 1 is \"1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\". So (1,7) is '_', (1,8) is '1', and (1,9) is '.'. \n\nWait, so (0,8) is '_', not '1'. I think I misread that earlier. So (0,8) is '_', and (0,7) is '1'. So, (0,7) is '1', which means it has exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares would be (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). \n\nBut (0,6) is '_', (0,8) is '_', (1,6) is '_', (1,7) is '_', and (1,8) is '1'. So the bomb adjacent to (0,7) must be in one of those squares. Since (1,8) is '1', it's not a bomb, so the bomb must be in (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), or (1,7). \n\nBut (0,6) is '_', so it's revealed as empty, meaning no bomb there. So the bomb must be in (0,8), (1,6), or (1,7). But (0,8) is '_', which is empty, so the bomb must be in (1,6) or (1,7). \n\nWait, but (1,6) is '_', which is revealed as empty, so that can't be. So the bomb must be in (1,7). But (1,7) is '_', which is revealed as empty. That's a problem because (0,7) is '1' and the only possible bomb is in (1,7), which is empty. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that (0,7) is '1', and the adjacent squares include (1,7), which is '_', and (1,8) is '1'. So perhaps the bomb is in (1,7), but that square is empty, which would mean (0,7) is incorrect, which can't be. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the board. \n\nWait, perhaps (0,7) is '1', and the adjacent squares are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). Since (0,6) is '_', (0,8) is '_', (1,6) is '_', (1,7) is '_', and (1,8) is '1'. So the bomb must be in one of these, but all are either empty or '1's, which can't be bombs. So this is confusing. Maybe I should look elsewhere for easier clues. \n\nLooking at row 2, column 0 is 'F', so that's a flag. Then (2,1) is '.', (2,2) is '.', (2,3) is '.', (2,4) is '1', (2,5) is '.', (2,6) is '.', (2,7) is '1', (2,8) is '2', (2,9) is '.'. \n\nSo, (2,4) is '1', which means it has exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares would be (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). \n\nLooking at these, (1,3) is '2', (1,4) is '1', (1,5) is '1', (2,3) is '.', (2,5) is '.', (3,3) is '1', (3,4) is '2', (3,5) is '1'. \n\nSo the bomb adjacent to (2,4) must be in one of these squares. Since (2,4) is '1', there's exactly one bomb around it. So, let's see: (1,3) is '2', which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (1,4) is '1', also a number, not a bomb. (1,5) is '1', same. (2,3) is '.', (2,5) is '.', (3,3) is '1', (3,4) is '2', (3,5) is '1'. So the bomb must be in either (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5). \n\nBut (2,3) and (2,5) are '.' meaning unexplored, so they could be bombs. However, since (2,4) is '1', only one of them can be a bomb. \n\nSimilarly, looking at (3,4) which is '2', it has two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). \n\nSo, (3,4) is '2', so there must be exactly two bombs around it. Let's see which of these could be bombs. (2,3) is '.', (2,4) is '1', (2,5) is '.', (3,3) is '1', (3,5) is '1', (4,3) is '1', (4,4) is '_', (4,5) is '.'. \n\nSo the bombs must be in (2,3), (2,5), (4,3), (4,5). But since (2,4) is '1', which has only one bomb adjacent, which we thought might be (2,3) or (2,5), but (3,4) is '2' which needs two bombs. So maybe (2,3) and (2,5) are both bombs, but that would make (2,4) have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts (2,4) being '1'. So that can't be. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the bombs are in (4,3) and (4,5). Let me check. (4,3) is '1', which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (4,5) is '.', which could be a bomb. So maybe one bomb is in (4,5), and another somewhere else. \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that is surrounded by numbers which can help me deduce where the bombs are. \n\nLooking at row 5, column 1 is '1', column 2 is '1', column 3 is '1', column 4 is '.', column 5 is '1', column 6 is '1', column 7 is '2', column 8 is '.', and column 9 is '.'. \n\nSo, (5,1) is '1', which has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). \n\nBut (4,0) is '_', (4,1) is '1', (4,2) is '.', (5,0) is '_', (5,2) is '1', (6,0) is '_', (6,1) is '_', (6,2) is '_'. So the bomb must be in one of these. Since (4,1) is '1' and (5,2) is '1', they are numbers, not bombs. So the bomb must be in (4,2), (5,0), (6,1), or (6,2). \n\nBut (5,0) is '_', which is empty, so no bomb there. So the bomb is in (4,2), (6,1), or (6,2). \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for a square that is most constrained. \n\nLooking at (7,1) which is '2'. So, it has two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). \n\nBut (6,0) is '_', (6,1) is '_', (6,2) is '_', (7,0) is '_', (7,2) is '2', (8,0) is '_', (8,1) is '1', (8,2) is '.'. \n\nSo the bombs must be in two of these squares. Since (7,2) is '2', it's a number, not a bomb. (8,1) is '1', also a number. So the bombs could be in (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), or (8,2). \n\nBut (7,1) is '2', so two bombs must be in these. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the flags remaining. We have 8 flags left, and 10 bombs in total. So we have to place flags carefully. \n\nLooking back at the initial analysis, perhaps the best move is to place a flag where it's certain. But I'm not sure where that is. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a tile that is most likely safe. For example, looking at row 9, columns 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 are all '.' except (9,1) which is '1'. So (9,1) is '1', meaning it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). \n\n(8,0) is '_', (8,1) is '1', (8,2) is '.', (9,0) is '_', (9,2) is '.'. So the bomb must be in one of these. Since (8,1) is '1', it's a number, so the bomb must be in (8,2), (9,0), or (9,2). \n\nBut (9,0) is '_', which is empty, so the bomb must be in (8,2) or (9,2). \n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe I should look for a square that is surrounded by numbers that can help me deduce where the bombs are. \n\nWait, looking at (2,8) which is '2'. The adjacent squares are (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). \n\n(1,7) is '_', (1,8) is '1', (1,9) is '.', (2,7) is '1', (2,9) is '.', (3,7) is '_', (3,8) is '1', (3,9) is '.'. \n\nSo (2,8) is '2', meaning two bombs are adjacent. The possible bombs are in (1,7), (1,9), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9). Because (1,8) and (2,7) and (3,8) are numbers, so not bombs. \n\nSo, two of these must be bombs. \n\nBut I'm not sure which ones. \n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a square that is most likely safe to reveal. For example, (9,9) is a corner, but it's '.' so unexplored. Revealing that might be risky. \n\nAlternatively, looking at (6,5) which is '1', so it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). \n\n(5,4) is '.', (5,5) is '1', (5,6) is '1', (6,4) is '_', (6,6) is '_', (7,4) is '2', (7,5) is '2', (7,6) is '.'. \n\nSo the bomb must be in one of these. Since (5,5) and (5,6) are '1's, they are numbers, so the bomb must be in (5,4), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6). \n\nBut (6,5) is '1', so only one bomb is there. \n\nThis is really tricky. I think I need to make an educated guess. Maybe I should reveal a square that is adjacent to a '1' which has only one possible bomb location. \n\nWait, looking back at (0,7) which is '1', and the only possible bomb is in (1,7). But (1,7) is '_', which is empty. So that can't be. So perhaps (0,7) is incorrect, which can't be. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the board. \n\nWait, maybe I should check other parts. Looking at (8,1) which is '1', the adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). \n\n(7,0) is '_', (7,1) is '2', (7,2) is '2', (8,0) is '_', (8,2) is '.', (9,0) is '_', (9,1) is '1', (9,2) is '.'. \n\nSo the bomb must be in one of these. Since (7,1) and (7,2) are numbers, they can't be bombs. So the bomb must be in (7,0), (8,2), (9,0), or (9,2). \n\nBut (8,1) is '1', so only one bomb is there. \n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should consider placing a flag where it's most likely to be a bomb based on the numbers. \n\nLooking at (3,3) which is '1', adjacent squares are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). \n\n(2,2) is '.', (2,3) is '.', (2,4) is '1', (3,2) is '.', (3,4) is '2', (4,2) is '.', (4,3) is '1', (4,4) is '_'. \n\nSo the bomb must be in one of these. Since (2,4) is '1' and (3,4) is '2', they are numbers. So the bomb is in (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (4,2), or (4,4). \n\nBut (3,3) is '1', so only one bomb is there. \n\nI think I need to make a move. Maybe I'll reveal a square that's adjacent to a '1' which has only one possible bomb location. \n\nWait, looking at (5,7) which is '2'. The adjacent squares are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). \n\n(4,6) is '_', (4,7) is '1', (4,8) is '2', (5,6) is '1', (5,8) is '.', (6,6) is '_', (6,7) is '_', (6,8) is '.'. \n\nSo the bombs must be in two of these. Since (4,7) is '1', (4,8) is '2', (5,6) is '1', they are numbers. So bombs must be in (4,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). \n\nBut (5,7) is '2', so two bombs are there. \n\nI think I'll have to make a guess. Maybe I'll reveal (6,7), which is '.', to see if it's a bomb or not. If it's a number, that could help. \n\nBut wait, if I reveal (6,7) and it's a bomb, the game is over. So that's risky. Alternatively, maybe I should place a flag where it's more certain. \n\nWait, looking at (4,8) which is '2'. The adjacent squares are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). \n\n(3,7) is '_', (3,8) is '1', (3,9) is '.', (4,7) is '1', (4,9) is '.', (5,7) is '2', (5,8) is '.', (5,9) is '.'. \n\nSo the bombs must be in two of these. Since (3,8) is '1', (4,7) is '1', (5,7) is '2', they are numbers. So the bombs must be in (3,7), (3,9), (4,9), (5,8), (5,9). \n\nBut (4,8) is '2', so two bombs are there. \n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, making it a likely candidate for a bomb. \n\nLooking at (7,2) which is '2'. The adjacent squares are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). \n\n(6,1) is '_', (6,2) is '_', (6,3) is '_', (7,1) is '2', (7,3) is '2', (8,1) is '1', (8,2) is '.', (8,3) is '.'. \n\nSo the bombs must be in two of these. Since (7,1) and (7,3) are numbers, they can't be bombs. So the bombs must be in (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (8,2), or (8,3). \n\nBut (7,2) is '2', so two bombs are there. \n\nI think I'm going to have to make a move. Maybe I'll place a flag at (2,3) because it's adjacent to (2,4) which is '1', and if (2,3) is a bomb, that would satisfy (2,4)'s '1'. \n\nBut wait, (2,4) is '1', so if I flag (2,3) as a bomb, that would make (2,4) correct. Let me check if that causes any conflicts elsewhere. \n\nIf (2,3) is a bomb, then (3,3) which is '1' would have that bomb adjacent, which is fine. Also, (3,4) is '2', so it would have one bomb at (2,3) and needs another somewhere else. \n\nSo, placing a flag at (2,3) might be a good move. \n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if (2,3) is actually a bomb. Maybe I should reveal it instead. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (2,3) to see if it's a number or a bomb. \n\nBut if I reveal it and it's a bomb, the game ends. So that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (2,5) because it's adjacent to (2,4) which is '1', and if (2,5) is a number, that could help. \n\nBut again, if it's a bomb, the game is over. \n\nI think I'll have to make a choice. Since I have 8 flags left, maybe I should place a flag where it's most likely to be a bomb. \n\nLooking at (1,6) which is '_', and adjacent to (1,5) which is '1' and (1,7) which is '_', and (0,6) which is '_', etc. Maybe (1,6) is a bomb. \n\nAlternatively, looking at (5,5) which is '1', and adjacent squares might have a bomb. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a square that is adjacent to a '1' and has no other possible bombs, making it the only option. \n\nLooking at (0,7) which is '1', and the only possible bomb is (1,7). But (1,7) is '_', which is empty. So that can't be. So perhaps (0,7) is a '1' with no adjacent bombs, which can't be right. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. \n\n(0,7) is '1', adjacent squares are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). \n\n(0,6) is '_', (0,8) is '_', (1,6) is '_', (1,7) is '_', (1,8) is '1'. \n\nSo the bomb must be in one of these. But all are either '_' or '1's, which can't be bombs. So this is a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps (0,7) is '1' and the bomb is in (1,7), which is '_', but that would mean (1,7) is a bomb, but it's currently empty. So that can't be. \n\nThis suggests that perhaps (0,7) is incorrect, but that can't be because the game is ongoing. So maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps (1,7) is a bomb, but it's revealed as empty, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm misreading the board. \n\nWait, looking back, row 1 is \"1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\". So (1,6) is '_', (1,7) is '_', (1,8) is '1', (1,9) is '.'. \n\nSo (0,7) is '1', and the adjacent squares include (1,7) which is '_', but if (1,7) is a bomb, then (1,8) which is '1' would have two bombs adjacent: (0,7) and (1,7). But (1,8) is '1', which can only have one bomb. So that's a conflict. \n\nTherefore, (1,7) cannot be a bomb because it would cause (1,8) to have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts (1,8) being '1'. \n\nSo, where is the bomb for (0,7)? It must be in (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), or (1,8). But (1,8) is '1', so it can't be a bomb. So the bomb must be in (0,6), (0,8), or (1,6). \n\nBut (0,6) is '_', (0,8) is '_', and (1,6) is '_'. So all are empty, which is impossible because (0,7) is '1'. \n\nThis suggests that there's an inconsistency, but that can't be because the game is ongoing. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the board layout. \n\nWait, maybe (0,7) is '1', and the bomb is in (1,6). Let's assume that (1,6) is a bomb. Then, (1,5) is '1', which would have the bomb at (1,6) adjacent, satisfying its '1'. Similarly, (1,6) being a bomb would affect (1,7), which is '_', but (1,7) is empty, so that's okay. \n\nWait, but (1,6) is '_', which is empty, so it can't be a bomb. So that can't be. \n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to place a flag somewhere else. \n\nLooking at (9,5), which is '.', maybe it's a bomb. But I have no information about it. \n\nAlternatively, looking at (4,5) which is '.', and adjacent to (4,4) which is '_', and (4,6) which is '_'. \n\nI think I'm going to have to make a guess. Maybe I'll place a flag at (2,3) because it's adjacent to (2,4) which is '1', and if (2,3) is a bomb, that would satisfy the '1'. \n\nSo, I'll place a flag at (2,3). \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should reveal it instead. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal (1,6) to see if it's a bomb or not. \n\nBut if I reveal (1,6) and it's a bomb, the game ends. \n\nI think I'll have to take the risk and reveal (1,6). \n\nWait, no, I have 8 flags left, so maybe it's better to place a flag where I'm more certain. \n\nAlternatively, looking at (5,5) which is '1', and adjacent squares. \n\nI think I'm going to have to make a move without being certain. \n\nI'll decide to place a flag at (2,3), assuming it's a bomb, which would satisfy (2,4)'s '1'. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, another thought: since (2,4) is '1', and (2,3) is '.', if I flag (2,3), then (2,4) is satisfied. Also, (3,3) is '1', which would have the bomb at (2,3) adjacent, which is good. \n\nSo, I'll place a flag at (2,3). \n\nBut I'm still not 100% sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (2,3) to confirm. \n\nBut if I reveal it and it's a bomb, I lose. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I'll go with placing a flag at (2,3). \n\nWait, but the user asked for the next move, so I'll format it accordingly. \n\nWait, no, I think I should reveal (2,3) to see if it's a bomb or not. \n\nBut that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a '1' and has only one possible bomb location. \n\nLooking at (5,7) which is '2', and the possible bombs are in (4,6), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). \n\nIf I could find a square that is adjacent to multiple '1's, that might be a bomb. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nI think I'm going to have to make a move. I'll decide to reveal (2,3). \n\nWait, but that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, I'll place a flag at (2,3). \n\nI think I'll go with that. \n\nSo, the move is to place a flag at (2,3). \n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. \n\nWait, another thought: looking at (3,4) which is '2', and the possible bombs are in (2,3), (2,5), (4,3), (4,5). \n\nIf (2,3) is a bomb, then (3,4) needs another bomb, perhaps in (4,5). \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nI think I'll proceed with placing a flag at (2,3). \n\nSo, the move is (2,3) with flag=true. \n\nBut I'm not certain. \n\nWait, no, I think I should reveal (2,3) instead. \n\nBut if it's a bomb, the game ends. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I'll have to take the risk and reveal (2,3). \n\nSo, the move is (2,3) with flag=false. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a square that is adjacent to a '1' and has no other possible bombs. \n\nLooking at (0,7) which is '1', and the only possible bomb is in (1,7), but that's empty. So that can't be. \n\nI'm stuck. \n\nMaybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a '1' and has only one possible bomb location. \n\nWait, looking at (5,5) which is '1', and the possible bombs are in (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). \n\nBut (5,4) is '.', (5,6) is '1', (4,4) is '_', (4,5) is '.', (4,6) is '_', (6,4) is '_', (6,5) is '1', (6,6) is '.'. \n\nSo the bomb must be in one of these. \n\nBut I don't see a clear choice. \n\nI think I'll have to make a guess. \n\nI'll decide to place a flag at (2,3). \n\nSo, the move is (2,3), flag=true. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (2,3). \n\nI think I'll go with revealing (2,3). \n\nSo, the move is (2,3), flag=false. \n\nBut if it's a bomb, the game ends. \n\nI think I'll proceed with that. \n\nWait, but I have to make sure that I'm not making a move that causes a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a '1' and has only one possible bomb location. \n\nLooking at (0,7) which is '1', and the only possible bomb is in (1,7), which is empty, so that can't be. \n\nI think I'm stuck. \n\nI think I'll have to make a move based on the analysis I did earlier. \n\nI'll place a flag at (2,3). \n\nSo, the move is (2,3), flag=true. \n\nBut I'm not confident. \n\nWait, another thought: looking at (3,4) which is '2', and if (2,3) is a bomb, then another bomb must be adjacent. \n\nSo, if I place a flag at (2,3), then (3,4) needs another bomb. \n\nLooking at (4,5), which is '.', maybe that's the other bomb. \n\nSo, placing a flag at (2,3) and (4,5) would satisfy (3,4)'s '2'. \n\nBut I can only place one flag at a time. \n\nSo, I'll proceed with placing a flag at (2,3). \n\nI think that's the best I can do for now. \n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (2,3) because it's adjacent to (2,4) which is '1', suggesting it might be a bomb. This move aims to satisfy the '1' at (2,4) without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nMOVE: 2,3,true", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the rules.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has already placed some flags, and there are 7 flags remaining. My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. I need to make sure I don't reveal a bomb, which would end the game.\n\nLooking at the board, I see some revealed numbers and some flagged squares (marked as F). The rest are either unexplored (.) or empty revealed spaces (_). I need to analyze the numbers and flags to see if any conflicts exist or if I can place a new flag without breaking the rules.\n\nLet me go through each revealed number and check the adjacent flags. For example, in row 0, column 8, there's a 1. That means exactly one bomb is adjacent to it. Looking around (0,8), the adjacent squares are (0,7), (1,7), and (1,8). (1,8) is a flag, so that's one bomb accounted for. Therefore, there can't be any other bombs adjacent to (0,8). So I should check if any other squares around (0,8) are flagged or if any other numbers would conflict if I place a flag nearby.\n\nWait, (0,8) is a 1, and (1,8) is an F. So the bomb is already accounted for by (1,8). Therefore, the other adjacent squares to (0,8) must be safe. That means (0,7) and (1,7) can't be bombs. So if I look at (0,7), it's currently a 1, but wait, (0,7) is actually a 1 in the initial state. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back, row 0 has the following: columns 0-9. At (0,8), it's a 1. The adjacent squares are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (0,9). (1,8) is an F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares must not have bombs. So (0,7) is a 1, which is the square itself. Wait, no, (0,7) is a 1, but that's a different square. So the square at (0,7) shows 1, meaning it has one adjacent bomb. Since (1,7) is adjacent to (0,7), and (0,7) is a 1, but (0,7) is a 1, so it's already indicating one bomb. But (1,8) is an F, which is adjacent to (0,7) as well. So (0,7) is a 1, and one of its adjacent squares is (1,8), which is an F. Therefore, (0,7) can't have any other bombs adjacent to it. So that means (0,6) and (1,7) can't be bombs.\n\nWait, but (0,7) is a 1, so it has exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (1,8) is a flag, that's the one. So the other adjacent squares to (0,7) must be safe. So (0,6), (1,6), and (1,7) must be safe. But (1,7) is a _, so maybe it's already been revealed as safe. Wait, looking back, row 1, column 7 is _, so it's been revealed as empty. So that's safe. Therefore, (0,6) is a . which is unexplored. So maybe I can consider revealing it since it's safe.\n\nBut before I do that, I should check other numbers to see if placing a flag is possible without conflicting. Let me look for other numbers that might indicate possible bomb locations.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 0 is an F, and column 3 is also an F. So in row 2, columns 0 and 3 are flagged. Let's see the numbers around them. For example, at (2,4), it's a 1. So that means exactly one bomb is adjacent to (2,4). The adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (3,4), and (3,5). But (2,3) is an F, so that's one bomb. So the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. Therefore, (1,3) is an F, but wait, (1,3) is a 2 in the initial board. Wait, no, in row 1, column 3 is a 2, which is a number, not a flag. So (2,4) is a 1, and (2,3) is an F, so that accounts for the one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares to (2,4) must be safe.\n\nSo (1,3) is a 2, which means it has two bombs adjacent. But (2,3) is an F, so that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb adjacent to (1,3). Let's look at (1,3)'s adjacent squares: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (2,3) is an F, so that's one. So another bomb must be in one of the other squares. Let's see which of these are revealed or flagged.\n\n(0,2) is _, (0,3) is _, (0,4) is _, (1,2) is 1, (1,4) is 1, (2,2) is _, (2,4) is 1. So the possible squares for the second bomb are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (2,2). Because the others are either numbers or already have flags.\n\nBut wait, (1,2) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. Let's look at (1,2). Its adjacent squares are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (2,3) is an F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. So (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2) can't have bombs. Wait, but (1,3) is a 2, which needs another bomb. So the only possible place left is (0,4), but (1,4) is a 1, which is adjacent to (0,4). Let me see.\n\n(1,4) is a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (2,3) is an F, so that's one bomb. So the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. Therefore, (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5) can't have bombs. Wait, but (1,3) is a 2, which needs another bomb. So the only possible place is (0,4), but (1,4) is a 1, and if (0,4) is a bomb, then (1,4) would have two bombs adjacent (from (2,3) and (0,4)), which contradicts (1,4) being a 1. Therefore, (0,4) can't be a bomb. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. (1,3) is a 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. One is at (2,3), so another must be somewhere else. The possible squares are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (2,2). But (1,2) is a 1, which only allows one bomb adjacent, and (2,3) is already that. So (0,2) can't be a bomb because (1,2) is a 1 and (2,3) is already the only bomb. Similarly, (2,2) is adjacent to (1,2), which is a 1, so (2,2) can't be a bomb. That leaves (0,3) and (0,4). But (1,4) is a 1, which would be adjacent to (0,4) if it's a bomb, which would make (1,4) have two bombs adjacent (from (2,3) and (0,4)), which is impossible because (1,4) is a 1. Therefore, (0,4) can't be a bomb. So (0,3) is the only possibility.\n\nBut (0,3) is adjacent to (0,4), which is a 1, so if (0,3) is a bomb, then (0,4) would have two bombs adjacent (from (0,3) and (2,3)), but (0,4) is a 1, which can't have two. Therefore, (0,3) can't be a bomb either. This is a problem because (1,3) is a 2 and needs another bomb, but all possible squares are conflicting. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the current flags or the numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the adjacent squares. Let me list all the adjacent squares for (1,3):\n\n(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nWe know (2,3) is an F, so that's one bomb. So the other bomb must be in one of the other squares. But as I thought earlier, all the other squares are constrained by other numbers. This might mean that one of the existing flags is incorrectly placed. For example, if (2,3) is not a bomb, then (1,3) would need two other bombs, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps (1,3) is a 2, and the other bomb is somewhere else not adjacent to conflicting numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look elsewhere for a possible move. Maybe I can find a square that is definitely safe to reveal or a square where placing a flag is possible without conflicting.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 1 is a 2. Its adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) is an F, so that's one bomb. So the other bomb must be adjacent. Let's see which squares are possible. (2,1) is _, (2,2) is _, (3,0) is 1, (3,2) is _, (4,0) is _, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is _.\n\nSo the other bomb could be in (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), or (4,2). But (3,0) is a 1, which is adjacent to (2,0) (an F) and (4,0). So (3,0) is a 1, meaning only one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0) is an F, (4,0) can't be a bomb. Therefore, (4,0) is safe. Similarly, (4,1) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0) is a 1, (3,1) is a 2, (3,2) is _, (4,0) is safe, (4,2) is _, (5,0) is _, (5,1) is _, (5,2) is _.\n\nBut (4,1) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. Let's see if any of its adjacent squares are already bombs or flags. (3,1) is a 2, which is a number, not a flag. So the only possible bomb adjacent to (4,1) could be in (3,2) or (4,2) or (5,1) or (5,2). But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that is definitely safe to reveal. For example, in row 0, column 7 is a 1, and we determined that (0,6) is safe because (0,7) can't have any other bombs. So revealing (0,6) would be safe. Alternatively, looking at row 4, column 1 is a 1, and its adjacent squares might be safe.\n\nWait, row 4, column 1 is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0) is a 1, (3,1) is a 2, (3,2) is _, (4,0) is _, (4,2) is _, (5,0) is _, (5,1) is _, (5,2) is _.\n\nBut (4,1) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. Since (3,1) is a 2, which is a number, not a flag, perhaps (4,1) is adjacent to a bomb in (3,2) or (5,1), but without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, column 1 is a 1. Its adjacent squares include (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,1) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If I reveal (5,0), which is a ., maybe that's safe. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider placing a flag where it's definitely a bomb. Let me look for squares that must be bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 9 is an F. So that's one bomb. Row 2, column 0 and 3 are Fs, so that's two more. So total flags are 3, and there are 7 remaining. So I need to place 7 more flags, but wait, the total bombs are 10, so if there are 3 flags, that leaves 7 bombs to be flagged.\n\nWait, no. The game info says bombs:10, and flags remaining:7. So the player has already placed some flags, and can place up to 7 more. Wait, no, the flags remaining is 7, meaning the player can place 7 flags. So total flags allowed are 10, but in the initial state, I see some Fs. Let me count them.\n\nLooking at the board, I see Fs at:\n\n(0,8), (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (3,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,1), (8,2), (9,1), (9,2). Wait, that's more than 10. Wait, no, the board is 10x10, so each row has 10 columns. Let me count the Fs:\n\nRow 0: (0,8), (0,9) \u2192 2 Fs\n\nRow 1: none\n\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,3) \u2192 2 Fs\n\nRow 3: (3,0) \u2192 1 F\n\nRow 4: none\n\nRow 5: none\n\nRow 6: none\n\nRow 7: (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4) \u2192 4 Fs\n\nRow 8: (8,1), (8,2) \u2192 2 Fs\n\nRow 9: (9,1), (9,2) \u2192 2 Fs\n\nTotal Fs: 2+2+1+4+2+2=13 Fs. But the game info says flags remaining:7, which suggests that the player can place 7 more flags. Wait, that doesn't add up because the total bombs are 10, so the player should have placed 10 flags in total. So perhaps the initial count is wrong. Maybe some of the Fs are actually revealed as safe, but looking at the board, the Fs are in the initial state, so maybe the player has already placed 3 Fs, and has 7 remaining. Or perhaps the board has some Fs that are correct, and others that are incorrect.\n\nWait, the initial board state shows some Fs, but the game info says flags remaining:7. So the player can place 7 more flags. So the current number of flags on the board is 3, and the player can place 7 more, totaling 10.\n\nWait, let me recount the Fs on the board:\n\nRow 0: (0,8) and (0,9) \u2192 2\n\nRow 2: (2,0) and (2,3) \u2192 2\n\nRow 3: (3,0) \u2192 1\n\nRow 7: (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4) \u21924\n\nRow 8: (8,1), (8,2) \u21922\n\nRow 9: (9,1), (9,2) \u21922\n\nTotal: 2+2+1+4+2+2=13 Fs. That's more than the total bombs, which is 10. So that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps some of the Fs are incorrect, and the player needs to remove some. Alternatively, perhaps the initial board state is incorrect, but I think the user provided the board as is.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check again.\n\nRow 0: columns 8 and 9 \u2192 2 Fs\n\nRow 1: none\n\nRow 2: columns 0 and 3 \u2192 2 Fs\n\nRow 3: column 0 \u21921 F\n\nRow 4: none\n\nRow 5: none\n\nRow 6: none\n\nRow 7: columns 1,2,3,4 \u21924 Fs\n\nRow 8: columns 1,2 \u21922 Fs\n\nRow 9: columns 1,2 \u21922 Fs\n\nTotal: 2+2+1+4+2+2=13 Fs. That's 13, but the total bombs are 10, so the player has overflagged. Therefore, some of these Fs must be incorrect, and the player needs to remove some. But according to the game info, flags remaining:7, which suggests that the player has already placed 3 Fs, and can place 7 more, totaling 10. Therefore, the initial board must have 3 Fs, not 13. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the board.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided the board state as:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 F . . F 1 _ _ 1 2 .\n3 1 2 . 2 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n7 _ 1 2 2 1 1 . . . .\n8 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n9 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nSo in row 0, columns 8 is 1, 9 is F.\n\nRow 1: all numbers and dots.\n\nRow 2: F at 0 and 3.\n\nRow 3: F at 0.\n\nRow 7: columns 1-4 are 1,2,2,1, but the last part is . . . . So maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, row 7: columns 0 is _, 1 is 1, 2 is 2, 3 is 2, 4 is 1, 5 is 1, 6 is ., 7 is ., 8 is ., 9 is . So no Fs in row 7.\n\nSimilarly, row 8: columns 0 is _, 1 is 1, 2 is ., etc.\n\nRow 9: columns 0 is _, 1 is 1, etc.\n\nWait, I think I misread the board. The user provided the board state as:\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n\nSo row 0, column 9 is F.\n\nRow 2: F . . F 1 _ _ 1 2 .\n\nSo columns 0 and 3 are F.\n\nRow 3: 1 2 . 2 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nSo column 0 is 1, not F.\n\nWait, no, row 3 starts with 1, so column 0 is 1, not F. So the Fs are only in row 0, column 9; row 2, columns 0 and 3.\n\nSo total Fs: row 0:1, row2:2. Total 3 Fs. That makes sense because flags remaining:7, so the player can place 7 more.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So the current flags are at (0,9), (2,0), and (2,3). So the player has placed 3 flags, and can place 7 more.\n\nNow, back to the analysis. Let's look for a square where placing a flag is possible without conflicting with the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 9 is an F, so that's one bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. The adjacent squares are (0,8), which is a 1, and (1,8), which is a 1, and (1,9), which is a .. So (0,9) is an F, which is a bomb, so (0,8) is a 1, which is satisfied because it's adjacent to (0,9). Similarly, (1,8) is a 1, which is also satisfied because it's adjacent to (0,9). So that's fine.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 0 is an F. Its adjacent squares are (1,0), (2,1), (1,1), (3,0), (3,1). (1,0) is a 1, (2,1) is ., (1,1) is 1, (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 2. So the F at (2,0) is a bomb, which affects the numbers around it. (1,0) is a 1, which is correct because it's adjacent to (2,0). Similarly, (3,0) is a 1, which is also correct because it's adjacent to (2,0). So that's fine.\n\nRow 2, column 3 is an F. Its adjacent squares are (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (1,3) is a 2, (2,4) is a 1, (3,3) is a 2, etc. So placing a flag at (2,3) as a bomb affects these numbers. Let's check if this is consistent.\n\n(1,3) is a 2, which means it needs two bombs adjacent. One is at (2,3), so another must be nearby. Let's look at (1,3)'s adjacent squares: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (2,3) is an F, so that's one. The other must be in one of the other squares. Let's see which are possible.\n\n(0,2) is _, (0,3) is _, (0,4) is _, (1,2) is 1, (1,4) is 1, (2,2) is _, (2,4) is 1. So the other bomb must be in (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), or (2,2). But (1,2) is a 1, which is adjacent to (2,2) and (0,2). If (2,2) is a bomb, then (1,2) would have two bombs adjacent (from (2,3) and (2,2)), which would make (1,2) a 2, but (1,2) is a 1. Therefore, (2,2) can't be a bomb. Similarly, (0,2) is adjacent to (1,2), which is a 1, so (0,2) can't be a bomb. Therefore, the only possible squares are (0,3) or (0,4). But (0,4) is adjacent to (1,4), which is a 1. If (0,4) is a bomb, then (1,4) would have two bombs adjacent (from (2,3) and (0,4)), which would make (1,4) a 2, but (1,4) is a 1. Therefore, (0,4) can't be a bomb. Similarly, (0,3) is adjacent to (1,3), which is a 2, but (0,3) is a ., so it's possible. Wait, but (0,3) is adjacent to (0,4), which is a 1. If (0,3) is a bomb, then (0,4) would have two bombs adjacent (from (0,3) and (2,3)), which would make (0,4) a 2, but (0,4) is a 1. Therefore, (0,3) can't be a bomb either. This is a problem because (1,3) is a 2, and we can't find another bomb adjacent to it without conflicting with other numbers. This suggests that either the flag at (2,3) is incorrect, or there's a mistake in the board.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag at (2,3) is correct, and I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the other bomb adjacent to (1,3) is not in the squares I considered. Wait, (1,3)'s adjacent squares include (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). We've considered all except (0,4), which is a 1, but can't be a bomb. So I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the flag at (2,3) is incorrect and should be removed. If I remove the flag at (2,3), then (1,3) is a 2, which would need two bombs adjacent. But then, where would those bombs be? Let's see: without (2,3) being a bomb, the two bombs must be elsewhere. Let's see the possible squares: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4). But (1,2) is a 1, so (2,2) can't be a bomb. Similarly, (0,2) can't be a bomb because (1,2) is a 1. So the only possibilities are (0,3) and (0,4), but as before, (0,4) can't be a bomb because (1,4) is a 1. Therefore, this approach isn't working.\n\nMaybe I should look for another square where placing a flag is possible without conflict. Let's look at row 5, column 7 is a 2. Its adjacent squares are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (5,7) is a 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. Let's see if any of these squares are already flags or numbers that would conflict.\n\nLooking at (5,7), adjacent squares: (4,6) is _, (4,7) is 2, (4,8) is ., (5,6) is 1, (5,8) is ., (6,6) is 1, (6,7) is ., (6,8) is .. So no flags nearby. Therefore, it's possible that two of these squares are bombs. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, column 8 is a 2. Its adjacent squares are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (4,8) is a 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. Let's see: (3,7) is _, (3,8) is 1, (3,9) is ., (4,7) is ., (4,9) is ., (5,7) is 2, (5,8) is ., (5,9) is .. So no flags nearby, but (3,8) is a 1, which is adjacent to (4,8). So (3,8) is a 1, meaning it has one bomb adjacent. Therefore, one of its adjacent squares is a bomb. Let's see: (3,8)'s adjacent squares are (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). (4,8) is a 2, so if (4,8) is a bomb, then (3,8) would have one bomb, which is correct. So placing a flag at (4,8) would satisfy (3,8)'s 1. But (4,8) is a 2, meaning it needs two bombs adjacent. So if (4,8) is a bomb, then the other bomb must be adjacent to it. But (4,8) is a number, not a flag, so it can't be a bomb. Therefore, (4,8) is a 2, so it's not a bomb, but it indicates two bombs are adjacent. So the two bombs must be in its adjacent squares. But (3,8) is a 1, which is adjacent to one bomb, so one of the bombs for (4,8) is the same as for (3,8). Let me see.\n\nIf (4,8) is a 2, it needs two bombs adjacent. Let's say one is at (5,8), and another at (5,7). But (5,7) is a 2, which is a number, not a bomb. Alternatively, maybe (5,9) and (3,7). But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a square where placing a flag would satisfy a 1, and not conflict with other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 9 is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (2,8), (2,9), (3,8), (4,8), (4,9). (2,8) is a 1, (2,9) is ., (3,8) is 1, (4,8) is 2, (4,9) is .. So if I place a flag at (3,9), which is a ., then (3,9) would be a bomb. But (3,8) is a 1, which is adjacent to (3,9), so that would satisfy (3,8)'s 1. Also, (4,8) is a 2, which would need another bomb adjacent. So placing a flag at (3,9) might be possible.\n\nBut wait, (3,9) is adjacent to (2,9), which is a ., and (4,9), which is a .. So placing a flag at (3,9) would mean that (2,9) and (4,9) can't have bombs. But (2,9) is adjacent to (0,9), which is a bomb. Wait, no, (0,9) is an F, so it's a bomb. (2,9) is adjacent to (0,9), which is a bomb, so (2,9) can't be a bomb. Therefore, placing a flag at (3,9) would be possible, as it doesn't conflict with any numbers.\n\nWait, but (3,9) is a ., so it's unexplored. If I place a flag there, it would count towards the remaining flags. But I need to check if it conflicts with any numbers. (3,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (3,9) being a bomb. (4,8) is a 2, which would need another bomb adjacent. If (3,9) is a bomb, then (4,8) would have one bomb at (3,9), so it needs another bomb adjacent. The possible squares are (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). But (4,7) is ., (4,9) is ., (5,7) is 2, (5,8) is ., (5,9) is .. So it's possible, but I can't confirm without more info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that is definitely safe. For example, in row 0, column 6 is a ., and since (0,7) is a 1, which is adjacent to (0,6), and (0,7) is a 1, which has one bomb at (0,9), so (0,6) is safe. Therefore, revealing (0,6) would be safe.\n\nBut the goal is to either reveal or flag. Since I have 7 flags remaining, perhaps it's better to place a flag where possible. But I need to ensure it doesn't conflict.\n\nWait, let me think again about row 3, column 9. If I place a flag there, it would satisfy (3,8)'s 1, and (4,8)'s 2 would need another bomb. But I don't know where that would be. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal (0,6) because it's safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another approach is to look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which might indicate a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5 is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (5,5) is a 1, so it needs one bomb adjacent. Let's see if any of these squares are already bombs or flags. (4,4) is a 1, (4,5) is _, (4,6) is _, (5,4) is 1, (5,6) is 1, (6,4) is _, (6,5) is 1, (6,6) is 1. So no flags nearby. So the bomb could be in any of these squares. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, column 5 is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (6,5) is a 1, so it needs one bomb adjacent. Let's see: (5,5) is a 1, (5,4) is 1, (5,6) is 1, (7,4) is 1, (7,5) is 1, (7,6) is .. So no flags nearby. The bomb could be in any of these squares, but again, no clear indication.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just reveal a square that is definitely safe. As I thought earlier, (0,6) is safe because (0,7) is a 1, which is adjacent to (0,9), a bomb. So (0,6) can't have a bomb. Therefore, revealing (0,6) would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, column 0 is a ., and (3,0) is a 1, which is adjacent to (2,0), an F. So (4,0) is adjacent to (3,0), which is a 1, so (4,0) can't be a bomb because (3,0) is a 1 and already has (2,0) as a bomb. Therefore, (4,0) is safe to reveal.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check (4,0). Its adjacent squares are (3,0), which is a 1, (5,0), which is _, (3,1), which is 2, and (4,1), which is 1. So (4,0) is adjacent to (3,0), which is a 1, and (3,1), which is a 2. Since (3,0) is a 1, it's already accounted for by (2,0). Therefore, (4,0) can't be a bomb because (3,0) is a 1 and (3,1) is a 2, which would require another bomb adjacent to (3,1). So (4,0) is safe.\n\nTherefore, revealing (4,0) would be safe. Alternatively, revealing (0,6) is also safe.\n\nBut since the player has 7 flags remaining, maybe it's better to place a flag where it's definitely a bomb. But I can't find any such square right now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the flag at (2,3) is incorrect because it's causing a conflict with (1,3)'s 2. Therefore, I should remove the flag at (2,3), which would allow (1,3) to have another bomb adjacent without conflicting. But I'm not sure if that's the right move.\n\nBut according to the rules, I can place or remove a flag. So if I think (2,3) is incorrectly flagged, I can remove it. But I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 5 is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (7,5) is a 1, so it needs one bomb adjacent. Let's see if any of these squares are already flagged or numbers that would conflict.\n\n(7,4) is a 1, (7,6) is ., (8,4) is _, (8,5) is _, (8,6) is .. So no flags nearby. The bomb could be in any of these squares, but without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nThis is really challenging. I think the safest move is to reveal a square that is definitely safe, like (0,6) or (4,0). Let me choose (0,6) because it's adjacent to (0,7), which is a 1, and (0,7) is already accounted for by (0,9). So revealing (0,6) would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (4,0) is also safe, as explained earlier.\n\nBut I'm not sure which one to choose. Let me go with (0,6).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The square at (0,6) is safe to reveal because it is adjacent to (0,7), which is a 1. Since (0,7) already has a bomb at (0,9), (0,6) cannot contain a bomb. Revealing this square provides more information about the board without risk.\n\nMOVE: 0,6,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has 7 flags remaining, which means they can place 7 more flags. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without hitting any.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares are already revealed, some are flagged with 'F', and others are still unexplored with '.'. The numbers on the board indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that square. For example, the square at (0,8) is '1', meaning it has exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\nI remember the critical flag placement rules. Each number must have exactly the number of bombs adjacent as it shows. So if a square shows '1', there must be exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares. Also, if a '1' already has a flag next to it, there can't be another bomb adjacent, so the other surrounding squares must be safe.\n\nLet me go through the board row by row to spot any obvious conflicts or possible moves.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- (0,0) to (0,7) are mostly unexplored, except (0,8) which is '1' and (0,9) which is 'F'. Since (0,8) is '1', it has one bomb adjacent. The flag at (0,9) is one possibility, but maybe there's another bomb nearby. However, since (0,8) is '1', if (0,9) is a flag, then the other adjacent squares around (0,8) must be safe. So I should check the squares around (0,8) to see if any are revealed or if there's a possible bomb.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n- (1,0) is '1', (1,1) is '1', (1,2) is '2', (1,3) is '1', (1,4) is '1', (1,5) is '_', (1,6) is '_', (1,7) is '1', (1,8) is '.', and (1,9) is '.'.\n\nWait, (1,0) is '1', so it has one adjacent bomb. Its adjacent squares would be (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0), (2,1). But (1,1) is also '1', which complicates things. Maybe I should look for squares that have numbers which can help me deduce where the bombs are.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n- (2,0) is 'F', (2,1) is '.', (2,2) is '.', (2,3) is 'F', (2,4) is '1', (2,5) is '_', (2,6) is '_', (2,7) is '1', (2,8) is '2', (2,9) is '.'.\n\nHmm, (2,0) is flagged, so that's one bomb accounted for. (2,3) is also flagged, so that's another. But wait, the total bombs are 10, and the flags remaining are 7, so currently, there are 3 flags placed (I see at least two in row 2, and one in row 0). Wait, let me count the flags:\n\nLooking through the board, I see:\n- (0,9) is 'F'\n- (2,0) is 'F'\n- (2,3) is 'F'\n- (5,0) is 'F' (wait, no, looking back, row 5 starts with '_', so maybe I miscounted). Wait, let me check each row again.\n\nRow 0: (0,9) is 'F' \u2192 1\nRow 1: No 'F's\nRow 2: (2,0) and (2,3) \u2192 2 more, total 3\nRow 3: (3,0) is '1', not 'F'\nRow 4: (4,0) is '_'\nRow 5: (5,0) is '_'\nRow 6: (6,0) is '_'\nRow 7: (7,0) is '_'\nRow 8: (8,0) is '_'\nRow 9: (9,0) is '_'\n\nSo total flags placed are 3, and flags remaining are 7, meaning 7 more can be placed. But the total bombs are 10, so 3 flags are placed, 7 remaining, so 10 bombs in total. So all bombs must be correctly flagged.\n\nNow, looking at row 0, (0,8) is '1', which has one adjacent bomb. The adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). Since (0,9) is 'F', that could be the one bomb adjacent to (0,8). So (0,8) is satisfied because it has one bomb at (0,9). Therefore, the other adjacent squares around (0,8) should be safe. So (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) should be safe. But (1,7) is '1', which is a number, so it's a safe square with one adjacent bomb.\n\nWait, (1,7) is '1', so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). Since (0,8) is '1' and (0,9) is 'F', maybe the bomb for (1,7) is elsewhere.\n\nBut perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me look for squares that can give me more information.\n\nLooking at row 7, (7,1) is '2', (7,2) is '2', (7,3) is '1', (7,4) is '1', (7,5) is '1'. So row 7 has several numbers. Let's focus on (7,3) which is '1'. Its adjacent squares must include exactly one bomb.\n\nThe adjacent squares to (7,3) are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). Since (7,3) is '1', only one of these can be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (7,2) which is '2', it's adjacent to (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). Since it's '2', it needs two bombs adjacent. But (7,3) is '1', so maybe one of the bombs is near (7,2). But this might be too vague.\n\nLet me look for a square that has a number and is surrounded by many unexplored squares. For example, (2,8) is '2', so it needs two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). But (1,7) is '1', which is a number, so it's safe. (1,8) is '.', which is unexplored, and (1,9) is '.' as well. So maybe (2,8) could have bombs at (1,8) and (1,9), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but (0,8) is '1', and (0,9) is 'F', so (0,8)'s adjacent squares are safe except for (0,9). So (1,8) and (1,9) should be safe because (0,8) only has one bomb. Therefore, (2,8) being '2' must have its two bombs elsewhere. Maybe (2,7) is '1', so it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (2,7) are (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). Since (1,7) is '1', which is safe, and (2,8) is '2', perhaps the bomb for (2,7) is at (3,7) or (3,8). But this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that's a '1' and has only one possible place for the bomb. For example, (3,0) is '1', so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is 'F', so that's the one bomb. Therefore, the other squares around (3,0) must be safe. So (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), and (4,1) are safe. That could help because if any of those squares are revealed, they should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is '1', which is adjacent to (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Since (3,0) is '1' and (2,0) is 'F', maybe (4,1) has its bomb somewhere else. But since (3,0) is '1' and (2,0) is a bomb, perhaps (4,1) has a bomb adjacent, maybe at (5,1) or (4,2). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the flags remaining. Since there are 7 flags left and 10 bombs in total, and 3 are already flagged, I need to place 7 more. But I have to make sure that placing a flag doesn't conflict with the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 9, I see that (9,1) is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (9,0) is '_', (9,1) is '1', (9,2) is '.'. Since (9,1) is '1', it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. Maybe (8,1) is a bomb? But (8,1) is '.'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (9,0) is a bomb, but it's currently '_', so it's unexplored. If I place a flag there, I have to check if it conflicts with (9,1)'s '1'. If (9,0) is a bomb, then (9,1)'s '1' is satisfied. But I can't be sure yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a square that is a '1' and has all its adjacent squares either revealed or flagged except one, which would be the bomb. For example, (3,4) is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, (3,4)'s '1' is satisfied by (2,3). So all other adjacent squares must be safe. So (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are safe. That could be useful information.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is '1'. Its adjacent squares include (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). Since (3,4) is '1', and (2,3) is 'F', maybe (4,3)'s bomb is elsewhere, but I'm not sure.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to find a square that can only be a bomb because all other possibilities are ruled out by the numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I should reveal a square that is likely to be safe based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 5, (5,1) is '1', (5,2) is '1', (5,3) is '1', (5,4) is '_', (5,5) is '1', (5,6) is '1', (5,7) is '2', (5,8) is '.', (5,9) is '.'.\n\nWait, (5,7) is '2', so it needs two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). Since (5,6) is '1', it's a safe square, so it must have one bomb adjacent. So (5,6)'s '1' could be satisfied by a bomb at (4,6) or (6,6), etc.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a '1' and has no other possible bombs, making it safe to reveal.\n\nFor example, (0,8) is '1' and (0,9) is 'F'. So (0,7) must be safe because (0,8) only has one bomb at (0,9). So revealing (0,7) would be safe. Let me check that.\n\n(0,7) is '.' so it's unexplored. If I reveal it, it should be safe because (0,8) is '1' and the only bomb is at (0,9). So revealing (0,7) would give me more information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should flag a square that is likely to be a bomb based on the numbers. For example, if a square is adjacent to multiple '1's, it's more likely to be a bomb.\n\nWait, (2,3) is 'F', so that's a bomb. (2,0) is 'F' as well. So those are accounted for.\n\nLooking at row 7 again, (7,0) is '_', (7,1) is '2', (7,2) is '2', (7,3) is '1', (7,4) is '1', (7,5) is '1', (7,6) is '.', (7,7) is '.', (7,8) is '.', (7,9) is '.'.\n\nSince (7,3) is '1', and its adjacent squares include (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). Maybe one of these is a bomb, but without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nI think the safest move right now is to reveal a square that is definitely safe based on the numbers. For example, (0,7) is adjacent to (0,8) which is '1' and (0,9) is 'F', so (0,7) must be safe. Revealing it would confirm that and might give me more numbers to work with.\n\nSo, I'll decide to reveal (0,7). That should be safe because (0,8) only has one bomb at (0,9), so (0,7) can't be a bomb.\n\nWait, but (0,7) is adjacent to (1,7) which is '1'. If (1,7) is '1', it has one bomb adjacent. If (0,7) is safe, then (1,7)'s bomb must be somewhere else, like (1,6) or (2,7), etc.\n\nBut I'm pretty confident that revealing (0,7) is safe because (0,8) is '1' and (0,9) is 'F', so (0,7) can't be a bomb. So I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (0,7) is safe because (0,8) is a '1' with a flag at (0,9), so (0,7) must be clear of bombs.\nMOVE: 0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current board state and see what information I can gather.\n\nFirst, I notice that the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has 7 flags remaining, which means they've already placed 3 flags. I see a few 'F's on the board, specifically at positions (0,8), (2,0), and (2,3). Wait, let me check that again. Looking at row 0, column 8 is 'F'. In row 2, column 0 is 'F' and column 3 is also 'F'. So that's three flags placed so far.\n\nNow, I need to check if any of these flags conflict with the revealed numbers. Let's go through each revealed number and see if the flags around them make sense.\n\nStarting from the top, row 0 has a '1' at (0,8). Wait, no, (0,8) is an 'F', so maybe I should look at the numbers around it. Wait, row 0, column 8 is '1' in the board state. Wait, no, looking again: the first line is \"0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\". So at (0,8) it's '1', and at (0,9) it's 'F'. So the '1' is at (0,8), which is a number, not a flag. So the 'F's are at (0,9), (2,0), and (2,3). Wait, no, the first line is row 0, columns 0 to 9. So (0,8) is '1' and (0,9) is 'F'. So that's one flag at (0,9). Then row 2 has 'F' at (2,0) and (2,3). So that's three flags.\n\nNow, looking at the numbers around these flags to see if there are any conflicts.\n\nStarting with the 'F' at (0,9). Let's see the surrounding squares. The square to the left is (0,8), which is '1'. Since (0,8) is a '1', it indicates that there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. Now, (0,8) is adjacent to (0,9), which is flagged. So that's one bomb accounted for. But does (0,8) have any other adjacent bombs? Let's check. The adjacent squares to (0,8) are:\n\n- (0,7): which is '_'\n- (0,9): 'F'\n- (1,7): '_'\n- (1,8): '_'\n- (1,9): '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, since (0,8) is '1' and it's adjacent to a flag at (0,9), that should be the only bomb. Therefore, none of the other adjacent squares to (0,8) can have a bomb. So the squares (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) should all be safe. But I don't see any numbers around (0,8) that would conflict, so that seems okay.\n\nNext, looking at the 'F' at (2,0). Let's check the surrounding squares. The square above it is (1,0), which is '1'. So (1,0) is a '1', meaning it has exactly one adjacent bomb. Since (2,0) is flagged, that's the one bomb. So the other adjacent squares to (1,0) can't have any bombs. Let's list them:\n\n- (0,0): '_'\n- (0,1): '_'\n- (1,1): '_'\n- (2,1): '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, (1,0) is '1' and is adjacent to (2,0) 'F', so the other adjacent squares should be safe. Therefore, no conflict here.\n\nNow, the 'F' at (2,3). Let's check the surrounding squares. The square above it is (1,3), which is '2'. So (1,3) is '2', meaning it has two bombs adjacent. Now, (2,3) is a flag, so that's one bomb. Therefore, there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to (1,3). Let's look at the adjacent squares to (1,3):\n\n- (0,2): '_'\n- (0,3): '_'\n- (0,4): '_'\n- (1,2): '_'\n- (1,4): '1'\n- (2,2): '_'\n- (2,3): 'F'\n- (2,4): '1'\n\nSo, (1,3) is '2' and has a flag at (2,3), so there must be one more bomb adjacent. Let's see which squares could have the other bomb. The squares adjacent to (1,3) that are revealed are:\n\n- (1,4): '1'\n- (2,4): '1'\n\nSo, (1,4) is '1' and (2,4) is '1'. Now, (1,4) is '1', so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Let's check the squares around (1,4):\n\n- (0,3): '_'\n- (0,4): '_'\n- (0,5): '_'\n- (1,3): '2'\n- (1,5): '_'\n- (2,3): 'F'\n- (2,4): '1'\n- (2,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, (1,4) is '1' and adjacent to (2,3) 'F' and (2,4) '1'. So, the bomb for (1,4) could be at (2,3), which is already a flag, so that's accounted for. Therefore, the other squares around (1,4) shouldn't have any bombs. But wait, (1,3) is '2' and has a flag at (2,3), so it needs one more bomb. The possible candidates are (1,2), (0,3), (0,4), (2,2), or (2,4). But (2,4) is '1', so if (2,4) is '1', it can only have one bomb adjacent. Let's look at (2,4):\n\n(2,4) is '1', so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,3): '2'\n- (1,4): '1'\n- (1,5): '_'\n- (2,3): 'F'\n- (2,5): '.' \n- (3,3): 'F' (Wait, (3,3) is '_'. Let me check again. Row 3, column 3 is '_', not 'F'. So, (2,4)'s adjacent squares are:\n\n(1,3): '2', (1,4): '1', (1,5): '_', (2,3): 'F', (2,5): '.', (3,3): '_', (3,4): '_', (3,5): '_'.\n\nSo, since (2,4) is '1' and adjacent to (2,3) 'F', that's the one bomb. Therefore, none of the other adjacent squares can have a bomb. So, the other squares around (1,3) must not have any bombs except (2,3). But (1,3) is '2', so where is the second bomb? Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, (1,3) is '2', and it's adjacent to (2,3) 'F' (one bomb). So, there must be another bomb somewhere else adjacent to (1,3). But looking at the other adjacent squares, (0,3) is '_', (0,4) is '_', (1,2) is '_', (1,4) is '1', (2,2) is '_', (2,4) is '1', and (2,3) is 'F'. \n\nWait, (1,4) is '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. Since (1,4) is adjacent to (2,3) 'F' and (2,4) '1', which is also a number, maybe the bomb for (1,4) is (2,3). So, that would mean that (1,3) must have another bomb somewhere else. But where? Because all other adjacent squares are either numbers or empty.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's look for other numbers that could give me clues.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0 is '1', which we've already checked. Row 1, column 4 is '1', and row 2, column 4 is '1'. Let me see if these can help.\n\nRow 2, column 4 is '1', so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,3): '2'\n- (1,4): '1'\n- (1,5): '_'\n- (2,3): 'F'\n- (2,5): '.' \n- (3,3): '_'\n- (3,4): '_'\n- (3,5): '_'\n\nSo, since (2,4) is '1' and adjacent to (2,3) 'F', that's the one bomb. Therefore, none of the other squares around (2,4) can have bombs.\n\nGoing back to (1,3) '2', which is adjacent to (2,3) 'F' (one bomb). So, the other bomb must be in one of the other adjacent squares. Let's see:\n\n- (0,3): '_'\n- (0,4): '_'\n- (1,2): '_'\n- (1,4): '1'\n- (2,2): '_'\n- (2,4): '1'\n\nBut (1,4) is '1' and (2,4) is '1', so their adjacent squares can't have bombs except where necessary. So, maybe the other bomb is at (0,3) or (0,4). But those are unrevealed. Alternatively, perhaps (1,2) or (2,2).\n\nWait, let's check (1,2). It's '_', so it's either a bomb or a number. If (1,2) is a bomb, then (1,3) would have two bombs: (2,3) and (1,2). That would satisfy (1,3) being '2'. But let's see if that's possible without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nIf (1,2) is a bomb, then let's check the squares around it. The adjacent squares to (1,2) would be:\n\n- (0,1): '_'\n- (0,2): '_'\n- (0,3): '_'\n- (1,1): '_'\n- (1,3): '2'\n- (2,1): '.' \n- (2,2): '_'\n- (2,3): 'F'\n\nSo, if (1,2) is a bomb, then (0,2) would have to account for it. Let's check (0,2). It's '_', so it's either a bomb or a number. If (0,2) is a number, say '1', then it would have one bomb adjacent. But (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). If (1,2) is a bomb, then (0,2) would have at least one bomb adjacent. But (0,2) is '_', so it could be a number or a bomb. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other bomb is at (0,4). Let's check (0,4). It's '_', so if it's a bomb, then the adjacent squares would have to reflect that. For example, (0,3) would have to account for it if it's a number. But (0,3) is '_', so it could be a number or a bomb.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for other numbers that can give me more clues.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 1 is '2'. So (3,1) is '2', meaning it has two bombs adjacent. Let's see where those could be. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,0): 'F'\n- (2,1): '.' \n- (2,2): '_'\n- (3,0): '_'\n- (3,2): '.' \n- (4,0): '_'\n- (4,1): '_'\n- (4,2): '.' \n\nSo, (3,1) is '2' and adjacent to (2,0) 'F' (one bomb). So, there must be another bomb adjacent. The possible squares are (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 1 is '1'. So (4,1) is '1', meaning it has exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (3,0): '_'\n- (3,1): '2'\n- (3,2): '.' \n- (4,0): '_'\n- (4,2): '.' \n- (5,0): '_'\n- (5,1): '_'\n- (5,2): '.' \n\nSo, (4,1) is '1' and adjacent to (3,1) '2' and other squares. Since (3,1) is '2', it has two bombs, one of which is (2,0) 'F'. So, the other bomb for (3,1) must be somewhere else. But (4,1) is '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. That bomb could be (3,1)'s second bomb, but (3,1) is a number, not a bomb. Wait, no, (3,1) is a number, so it's not a bomb itself. So, the bombs adjacent to (3,1) must be in the surrounding squares. So, one is (2,0) 'F', and another must be somewhere else. But (4,1) is '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. So, the other bomb adjacent to (3,1) can't be adjacent to (4,1). Therefore, the other bomb must be in (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), etc., but not adjacent to (4,1). Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider placing a flag somewhere else, but I have to be careful not to conflict with the numbers. Alternatively, I could try revealing a square that's likely to be safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 7 is '_', which is adjacent to (0,8) '1'. Since (0,8) is '1' and adjacent to (0,9) 'F', which is a bomb, then (0,7) must be safe because (0,8) can't have more than one bomb. So, revealing (0,7) would be safe.\n\nWait, but (0,7) is '_', so it's either a number or a bomb. But since (0,8) is '1' and adjacent to (0,9) 'F', (0,7) must be safe because (0,8) can't have more than one bomb. Therefore, revealing (0,7) would be a good move because it's definitely safe and might reveal a number that could help with further deductions.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for other safe squares. For example, row 1, column 7 is '_', which is adjacent to (0,8) '1'. Since (0,8) is '1' and has a flag at (0,9), (1,7) must be safe. So, revealing (1,7) would also be safe.\n\nBut perhaps (0,7) is a better choice because it's in the top row and might reveal more numbers that can help.\n\nWait, another thought: since (0,8) is '1' and adjacent to (0,9) 'F', then (0,7) must be safe. So, revealing (0,7) would be a safe move. Let me consider that.\n\nSo, the next move would be to reveal (0,7), which is safe because (0,8) can't have more than one bomb. This would help me see what's there, potentially revealing a number that could give more clues about the surrounding squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check other areas. For example, in row 7, column 1 is '1', so (7,1) is '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (6,0): '_'\n- (6,1): '_'\n- (6,2): '_'\n- (7,0): '_'\n- (7,2): '2'\n- (8,0): '_'\n- (8,1): '_'\n- (8,2): '.' \n\nSo, (7,1) is '1' and has one bomb adjacent. Since (7,2) is '2', which is a number, the bomb could be in one of the other squares. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nI think the safest move right now is to reveal (0,7), as it's guaranteed to be safe based on (0,8) being '1' and adjacent to a flag. So, let's go with that.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (0,7) is safe because (0,8) is '1' and adjacent to a flag at (0,9), meaning (0,7) cannot have a bomb. This move provides more information without risk.\n\nMOVE: 0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 F . .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. It's a 10x10 grid with some numbers, flags, and empty spaces. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. There are 10 bombs in total and 7 flags remaining, so I need to be careful where I place them.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the revealed numbers to see if any obvious conflicts exist with the current flags. Let's go row by row.\n\nLooking at row 0: There's a 1 at position (0,8) and an F at (0,9). The 1 means there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares to (0,8) would be (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), and (1,8). Since (0,9) is flagged, that could be the one bomb. But I need to check if there's another bomb nearby. Wait, (0,7) is revealed as 1, so that might complicate things. Hmm, maybe I should look elsewhere for now.\n\nRow 1 has a lot of numbers: 1s at (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). That's a lot of 1s. Let me focus on (1,0). It's a 1, so it has one adjacent bomb. The adjacent squares would be (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0). (1,1) is a 1, which is already revealed, so maybe the bomb is in (0,0) or (2,0). But (0,0) is empty, so perhaps (2,0) is the bomb, but (2,0) is an F. Wait, (2,0) is flagged as F, so that would satisfy the 1 at (1,0). That seems okay.\n\nMoving to row 2: There's an F at (2,0), which I just considered. Then at (2,3) and (2,4), there are Fs. Let's check (2,4), which is an F. The adjacent squares would include (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (1,4) is a 1, so if (2,4) is a bomb, does that conflict? (1,4) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (2,4) is a bomb, then (1,4) should have only that one bomb. But I'm not sure about the other squares around (1,4). This might not be a conflict yet.\n\nRow 3 has a 1 at (3,0), a 2 at (3,1), and so on. Let me check (3,1) which is a 2. It has two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares include (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) is an F, so that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb nearby. Maybe (4,0) or (3,2) or (2,2). Not sure yet.\n\nRow 4: (4,1) is a 1, (4,3) is a 1, and (4,6) is a 1. Let's take (4,1). It's a 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0) is a 1, which is already counted, but (3,1) is a 2. Maybe the bomb is at (5,1), which is a 1, but that's a number, not a bomb. Hmm, perhaps (4,0) is a bomb? But (4,0) is empty. Not sure.\n\nRow 5: (5,1) is a 1, (5,2) is a 1, (5,5) is a 1. Let's check (5,1). It's a 1, so it needs one bomb nearby. The adjacent squares include (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,1) is a 1, so maybe the bomb is at (5,0) or (6,1). Not sure.\n\nRow 6: (6,5) is a 1. Let's see. Its adjacent squares include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,5) is a 1, which is already a number, so maybe the bomb is at (7,5) or (6,4). Not sure.\n\nRow 7: (7,1) is a 2, (7,2) is a 2, (7,4) is a 1. Let's look at (7,1): it's a 2, so two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (7,2) is a 2, which is another number. So maybe the bombs are at (6,1) and (8,1). But (6,1) is a 1, which is a number, so that can't be a bomb. Hmm, maybe (7,0) or (8,0). Not sure.\n\nRow 8: (8,1) is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,1) is a 2, so if (8,1) is a 1, maybe the bomb is at (7,0) or (9,1). Not sure.\n\nRow 9: (9,1) is a 1. Its adjacent squares include (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). Maybe the bomb is at (8,1) or (9,0). But (8,1) is a 1, so that's a number, not a bomb.\n\nNow, considering the flags remaining: 7. There are already some flags on the board. Let me count them. Looking through the board, I see Fs at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5). Wait, no, looking back, the board state shows:\n\nRow 0: ... F at (0,9)\nRow 2: F at (2,0), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: F at (3,5)\nRow 4: F at (4,5)\nRow 5: F at (5,5)\nRow 6: F at (6,5)\nRow 7: F at (7,5)\n\nWait, that's more than 7. Let me recount. The initial flags remaining are 7, but I see multiple Fs on the board. Maybe I miscounted. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) is F\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,3), (2,4) \u2192 3 Fs\nRow 3: (3,5) is F\nRow 4: (4,5) is F\nRow 5: (5,5) is F\nRow 6: (6,5) is F\nRow 7: (7,5) is F\n\nThat's 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 Fs. But the game info says flags remaining:7. That suggests that there are 7 flags placed, but I count 9 Fs. That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the board. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking back, the board state shows:\n\nRow 0: ... F at (0,9)\nRow 2: F at (2,0), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: F at (3,5)\nRow 4: F at (4,5)\nRow 5: F at (5,5)\nRow 6: F at (6,5)\nRow 7: F at (7,5)\n\nSo that's 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 Fs. But the game info says flags remaining:7, which probably means that 7 flags are left to place, implying that 3 have been used so far. Wait, no, in Minesweeper, the number of flags remaining usually refers to how many you can still place. So if there are 10 bombs and 7 flags remaining, that means 3 flags have been placed so far. But according to the board, I see more than 3 Fs. So maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking again: in row 0, (0,9) is F. Row 2: (2,0), (2,3), (2,4) \u2192 3 Fs. Row 3: (3,5). Row 4: (4,5). Row 5: (5,5). Row 6: (6,5). Row 7: (7,5). That's 1 +3 +1+1+1+1+1= 9 Fs. But the game info says flags remaining:7. That suggests that 3 flags have been placed, but the board shows 9 Fs. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the board. Maybe some of those are not Fs. Let me re-examine the board state:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 F . . F 1 _ _ 1 2 .\n3 1 2 . 2 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n7 _ 1 2 2 1 1 . . . .\n8 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n9 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, I think I misread some. Let me list each row's Fs:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) is F \u2192 1\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,3), (2,4) \u2192 3\nRow 3: (3,5) \u21921\nRow 4: (4,5) \u21921\nRow 5: (5,5) \u21921\nRow 6: (6,5) \u21921\nRow 7: (7,5) \u21921\n\nThat's 1+3+1+1+1+1+1= 9 Fs. But the game info says flags remaining:7, which likely means that 3 flags have been used, leaving 7. So perhaps the board has 3 Fs, not 9. I must have misread the board.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps some of the Fs are actually numbers or other symbols. Let me check:\n\nRow 0: ... F at (0,9)\nRow 2: F at (2,0), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: (3,5) is F\nRow 4: (4,5) is F\nRow 5: (5,5) is F\nRow 6: (6,5) is F\nRow 7: (7,5) is F\n\nWait, that's 9 Fs. But the game info says flags remaining:7, implying only 3 have been placed. So there must be a misunderstanding. Maybe the 'F's are not all flags. Wait, the legend says F is a flagged space. So perhaps the board has 9 Fs, but the game info says flags remaining:7, meaning that the player has 7 flags left to place, implying that 3 have been used. But the board shows 9 Fs, which is more than the total bombs (10). That can't be right because you can't have more flags than bombs. So I must have miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the board has fewer Fs. Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) \u21921\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,3), (2,4) \u21923\nRow 3: (3,5) \u21921\nRow 4: (4,5) \u21921\nRow 5: (5,5) \u21921\nRow 6: (6,5) \u21921\nRow 7: (7,5) \u21921\n\nThat's 1+3+1+1+1+1+1=9 Fs. But the game info says flags remaining:7, which suggests that only 3 are placed, leaving 7. So perhaps the board has only 3 Fs, and the rest are something else. Maybe I misread some as Fs when they are numbers or other symbols.\n\nLooking again at row 3: (3,5) is F. Row 4: (4,5) is F. Row 5: (5,5) is F. Row 6: (6,5) is F. Row 7: (7,5) is F. So that's 5 Fs in rows 3-7, plus row 0 and 2: 1+3=4, total 9. This is confusing. Maybe the initial board state was miswritten.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'F's are part of the numbers, like 1F or something, but that doesn't make sense. I think I need to proceed assuming that the number of flags is 7 remaining, so I can place up to 7. But perhaps I should focus on other aspects.\n\nLet me think about the numbers and see if any conflicts exist. For example, if a square with a 1 has two flags adjacent, that's a conflict. Let me check each number.\n\nLooking at (0,8) which is 1. Its adjacent squares include (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8). (0,9) is F, so that's one bomb. (0,7) is 1, which is another number, so no conflict.\n\nLooking at (1,0) which is 1. Its adjacent squares include (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0). (2,0) is F, so that's one bomb, which is fine.\n\n(1,1) is 1. Adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (2,0) is F, so that's one bomb, which is correct.\n\n(1,2) is 2. Adjacent squares include (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (2,3) is F, so that's one bomb. Since it's a 2, there should be another bomb nearby. So perhaps (0,3) is a bomb, but (0,3) is empty. Or maybe (1,3) is a bomb, but (1,3) is 2, which is a number. Hmm, maybe (2,2) is a bomb.\n\nWait, (1,2) is a 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. One is at (2,3), so another must be nearby. Let's check (2,2) and (0,2). (0,2) is empty, (2,2) is empty. So maybe (1,3) is a bomb? But (1,3) is 2, which is a number. That can't be. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, (1,2) is 2, so two bombs adjacent. One is at (2,3). The other could be at (2,1) or (0,2). But (2,1) is empty, (0,2) is empty. So maybe (1,3) is a bomb? But (1,3) is 2, which is a number. So that can't be. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe (1,2) is 2, and one bomb is at (2,3), and another at (2,1). But (2,1) is empty. Maybe (1,1) is a bomb, but (1,1) is 1, which is a number. So this is confusing. Maybe (1,2)'s second bomb is at (2,2). But (2,2) is empty.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a square where placing a flag would satisfy a number's requirement.\n\nLooking at row 7, (7,1) is 2. It needs two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (7,2) is 2, which is another number. So perhaps the bombs are at (6,1) and (8,1). But (6,1) is 1, which is a number, so that can't be a bomb. So maybe (7,0) and (8,0). But (7,0) is empty, (8,0) is empty. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (7,1)'s bombs are at (6,2) and (8,2). But (6,2) is empty, (8,2) is empty.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a number that can only have one possible bomb placement.\n\nLooking at (5,5) which is F. Let's check the adjacent squares. (5,5) is F, so it's a bomb. The adjacent squares would include (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (4,5) is F, so that's another bomb. So (5,5) being a bomb would affect the numbers around it.\n\nWait, (4,5) is F, so that's a bomb. Let's check the number at (4,6) which is 1. Its adjacent squares include (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). (4,5) is F, so that's one bomb. (5,5) is F, so that's another bomb. But (4,6) is 1, which can only have one bomb adjacent. So if both (4,5) and (5,5) are bombs, that would make (4,6) have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts the 1. Therefore, either (4,5) or (5,5) is not a bomb, but both are flagged. That's a problem.\n\nSo, this suggests that there's a conflict between (4,5) and (5,5) being flags because (4,6) is a 1, which can only have one bomb adjacent. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrect. Since both are flagged, but they are adjacent to a 1, which can only have one bomb, this is a conflict.\n\nSo, I should consider removing one of these flags. But which one? Let's see.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (4,5), then (5,5) remains as a flag. Then, (4,6) would have only (5,5) as a bomb, which is okay because it's a 1. Alternatively, if I remove (5,5), then (4,5) remains, and (4,6) would have only (4,5) as a bomb, which is also okay.\n\nBut which one is more likely to be a bomb? Let's look at the numbers around them.\n\nLooking at (5,5): it's F, so if it's a bomb, it affects the numbers around it. For example, (5,4) is 1, which would have to have exactly one bomb adjacent. If (5,5) is a bomb, then (5,4)'s 1 would be satisfied by (5,5). Similarly, (5,6) is 2, which would have bombs at (5,5) and perhaps another.\n\nBut (5,5) is also adjacent to (4,5), which is F. So if both are bombs, that's a problem for (4,6). Therefore, one of them must not be a bomb, but since both are flagged, I have to remove one.\n\nGiven that, I think it's better to remove the flag at (5,5) because (5,5) is also adjacent to (5,6) which is 2, which might need another bomb elsewhere. Whereas (4,5) is adjacent to (4,6) which is 1, which can only have one bomb, so keeping (4,5) as a flag would satisfy (4,6)'s requirement.\n\nTherefore, I should remove the flag at (5,5). So my next move would be to reveal (5,5) by removing the flag, but wait, in Minesweeper, you can't remove a flag by revealing; you have to flag again. So to remove a flag, you have to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\n\nWait, no, according to the rules, to remove a flag, you make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So if I want to remove the flag at (5,5), I would send a move with (5,5, true). But that would toggle the flag. However, if (5,5) is actually a bomb, then revealing it would cause a game over. But since I'm trying to remove the flag, I have to consider that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag elsewhere to satisfy the numbers. But I think the conflict between (4,5) and (5,5) is critical, so I should address that.\n\nSo, the move would be to remove the flag at (5,5) by sending (5,5,true). But I'm not sure if that's the best move because it might be a bomb. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that can help clarify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a square that, when revealed, would give me more information. For example, (5,5) is F, but if I could reveal a square adjacent to it, I might find out if it's a bomb or not.\n\nBut considering the conflict, I think the best move is to remove the flag at (5,5) to resolve the conflict with (4,6)'s 1. So I'll make that move.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The flag at (5,5) conflicts with the number 1 at (4,6), which can only have one adjacent bomb. Since both (4,5) and (5,5) are flagged, causing (4,6) to have two adjacent bombs, I need to remove one. Removing (5,5) resolves this conflict.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,true", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 F . .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the information given.\n\nThe board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 6 flags remaining, which means I can place 6 more flags. The board has some numbers and some flagged squares already. My goal is to either reveal all the safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs without hitting any.\n\nFirst, I should check all the revealed numbers against the existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. For example, if a '1' has two adjacent flags, that's a problem because it can only have one bomb nearby. Similarly, a '2' with only one flag next to it must have another bomb somewhere else nearby.\n\nLooking at the board, I see several numbers. Let's go row by row.\n\nIn row 0, there's a 1 at (0,8) and an F at (0,9). So, the 1 at (0,8) must have exactly one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares would be (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), and (1,8). Since (0,9) is flagged, that's one bomb accounted for. Therefore, the 1 at (0,8) is satisfied because it only needs one bomb. So, no conflict here.\n\nIn row 1, there are 1s at (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (1,8), and (1,9). Wait, actually, looking again, (1,0) is 1, (1,1) is 1, (1,2) is 2, (1,5) is 1, (1,8) is 1, and (1,9) is 1. Hmm, so (1,2) is a 2, which means it has two bombs adjacent. Let's see where those could be.\n\nThe 2 at (1,2) is adjacent to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), and (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). But (0,3) is a 2, which I'll get to in a minute. So, maybe the bombs near (1,2) are in some of these squares. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 2, there are Fs at (2,0) and (2,3), and a 1 at (2,4). So the 1 at (2,4) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares include (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), and (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Since (2,3) is flagged, that's one bomb, so the 1 is satisfied.\n\nIn row 3, there's a 1 at (3,0), a 2 at (3,2), a 2 at (3,4), and a 1 at (3,8). Let's look at the 2 at (3,2). It needs two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Since (2,3) is flagged, that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb somewhere else around here.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 at (3,4) needs two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is flagged, so that's one bomb. So another bomb must be nearby.\n\nIn row 4, there's a 1 at (4,1), a 1 at (4,3), a 1 at (4,7), and a 2 at (4,8). The 2 at (4,8) needs two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (3,9) is a 1, but I'm not sure about the others.\n\nRow 5 has a 1 at (5,1), a 1 at (5,2), a 1 at (5,5), and a 2 at (5,7). The 2 at (5,7) needs two bombs nearby. Its adjacent squares are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (4,7) is a 1, so that might be one, but I'm not sure.\n\nRow 6 has a 1 at (6,5). So the adjacent squares must include exactly one bomb. The adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,5) is a 1, which might be the bomb, but I'm not certain.\n\nRow 7 has a 1 at (7,1), a 2 at (7,2), and a 2 at (7,4). The 2 at (7,2) needs two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (7,1) is a 1, which might be one bomb, so another must be nearby.\n\nThe 2 at (7,4) needs two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). Not sure about these yet.\n\nRow 8 has a 1 at (8,1). So the adjacent squares must have exactly one bomb. The adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,1) is a 1, which might be the bomb, but I'm not certain.\n\nRow 9 has a 1 at (9,1). Adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). Not sure about these.\n\nNow, I should look for obvious conflicts. For example, if a '1' has two flags adjacent, that's a problem. But looking through the numbers, I don't see any immediate conflicts. So maybe I can look for places where I can place a flag without conflicting with the numbers.\n\nI have 6 flags remaining, and there are 10 bombs in total. So I need to find where to place these flags. But I should also consider that some squares might be safe to reveal, which would help me narrow down the bomb locations.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that (0,8) is a 1, and (0,9) is flagged. So the 1 at (0,8) is satisfied by the flag at (0,9). That means the other adjacent squares around (0,8) should be safe. So (0,7) and (1,7), (1,8) must be safe because the only bomb is at (0,9). So I can maybe reveal those squares if I want, but since they are unexplored, I might not need to yet.\n\nLooking at row 1, the 2 at (1,2) needs two bombs. The adjacent squares include (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,3) is a 2, which might be a bomb, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, (0,3) is a 2, which means it's a number, not a bomb. So the bombs must be in the adjacent squares.\n\nWait, (0,3) is a 2, so it must have two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). So the 2 at (0,3) needs two bombs in these squares.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 at (1,2) needs two bombs in its adjacent squares. So maybe some of these squares have bombs.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a number that can only have one possible bomb location.\n\nFor example, the 1 at (2,4) has a flag at (2,3), so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares around (2,4) must be safe. So (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) should be safe. But (1,5) is a 1, so that might be a bomb, but wait, no, (1,5) is a 1, meaning it has one bomb adjacent. So if (2,4) is a 1, and it's already satisfied by (2,3), then (1,5) must have its own bomb somewhere else.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of a different approach.\n\nI have 6 flags left, and 10 bombs. So I need to find 6 more bombs to flag. But I also have to be careful not to place a flag where a number indicates there can't be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,0) is empty, but it's at the top-left corner. Maybe I can check if it's safe. But without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, looking at row 7, there's a 2 at (7,2) and a 2 at (7,4). The 2 at (7,2) needs two bombs adjacent. Let's see, the adjacent squares are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (7,1) is a 1, which might be a bomb. If I place a flag at (7,1), that would satisfy the 1, but then the 2 at (7,2) would still need another bomb. So maybe (6,2) or (8,2) could be bombs.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a number that can only have one possible bomb left.\n\nAnother approach: check the numbers and see if any of them have all their adjacent squares explored except one, which must be a bomb. For example, if a 1 has all adjacent squares revealed except one, that square must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any such obvious cases. So maybe I need to look for a square that's adjacent to a number and hasn't been explored yet, and place a flag there if it's possible without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reveal a square that's adjacent to a number and see if it's safe. For example, the square at (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1) and (1,0) and (1,1). (1,0) is a 1, so if I reveal (0,0), it might help me figure out if it's safe or if it's a bomb.\n\nBut revealing a square could be risky because if it's a bomb, the game ends. So I should only reveal squares that are likely safe based on the numbers.\n\nWait, the square at (0,0) is adjacent to (1,0), which is a 1. If I reveal (0,0) and it's a 1, that would mean there's a bomb adjacent to it. But I don't know where. Alternatively, if it's a 0, that would mean all surrounding squares are safe.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to decide. So maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 5, (5,5) is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). If I can figure out where the bomb is around here, maybe I can place a flag.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9, (9,1) is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). If I could reveal one of these, maybe I can find a bomb.\n\nWait, but I have to be careful. Revealing a square could be a bomb, which would end the game. So I should only reveal squares that are likely safe.\n\nMaybe I can look for a square that's adjacent to a 1 and all other adjacent squares are either revealed or flagged, making this square the only possible bomb location.\n\nFor example, looking at (0,8), which is a 1, and (0,9) is flagged. So the other adjacent squares, like (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), must be safe. So revealing (0,7) might be safe. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place a flag somewhere. Let's see, I have 6 flags left. I need to place them where the numbers allow.\n\nLooking at the 2 at (3,2), which needs two bombs. The adjacent squares include (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,3) is flagged, so that's one bomb. So I need another bomb here. Maybe (4,1) is a bomb? But (4,1) is a 1, which is a number, not a bomb. Wait, no, (4,1) is a 1, meaning it's a revealed square with a number. So it can't be a bomb. So the other bomb must be somewhere else around (3,2). Maybe (3,3) or (4,2).\n\nBut I can't place a flag on (3,3) because it's a number. So maybe (4,2) is a bomb. But I don't know for sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit too complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a number and hasn't been explored yet, and place a flag there if possible.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,0) is unexplored. It's adjacent to (1,0), which is a 1. If (0,0) is a bomb, then (1,0) would have one bomb, which is satisfied. But I don't know if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, (6,0) is unexplored. It's adjacent to (5,0), which is unexplored, and (6,1), which is unexplored, and (7,0), which is unexplored. Not helpful.\n\nWait, looking at row 7, (7,0) is unexplored. It's adjacent to (6,0), (7,1), and (8,0). (7,1) is a 1, so if (7,0) is a bomb, that would satisfy (7,1)'s count. But I don't know.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a square that's adjacent to a number which can only have one possible bomb location.\n\nLooking back at (0,3), which is a 2. Its adjacent squares are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). So it needs two bombs in these squares. (1,2) is a 2, which needs two bombs, so maybe one of them is in (0,2) or (0,4). But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place a flag at (0,0). But I'm not sure if that's a bomb. If I place a flag there and it's not a bomb, I'm wasting a flag. If it is a bomb, then that's correct. But without knowing, it's risky.\n\nWait, another approach: the total number of bombs is 10. I have 6 flags left, so I need to find 6 more bombs. But I also have to consider that some squares are already revealed as numbers, so they can't be bombs.\n\nLooking at the board, how many bombs have I already flagged? Let's see. I see Fs at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (5,5). So that's 4 flags. Wait, the game info says flags remaining: 6. So I've used 4 flags, and can place 6 more? Wait, no, the total bombs are 10, so if I've already placed 4 flags, I have 6 left to place. So I need to place 6 more flags.\n\nWait, but the board shows F at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (5,5). So that's 4 flags. So I can place 6 more. So I need to find 6 more bombs.\n\nBut I have to be careful where I place them.\n\nLooking at the board, I can try to find squares that are adjacent to numbers that require a bomb there.\n\nFor example, the 1 at (3,0) needs exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is flagged, so that's one bomb, satisfying the 1. So the other adjacent squares must be safe. So (3,1) is a 1, which is a number, so it's safe. (4,1) is a 1, which is also a number. So that's okay.\n\nAnother example: the 1 at (4,1) is a number. It needs one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. (4,0) is unexplored, but (5,0) is unexplored. So maybe the bomb is at (5,0) or (4,2).\n\nBut I don't know for sure. This is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a 1 and all other possible bomb locations are already flagged or revealed, so this square must be a bomb.\n\nFor example, looking at (0,8) is a 1, and (0,9) is flagged. So the other adjacent squares must be safe. So (0,7) is safe, (1,7) is safe, (1,8) is a 1, which is a number. So no conflict there.\n\nAnother idea: look for a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, which together indicate that it must be a bomb.\n\nFor example, if a square is adjacent to two different numbers, each requiring a bomb, then that square must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (1,2), which is a 2, and (0,3), which is a 2. The square (1,3) is adjacent to both. If (1,3) is a bomb, it would satisfy both (1,2) and (0,3). So maybe (1,3) is a bomb.\n\nBut I can't be sure without more information.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (3,2) which is a 2, and (3,4) which is a 2. The square (3,3) is adjacent to both. If (3,3) is a bomb, it would satisfy both. So maybe (3,3) is a bomb.\n\nBut again, I'm not certain.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should make a move that's less risky, like revealing a square that's adjacent to a 1, which is more likely to be safe.\n\nLooking at (0,7), which is adjacent to (0,8), a 1. Since (0,9) is flagged, (0,7) must be safe. So revealing (0,7) would be safe.\n\nBut wait, (0,7) is unexplored, and (0,8) is a 1 with a flag at (0,9). So (0,7) is safe. So I can reveal it.\n\nBut the problem is, I don't know if it's a number or not. If I reveal it and it's a number, that could help me. If it's a 0, then I can reveal more squares around it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere else.\n\nWait, another approach: count the number of bombs that must be in certain areas based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, the 2 at (0,3) needs two bombs in its adjacent squares. Let's see, (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). So two of these must be bombs.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 at (1,2) needs two bombs in its adjacent squares: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). So two bombs here.\n\nBut (0,3) is a 2, so it needs two bombs. So perhaps one of them is in (1,2)'s area.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. I think I need to make a move based on the information I have.\n\nSince I have 6 flags left, I should look for squares that are likely to be bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at (5,5), which is a 1. Its adjacent squares include (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). If I can find a square here that must be a bomb, I can flag it.\n\nBut I don't see any obvious choices. Maybe I can flag (5,5) if it's a bomb, but since it's a 1, it's a number, not a bomb. So I can't flag it.\n\nWait, no, (5,5) is a 1, meaning it's a number, not a bomb. So I can't flag it. I have to flag a square that's unexplored.\n\nLooking at (5,5)'s adjacent squares, maybe (6,5) is a bomb. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (7,2), which is a 2. Its adjacent squares include (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). If I can find two bombs here, but I don't know where.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should reveal a square that's adjacent to a 1 to get more information.\n\nLooking at (0,7), which is adjacent to (0,8), a 1. Since (0,9) is flagged, (0,7) must be safe. So I can reveal it.\n\nBut I don't know if it's a number or not. If it's a number, that could help me. If it's a 0, I can reveal more squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (1,7), which is adjacent to (0,8), a 1. Since (0,9) is flagged, (1,7) must be safe.\n\nBut again, I don't know what's there.\n\nWait, another idea: the square at (3,8) is a 1. Its adjacent squares include (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). (2,8) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. (2,9) is unexplored, but (3,9) is unexplored. (4,8) is a 2, which is a number. So maybe the bomb is at (4,9) or (3,7).\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nI think I've exhausted my options in terms of analysis. Maybe I should place a flag somewhere that's likely to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at (5,5), which is a 1. Its adjacent squares must include one bomb. Maybe (5,6) is a bomb. So I can flag (5,6).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe (6,5) is a bomb.\n\nWait, but I don't have enough information. Maybe I should flag (5,6) as a possible bomb.\n\nBut I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe I can flag (6,5).\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9, (9,1) is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). If I can find a square here that must be a bomb, I can flag it.\n\nBut I don't have enough information.\n\nI think I'll go with flagging (5,6) as a possible bomb. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal (0,7) to get more info.\n\nWait, since (0,7) is adjacent to a 1 and a flag, it must be safe. So I can reveal it without risk.\n\nSo, I'll reveal (0,7). If it's a number, I can use that info to find more bombs. If it's a 0, I can reveal more squares around it.\n\nSo, the move would be to reveal (0,7).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (0,7) is safe because the adjacent 1 at (0,8) is already satisfied by the flag at (0,9), so (0,7) must be safe. Revealing it provides more information about the board without risk.\n\nMOVE: 0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the current board state and see where I can get some clues. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. There are 6 flags remaining, so I can place up to 6 more flags if needed.\n\nLooking at the board, I see several numbers and some flagged squares (marked with F). My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. Since the game ends if I reveal a bomb, I have to be careful where I click.\n\nLet me start by checking the revealed numbers and see if any of them conflict with the existing flags. For example, if a square with a '1' has two adjacent flags, that would be a conflict because it can only have one bomb nearby. Similarly, a '2' with only one adjacent flag must have another bomb somewhere else nearby.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is a '1', and it's adjacent to a flag at (0,9). But wait, (0,9) is an 'F', so that's a flagged square. So the '1' at (0,8) should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (0,9) is flagged, that's one bomb accounted for. Now, I should check the other adjacent squares around (0,8) to see if there could be another bomb, which would make the count incorrect.\n\nThe square at (0,8) is adjacent to (0,7), which is a '.', (1,7), which is '.', (1,8), which is '1', and (1,9), which is '.'. So, since (0,9) is already flagged, the '1' at (0,8) is satisfied. There shouldn't be another bomb adjacent to (0,8). So, that seems okay.\n\nNext, let's look at row 1, column 0, which is a '1'. It's adjacent to (0,0), which is '_', (0,1), which is '_', (1,1), which is '1', and (2,0), which is 'F'. So, the '1' at (1,0) has a flag at (2,0), so that's one bomb. It shouldn't have any other bombs adjacent. So, the squares around (1,0) should not have any other bombs. That seems okay.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 1, which is a '1', adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), and (2,1). There's a flag at (2,0), which is one bomb. So, the '1' at (1,1) is satisfied by that flag. No other bombs should be adjacent.\n\nRow 1, column 2 is a '2'. It's adjacent to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), and (2,2). There's a flag at (2,0), but that's two squares away. So, the '2' at (1,2) must have two bombs adjacent. I don't see any flags near it except maybe (2,0), which is too far. So, perhaps there are two bombs somewhere around it, but I don't have enough info yet.\n\nMoving on to row 2, column 0 is an 'F'. That's a flag, so that's one bomb accounted for. The square at (2,3) is an 'F' as well. So, that's another bomb. So far, I see two flags, so 8 bombs remain.\n\nRow 3, column 0 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (2,0) which is an 'F', so that's one bomb. The '1' is satisfied, so no other bombs should be adjacent to (3,0).\n\nRow 4, column 1 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (3,0), which is '1', (3,1), which is '2', (3,2), which is '.', (4,0), which is '_', (4,2), which is '.', and (5,1), which is '1'. So, the '1' at (4,1) needs exactly one bomb adjacent. I don't see any flags nearby except maybe (2,0) or (2,3), but they're too far. So, perhaps there's a bomb somewhere around (4,1) that I can't see yet.\n\nRow 5, column 5 is an 'F'. That's another flag, so that's three bombs accounted for. So, 7 bombs remain.\n\nNow, looking at row 7, columns 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Row 7, column 1 is '1', column 2 is '2', column 3 is '2', column 4 is '1', and column 5 is '1'. This seems like a cluster with several numbers. Let me see if I can find any conflicts here.\n\nThe '1' at (7,1) is adjacent to (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), and (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). There are no flags nearby, so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Similarly, the '2' at (7,2) needs two bombs nearby. The '2' at (7,3) also needs two bombs nearby. The '1's at (7,4) and (7,5) each need one bomb.\n\nThis area might be a good place to look for potential flags because the numbers are lower, and there might be some constraints.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 5 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), and (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). No flags nearby, so exactly one bomb is around here.\n\nI think I should look for areas where the numbers might be conflicting with existing flags or where placing a flag would satisfy a number.\n\nWait, looking back at row 0, column 9 is an 'F', which is a flag. The square at (0,8) is a '1', which is adjacent to (0,9). So, that '1' is satisfied. Now, looking at (0,7), which is a '.', maybe I can reveal that to see if it's a number or not. If it's a number, it might help me figure out where the bombs are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's surrounded by numbers which can only be satisfied by placing a flag there. For example, if a '1' is next to a square that's the only possible location for a bomb, I can flag it.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 1 is a '2'. It's adjacent to (2,0) which is an 'F', so that's one bomb. So, the '2' at (3,1) needs another bomb adjacent. The possible squares are (2,1), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). But (3,0) is a '1', so it can't have another bomb. (2,1) is '.', (4,1) is '1', which already needs one bomb. So, perhaps the other bomb is at (2,1) or (3,2). But I don't have enough info yet.\n\nAnother approach: since there are 10 bombs and I've already placed 3 flags (at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (5,5)), wait, no, looking back, the flags are at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (5,5). So that's four flags, meaning there are 6 bombs remaining.\n\nWait, the game info says Flags remaining: 6, so I can place 6 more flags. Wait, no, the game info says Flags remaining: 6, which probably means I have 6 flags left to place, so I've already placed 4 (since 10 bombs total, and 6 flags remaining, so 10 - 6 = 4 flags placed). So, I've placed 4 flags so far.\n\nWait, looking at the board, I see F at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), and (5,5). That's four Fs, so yes, 4 flags placed, 6 remaining.\n\nSo, I have 6 more flags I can place. So, I can afford to place more flags if needed.\n\nNow, looking for squares where placing a flag would satisfy a number. For example, if a '1' is next to a square that must be a bomb, I can flag it.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5 is an 'F', so that's a bomb. The square at (5,5) is adjacent to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). So, any numbers around here might be affected by this flag.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5 is a 'F', but wait, no, row 4, column 5 is '.', not 'F'. Wait, row 5, column 5 is 'F', so that's a flag.\n\nWait, row 4, column 5 is '.', so no flag there. So, the 'F' at (5,5) is a bomb, so any numbers around it should account for that.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 6 is '.', which is adjacent to (5,5), which is a bomb. So, if I reveal (4,6), it might show a number indicating how many bombs are around it. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, column 5 is a '1', which is adjacent to (5,5), which is a bomb. So, the '1' at (7,5) is satisfied by the bomb at (5,5). So, no other bombs should be adjacent to (7,5). So, the squares around (7,5) should not have any other bombs.\n\nWait, but (7,5) is a '1', so exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (5,5) is a bomb, that's the one. So, the other squares around (7,5) should not have bombs. That might help in figuring out other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 4 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), and (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). Since (7,5) is a '1' and already has a bomb at (5,5), the '1' at (7,4) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. So, perhaps there's a bomb at (7,3) or (8,4), but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that's surrounded by numbers that can only be satisfied by placing a flag there.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 1 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). There are no flags nearby, so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Maybe I can flag one of these squares if it makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8, column 1 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). Again, no flags nearby, so exactly one bomb.\n\nI think I need to find a square where placing a flag would satisfy a '1' without causing conflicts elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking at row 3, column 3 is a '2'. It's adjacent to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). There's a flag at (2,3), so that's one bomb. So, the '2' at (3,3) needs another bomb. So, one more bomb must be adjacent to (3,3). The possible squares are (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Let's see if any of these can be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (3,2), which is '.', if I place a flag there, would that help? But I don't know yet. Alternatively, maybe (4,3) is a bomb, but (4,3) is adjacent to (4,2) which is '1', so that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (2,2) is a bomb, but (2,2) is adjacent to (1,1) which is '1', and (1,1) already has a flag at (2,0), so that's okay. So, placing a flag at (2,2) would satisfy the '2' at (3,3), but I'm not sure if that's the only option.\n\nWait, but I don't have any info about (2,2) yet. It's a '.' so it's unexplored. Maybe I should reveal it instead of flagging it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers that would be satisfied by a single flag.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 2 is a '2'. It's adjacent to (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). The '2' at (7,2) needs two bombs adjacent. So far, I don't see any flags nearby, so both bombs must be in the surrounding squares.\n\nSimilarly, the '2' at (7,3) is adjacent to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). So, that's another '2' needing two bombs.\n\nThis seems like a complex area. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0 is '_', which is empty. Maybe I can reveal that. But it's in the top-left corner, which is often a safe starting point, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9, column 9 is '.', which is the bottom-right corner. Maybe revealing that could help.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to make a move that either reveals a square or places a flag. Since I have flags remaining, maybe I can find a square that must be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nWait, looking at row 1, column 8 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). There's a flag at (0,9), so that's one bomb. The '1' at (1,8) is satisfied, so no other bombs should be adjacent. So, the other squares around (1,8) shouldn't have bombs. That might help in eliminating possibilities elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 1 is '.', which is adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). There's a flag at (2,0), which is one bomb. The '1' at (1,0) is satisfied. So, maybe (2,1) is safe, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's adjacent to a '1' and can only be a bomb. For example, if a '1' has only one possible square left for a bomb, I can flag it.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0 is a '1', which is adjacent to (2,0), which is a flag, so that's the one bomb. So, the other squares around (3,0) shouldn't have bombs.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 0 is '_', which is empty. Maybe revealing that could help.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a square that's adjacent to a '1' and can't have a bomb because it's already accounted for. For example, if a '1' is next to a square that's already been revealed as safe, then the bomb must be elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's surrounded by numbers that would make it impossible to place a flag there without conflicting.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to reveal a square that's likely to be safe. For example, row 9, column 0 is '_', which is empty. If I reveal that, maybe it's a number that can help.\n\nAlternatively, row 6, column 5 is '1', which is adjacent to (5,5), which is a flag. So, that '1' is satisfied, so no other bombs around there.\n\nWait, row 6, column 5 is '1', so exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (5,5) is a flag, that's the one. So, the other squares around (6,5) shouldn't have bombs. That might help in other areas.\n\nI think I need to make a move. Since I have flags remaining, perhaps I can place a flag where a number indicates it must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 3 is a '2', which needs another bomb. If I can find a square adjacent to it that must be a bomb, I can flag it.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, column 2 is a '2', needing two bombs. Maybe I can find a square there that must be a bomb.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers that can only be satisfied by placing a flag there.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 3 is a '2'. It's adjacent to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). So, two bombs must be in these squares.\n\nIf I can find a square that's adjacent to both a '2' and another number that would require it to be a bomb, that would be a good place to flag.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, column 5 is a '1', which is satisfied by (5,5). So, the other squares around it shouldn't have bombs.\n\nI think I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should just reveal a square that's likely to be safe. Let's pick row 9, column 0. It's in the corner, often a good starting point.\n\nBut wait, I have to make sure that revealing it won't hit a bomb. Since it's a corner, it only has three adjacent squares: (8,0), (8,1), and (9,1). If any of those have numbers, it might indicate a bomb nearby.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 1 is a '1', which is adjacent to (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). So, the '1' at (8,1) needs exactly one bomb. If I reveal (9,0) and it's a '1', that might indicate a bomb nearby.\n\nBut since I don't know, maybe it's better to place a flag somewhere else.\n\nWait, looking at row 5, column 5 is an 'F', so that's a bomb. The square at (5,5) is adjacent to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). So, any numbers around here must account for that bomb.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 6 is '.', which is adjacent to (5,5). If I reveal (4,6), it might show a number indicating how many bombs are around it. But I don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, column 5 is a '1', which is satisfied by (5,5). So, no other bombs around there.\n\nI think I'm going in circles. Maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a '1' and can only be a bomb. For example, if a '1' has only one possible square left for a bomb, I can flag it.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 8 is a '1', which is satisfied by (0,9). So, no other bombs around there.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 1 is a '2', which needs another bomb. The possible squares are (2,1), (3,2), (4,1). Wait, (4,1) is a '1', which is adjacent to (3,1). So, if (4,1) is a '1', it needs exactly one bomb. If I place a bomb at (3,2), that would satisfy both the '2' at (3,1) and potentially affect the '1' at (4,1).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to reveal (3,2). If it's a '1', that might help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag at (3,2) if it's the only possible bomb location for the '2' at (3,1). But I'm not certain.\n\nI think I've thought through this as much as I can. I'll decide to reveal a square that's likely to be safe. Let's go with row 9, column 0.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (9,0) to potentially uncover a number that could provide more information about the surrounding area.\nMOVE: 9,0,false", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 2, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the information given. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 6 flags remaining, which means I can place 6 more flags if needed. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each step of the analysis as outlined.\n\n1. **Check all revealed numbers against existing flags**: I need to make sure that the numbers on the board correctly reflect the number of bombs around them, considering the flags already placed. If a number shows a '1', there should be exactly one bomb in the adjacent squares, and if a flag is already placed nearby, that should account for that number.\n\nLooking at the board, I see several numbers and a couple of flags. Let's check each number to see if the flags around them make sense.\n\nStarting from the top-left, row 0 has a '1' at position (0,8) and a flag 'F' at (0,9). Wait, no, looking again, row 0 has a '1' at (0,8) and a 'F' at (0,9). So the '1' at (0,8) should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (0,8) are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). Since (0,9) is a flag, that accounts for the '1'. So that seems okay.\n\nNext, looking at row 1: (1,0) is '1', (1,1) is '1', (1,2) is '2', and (1,8) is '1', (1,9) is '.'. So for (1,0), which is a '1', the adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). There are no flags around it yet, so that's fine.\n\nMoving to row 2: (2,0) is 'F', (2,3) is 'F', (2,5) is '1', (2,7) is '1', (2,8) is '2'. Let's check (2,5) which is '1'. Its adjacent squares include (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). There are no flags nearby, so that's okay for now.\n\nRow 3: (3,0) is '1', (3,1) is '2', (3,3) is '2', (3,6) is '1', (3,8) is '1'. Let's check (3,1) which is '2'. The adjacent squares are (2,0) which is a flag, (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). So since (2,0) is a flag, that accounts for one bomb, so there should be exactly one more bomb around (3,1). I'll keep that in mind.\n\nRow 4: (4,1) is '1', (4,3) is '1', (4,6) is '1', (4,7) is '2'. Let's look at (4,1) which is '1'. Its adjacent squares include (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). There are no flags here, so that's okay.\n\nRow 5: (5,1) is '1', (5,2) is '1', (5,5) is 'F', (5,6) is '1', (5,7) is '2', (5,8) is '.'. Checking (5,5) which is 'F', adjacent to (5,4), (5,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Since it's a flag, it's accounted for.\n\nRow 6: (6,5) is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,5) is a flag, so that accounts for the '1' at (6,5).\n\nRow 7: (7,1) is '2', (7,2) is '2', (7,3) is '2', (7,4) is '1', (7,5) is '1'. Let's check (7,1) which is '2'. Adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). No flags here, so that's fine.\n\nRow 8: (8,1) is '1'. Adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). No flags, so okay.\n\nRow 9: (9,1) is '1'. Adjacent squares include (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). No flags.\n\nSo, after checking all the numbers against existing flags, I don't see any immediate conflicts. Each number seems to have the correct number of flags adjacent to it, or none if it's a lower number.\n\n2. **Look for obvious conflicts**: I don't see any obvious conflicts where a number is exceeded by the number of flags around it. For example, a '1' with two flags nearby would be a conflict, but I don't see that happening here.\n\n3. **Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs**: There are 10 bombs in total, and I've already placed 2 flags (at (0,9) and (2,0) and (2,3), wait let me count the flags. Looking back, the board shows 'F' at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), and (5,5). Wait, no, looking again: row 0 has 'F' at (0,9), row 2 has 'F' at (2,0) and (2,3), and row 5 has 'F' at (5,5). So that's 4 flags placed. Since there are 10 bombs, and I've placed 4 flags, I have 6 flags remaining. So I can place 6 more flags if needed.\n\nBut I have to be careful because placing a flag uses one of my remaining flags, and I don't want to place a flag where there's no bomb, as that would be a mistake.\n\n4. **Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile**: I need to look for areas where I can safely place a flag without conflicting with the numbers, or where I can reveal a tile to get more information.\n\nLooking at the board, let's see if there are any tiles that are definitely bombs based on the numbers around them.\n\nFor example, looking at row 3, column 1 is '2', which has a flag at (2,0). So the '2' at (3,1) should have exactly two bombs around it. One is already at (2,0), so there must be one more bomb in the adjacent tiles.\n\nThe adjacent tiles to (3,1) are (2,0) [F], (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). So, besides (2,0), we need one more bomb in these squares. Let's see if any of these squares are numbers that can help us.\n\nLooking at (4,1), which is '1'. So (4,1) has exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent tiles are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Since (3,1) is '2', and (3,0) is '1', perhaps (3,0) could be a bomb? Wait, (3,0) is '1', so it's a number, not a bomb. So (3,0) is safe, and it's indicating that there's one bomb around it. So the bomb near (3,0) must be in one of its adjacent tiles.\n\nWait, (3,0) is '1', so it has exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent tiles are (2,0) [F], (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). Since (2,0) is a flag, that accounts for the '1' at (3,0). So that's okay.\n\nGoing back to (3,1) which is '2', we know one bomb is at (2,0), so the other must be in the remaining adjacent tiles. Let's look at (4,1) which is '1'. So (4,1) has one bomb around it. The possible candidates are (3,0) [safe], (3,1) [safe], (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Since (3,0) is safe, the bomb must be elsewhere. Perhaps (4,0) or (5,0), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (3,2) is a bomb. Let me check (3,2). It's currently '.', so unexplored. If I could reveal (3,2), that might help. But I'm not sure if it's safe.\n\nLooking at other areas, let's check row 5, column 5 is 'F', which is a flag. Let's see if that's correct. The adjacent tiles to (5,5) are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (6,5) is '1', so that's accounted for by the flag at (5,5). So that seems correct.\n\nLooking at row 7, columns 1,2,3 are '2's. Let's see if we can find any bombs there. For example, (7,1) is '2', so it needs two bombs around it. Its adjacent tiles include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). None of these are flags yet, so perhaps there are two bombs in this area.\n\nBut I'm not sure where exactly. Maybe (8,1) is '1', which could help. (8,1) is '1', so it has one bomb around it. Its adjacent tiles are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). So one of these must be a bomb. But without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Maybe I can find a tile that is definitely a bomb based on the numbers around it. For example, if a tile is surrounded by numbers that require it to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 9 is 'F', so that's a flag. Let's see if that's correct. The adjacent tiles to (0,9) are (0,8), (1,8), (1,9). (0,8) is '1', which is accounted for by (0,9) as a flag. So that's correct.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 0 is 'F'. Its adjacent tiles include (1,0) which is '1', so that's accounted for. So that's correct.\n\nAnother approach: look for tiles that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which might indicate where a bomb is. For example, if two numbers both require a bomb to be in the same tile, that tile must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 3 is '2', and row 4, column 3 is '1'. Let me see their adjacent tiles. (3,3) is adjacent to (2,2), (2,3) [F], (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Since (2,3) is a flag, that accounts for one bomb, so (3,3) needs one more bomb in its adjacent tiles.\n\n(4,3) is '1', so it needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent tiles, which include (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). Since (3,3) is '2' and already has one flag at (2,3), it needs another bomb. So perhaps (5,3) is a bomb? Or maybe (3,4)?\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about another area.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 7 is '2'. Its adjacent tiles are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (5,6) is '1', which is accounted for by the flag at (5,5). So (5,6) is safe, so the '1' at (5,6) is correct. Therefore, the '2' at (5,7) must have two bombs around it. One could be at (5,5) [F], but that's already accounted for in (5,6). Wait, no, (5,5) is a flag, so it's a bomb. So (5,7) needs two bombs around it. One is at (5,5), so there must be another bomb adjacent to (5,7). Looking at the adjacent tiles, maybe (4,6) or (4,8) or (6,6) or (6,8). But I don't have enough info yet.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and is the only possible bomb location. For example, if a '1' is next to an unexplored tile and all other adjacent tiles are safe, then that tile must be the bomb.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is '1', and the only unexplored adjacent tile is (0,7). Because (0,9) is a flag, so (0,8)'s '1' is accounted for. Wait, no, (0,8) is '1', and its adjacent tiles are (0,7), (0,9) [F], (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). So (0,8)'s '1' is accounted for by (0,9). So (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) are all safe because (0,8) is '1' and already has a flag. So perhaps I can reveal (0,7), (1,7), etc., but I don't know if they're safe.\n\nWait, no, revealing a tile that's adjacent to a '1' that's already accounted for by a flag could be safe, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, column 5 is '1', and it's adjacent to (5,5) [F], so that's accounted for. So the '1' at (6,5) is correct.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 5 is '1', adjacent to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). Since (6,5) is '1', which is accounted for by (5,5) [F], so that's correct.\n\nHmm, I'm not finding any obvious places to flag. Maybe I should consider revealing a tile to get more information. Let's see where it's safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 7 is '.' and adjacent to (0,8) which is '1' with a flag at (0,9). So (0,7) is adjacent to (0,8) [1], which is accounted for, so (0,7) could be safe. Revealing (0,7) might show a number or a bomb. If it's a number, it could help. If it's a bomb, the game ends, which I don't want. So maybe that's too risky.\n\nLooking elsewhere, maybe row 1, column 0 is '1', which is adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0) [F], (2,1). Since (2,0) is a flag, that accounts for the '1' at (1,0). So the other adjacent tiles must be safe. Therefore, (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) are all safe. So revealing any of these could be safe, but I'm not sure if it's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9, column 1 is '1', adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). Since (9,1) is '1', and none of its adjacent tiles are flags, perhaps I can reveal one of them. But again, it's risky.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for a tile that is adjacent to multiple numbers, which would make it a likely bomb. For example, if a tile is adjacent to two '2's, it might be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 3 is '2', and row 4, column 3 is '1'. The tile at (3,3) is adjacent to (2,3) [F], so that's one bomb. It needs another bomb. The adjacent tiles are (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So perhaps (3,4) is a bomb because it's adjacent to (3,3) [2] and (4,3) [1]. Wait, (4,3) is '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (3,4) were a bomb, then (4,3) would have that as its one bomb, which is fine. But then (3,3) would have two bombs: (2,3) and (3,4), which would satisfy its '2'. That seems possible.\n\nSo maybe (3,4) is a bomb. If I could confirm that, I could place a flag there. But I can't be certain yet. Alternatively, I could try revealing (3,4) to see if it's a bomb, but that's risky.\n\nAnother approach: look for tiles that are adjacent to a '1' and are the only possible bomb location. For example, if a '1' has only one adjacent tile unexplored, that must be the bomb.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5 is 'F', and (5,6) is '1', which is accounted for by (5,5). So (5,6) is safe. Therefore, the adjacent tiles to (5,6) must be safe except for (5,5). So perhaps (5,7) is a bomb because (5,7) is '2' and needs two bombs. One is at (5,5), so another must be nearby.\n\nWait, (5,7) is '2', so it needs two bombs. One is at (5,5), so another must be in its adjacent tiles. Looking at (5,7)'s adjacent tiles: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (5,6) is '1', which is safe. So the other bomb must be in one of the other tiles. Maybe (6,7) is a bomb? But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, column 5 is '1', which is accounted for by (6,5) [1], but (6,5) is accounted for by (5,5) [F]. So that's okay.\n\nI'm going in circles here. Maybe I should try to find a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and is the only possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 6 is '1'. Its adjacent tiles are (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). (2,5) is '1', which is accounted for by (2,3) [F]. So (3,6)'s '1' must have one bomb in its adjacent tiles. The possible candidates are (2,5) [safe], (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). Since (2,5) is safe, the bomb must be elsewhere. Maybe (2,7) is a bomb? But (2,7) is '1', so it's a number, not a bomb. So the bomb must be in (2,6), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), or (4,7). \n\nWait, (3,5) is '.' so unexplored. If I could reveal (3,5), maybe I can find out. But that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, column 6 is '1'. Its adjacent tiles are (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5) [F], (5,6), (5,7). Since (5,5) is a flag, that accounts for the '1' at (4,6). So (4,6) is safe, and the other adjacent tiles must be safe except for (5,5). So (3,5), (3,6), etc., must be safe. Therefore, (3,5) is safe, so the bomb near (3,6) must be elsewhere.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and is the only possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 1 is '1'. Its adjacent tiles are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). Since (9,1) is '1', one of these must be a bomb. Let's see if any of these are adjacent to other numbers.\n\n(8,1) is '1', so it must have one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent tiles are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). So (8,1) is '1', and (9,1) is '1'. So if (9,1) is '1', it needs one bomb, and (8,1) is '1' needing one bomb. The only overlapping tile is (9,2), which is '.'. So perhaps (9,2) is a bomb. If I could confirm that, I could place a flag there.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe (8,0) or (8,2) is a bomb. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother idea: look for a tile that is adjacent to a '2' and is the only possible location for the second bomb. For example, if a '2' has one flag adjacent, the other bomb must be in a specific tile.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 1 is '2', with one flag at (2,0). So it needs another bomb in its adjacent tiles. The adjacent tiles are (2,0) [F], (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). So the other bomb must be in one of these. \n\n(3,0) is '1', which is accounted for by (2,0) [F], so (3,0) is safe. Therefore, the other bomb must be in (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), or (4,2).\n\nLooking at (4,1) which is '1', it needs one bomb. Its adjacent tiles include (3,0) [safe], (3,1) [2], (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Since (3,0) is safe, the bomb must be in one of the others. But I'm not sure where.\n\nWait, perhaps (3,2) is a bomb. If I could confirm that, it would satisfy both (3,1) [2] and (4,1) [1]. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (4,2) is a bomb. If (4,2) is a bomb, then (3,1) [2] would have two bombs: (2,0) and (4,2). That would satisfy it. Also, (4,1) [1] would have one bomb at (4,2), which would satisfy it. So that seems possible.\n\nSo perhaps (4,2) is a bomb. If I could place a flag there, that would satisfy both (3,1) and (4,1). But I'm not certain. Let me check if placing a flag at (4,2) would cause any conflicts with other numbers.\n\nLooking at the adjacent tiles to (4,2): (3,1) [2], (3,2), (4,1) [1], (4,3) [1], (5,1) [1], (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). \n\nIf (4,2) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (3,1) [2] would have two bombs: (2,0) and (4,2) \u2013 correct.\n- (4,1) [1] would have one bomb: (4,2) \u2013 correct.\n- (5,1) [1] would have one bomb: (4,2) \u2013 correct.\n- (4,3) [1] would have one bomb: (4,2) \u2013 correct.\n\nSo that seems to fit. Therefore, placing a flag at (4,2) would satisfy all these numbers without causing conflicts. \n\nBut wait, (4,3) is '1', and its adjacent tiles include (4,2) [potential bomb], (3,2), (3,3) [2], (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). If (4,2) is a bomb, then (4,3) is satisfied. So that seems okay.\n\nTherefore, I think placing a flag at (4,2) is a good move because it satisfies multiple numbers without causing any conflicts.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (4,2) satisfies the '2' at (3,1) by providing the second bomb and aligns with the '1's at (4,1), (5,1), and (4,3) without causing conflicts.\n\nMOVE: 4,2,true", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current board state and the game info. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 5 flags remaining, which means I can place 5 more flags if needed. But I have to be careful because placing a flag incorrectly could lead to losing the game if I accidentally flag a safe square or miss a bomb.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board and see which squares are already revealed and which are still unexplored. The board has some numbers and some flagged squares (marked with F). I need to make sure that any flags I place don't conflict with the numbers shown on the board. For example, if a square with a '1' has two flags around it, that's a conflict because '1' means there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nLet me go through the board step by step. Starting from the top-left corner (0,0), it's revealed as empty. Moving right, (0,1) is also empty, and (0,2) is empty. Then (0,3) is empty, (0,4) is empty, (0,5) is empty, (0,6) is empty, (0,7) is 1, and (0,8) is flagged (F), (0,9) is unexplored (.). So in row 0, there's a flag at (0,8), and the square at (0,7) shows 1, meaning there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nLooking at row 1: (1,0) is 1, (1,1) is 1, (1,2) is 2, (1,3) is 1, (1,4) is 1, (1,5) is unexplored, (1,6) is unexplored, (1,7) is 1, (1,8) is F, (1,9) is unexplored. So in row 1, there are two flags at (1,8) and (1,9) is unexplored. Wait, no, (1,8) is F, but (1,9) is ., so it's unexplored.\n\nRow 2: (2,0) is F, (2,1) is ., (2,2) is ., (2,3) is F, (2,4) is 1, (2,5) is unexplored, (2,6) is unexplored, (2,7) is 1, (2,8) is 2, (2,9) is unexplored.\n\nRow 3: (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 2, (3,2) is ., (3,3) is 2, (3,4) is 1, (3,5) is unexplored, (3,6) is unexplored, (3,7) is ., (3,8) is 1, (3,9) is unexplored.\n\nRow 4: (4,0) is ., (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is F, (4,3) is 1, (4,4) is ., (4,5) is unexplored, (4,6) is unexplored, (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is 2, (4,9) is unexplored.\n\nRow 5: (5,0) is ., (5,1) is 1, (5,2) is 1, (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is ., (5,5) is F, (5,6) is 1, (5,7) is 2, (5,8) is ., (5,9) is unexplored.\n\nRow 6: (6,0) is ., (6,1) is ., (6,2) is ., (6,3) is ., (6,4) is ., (6,5) is 1, (6,6) is ., (6,7) is ., (6,8) is ., (6,9) is unexplored.\n\nRow 7: (7,0) is ., (7,1) is 1, (7,2) is 2, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is 1, (7,5) is 1, (7,6) is ., (7,7) is ., (7,8) is ., (7,9) is unexplored.\n\nRow 8: (8,0) is ., (8,1) is 1, (8,2) is ., (8,3) is ., (8,4) is ., (8,5) is ., (8,6) is ., (8,7) is ., (8,8) is ., (8,9) is unexplored.\n\nRow 9: (9,0) is ., (9,1) is 1, (9,2) is ., (9,3) is ., (9,4) is ., (9,5) is ., (9,6) is ., (9,7) is ., (9,8) is ., (9,9) is unexplored.\n\nNow, I need to check each revealed number against the existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. Let's start with row 0, column 7, which is 1. The adjacent squares are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), and (1,8). Wait, (0,8) is flagged, so that's one bomb accounted for. Since (0,7) is 1, there can't be any more bombs adjacent to it. So the other adjacent squares must be safe. Therefore, (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), and (1,8) should be safe. But (1,8) is flagged, which is a problem because (0,7) is 1, and if (1,8) is a flag, that's the only bomb adjacent to (0,7). But wait, (1,8) is already flagged, so that's okay. So (0,7) is 1, and (1,8) is the bomb. So that's correct.\n\nNext, looking at row 1, column 0 is 1. The adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), and (2,1). (0,0) is empty, (0,1) is empty, (1,1) is 1, (2,0) is F, and (2,1) is empty. So the 1 at (1,0) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The only flag nearby is at (2,0). So that's correct. So (1,0) is 1, and the bomb is at (2,0), which is flagged. So no conflict there.\n\nRow 1, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Among these, (2,0) is flagged. So the 1 at (1,1) has one bomb adjacent, which is at (2,0). That's correct.\n\nRow 1, column 2 is 2. The adjacent squares are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Among these, (2,3) is flagged. So the 2 at (1,2) must have two bombs adjacent. Since one is at (2,3), there must be another bomb nearby. So there should be another bomb in the adjacent squares. Let's check the other squares: (0,3) is empty, (1,3) is 1, which might have a bomb adjacent, but let's see. Maybe the other bomb is at (1,3)? Wait, (1,3) is 1, so it can't be a bomb. Maybe (2,1) or (2,2) is a bomb? Or perhaps (0,2) is a bomb? But (0,2) is empty. Hmm, I'm not sure yet. Maybe I need to come back to this.\n\nRow 1, column 3 is 1. The adjacent squares are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Among these, (2,3) is flagged. So the 1 at (1,3) has one bomb adjacent, which is at (2,3). So that's correct.\n\nRow 1, column 7 is 1. The adjacent squares are (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). (0,8) is flagged, so that's one bomb. So the 1 at (1,7) is satisfied by (0,8). So that's correct.\n\nRow 1, column 8 is F. So that's a flag, and it's accounted for in the numbers around it.\n\nMoving to row 2, column 0 is F. So that's a flag. The square at (2,0) is flagged, which we've already considered.\n\nRow 2, column 3 is F. Another flag. So that's another bomb.\n\nRow 2, column 4 is 1. The adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Among these, (2,3) is flagged, so that's one bomb. So the 1 at (2,4) is satisfied by (2,3). So that's correct.\n\nRow 2, column 7 is 1. The adjacent squares are (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). (1,8) is flagged, so that's one bomb. So the 1 at (2,7) is satisfied by (1,8). So that's correct.\n\nRow 2, column 8 is 2. The adjacent squares are (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). Among these, (1,8) is flagged. So the 2 at (2,8) needs another bomb adjacent. So there must be another bomb in the adjacent squares. Let's check the other squares. (1,9) is unexplored, (2,9) is unexplored, (3,7) is ., (3,8) is 1, (3,9) is unexplored. So perhaps the other bomb is at (3,7) or (3,8) or (3,9). But (3,8) is 1, so it can't be a bomb. Maybe (3,7) is a bomb? Or (3,9)? Or perhaps (1,9) is a bomb? I'm not sure yet.\n\nRow 3, column 0 is 1. The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is flagged, so that's one bomb. So the 1 at (3,0) is satisfied by (2,0). Correct.\n\nRow 3, column 1 is 2. The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Among these, (2,0) is flagged. So the 2 at (3,1) needs another bomb adjacent. So there must be another bomb in the adjacent squares. Let's see: (2,1) is ., (2,2) is ., (3,2) is ., (4,0) is ., (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is F. So (4,2) is flagged, which is another bomb. So the two bombs adjacent to (3,1) are (2,0) and (4,2). So that's correct.\n\nRow 3, column 3 is 2. The adjacent squares are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Among these, (2,3) is flagged, (4,2) is flagged. So the 2 at (3,3) is satisfied by (2,3) and (4,2). Wait, that's two bombs, which matches the 2. So that's correct.\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 1. The adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Among these, (2,3) is flagged. So the 1 at (3,4) is satisfied by (2,3). Correct.\n\nRow 3, column 8 is 1. The adjacent squares are (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). Among these, (2,8) is 2, (4,8) is 2. Wait, (3,8) is 1, so it needs one bomb adjacent. Let's see: (2,7) is 1, (2,8) is 2, (2,9) is ., (3,7) is ., (3,9) is ., (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is 2, (4,9) is .. So where is the bomb? It must be adjacent to (3,8). So perhaps (4,7) is a bomb? Because (4,7) is 1, which would have one bomb adjacent. If (4,7) is a bomb, then (3,8) would have that as its adjacent bomb. Let me check (4,7): it's 1, so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. If (4,7) is a bomb, then (3,8) is satisfied. But wait, (4,7) is 1, meaning it's a number, not a bomb. So (4,7) is a square with 1, so it's safe. Therefore, the bomb adjacent to (3,8) must be elsewhere. Maybe (4,8) is 2, but that's a number, not a bomb. Hmm, perhaps (2,7) is 1, so it has a bomb adjacent. The bomb could be at (2,6), but (2,6) is unexplored. Or (1,7) is 1, which is satisfied by (0,8). Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should come back to this.\n\nRow 4, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Among these, (3,0) is 1, (4,2) is F. So the 1 at (4,1) has one bomb adjacent, which is (4,2). Correct.\n\nRow 4, column 3 is 1. The adjacent squares are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). Among these, (3,3) is 2, (4,2) is F. So the 1 at (4,3) is satisfied by (4,2). Correct.\n\nRow 4, column 7 is 1. The adjacent squares are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (3,8) is 1, (4,8) is 2, (5,8) is .. So the 1 at (4,7) must have one bomb adjacent. Maybe (5,7) is a bomb? Or (3,6) is a bomb? Or (5,6) is a bomb? Not sure yet.\n\nRow 4, column 8 is 2. The adjacent squares are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). Among these, (3,8) is 1, (4,7) is 1, (5,8) is .. So the 2 at (4,8) needs two bombs adjacent. Let's see: (3,7) is ., (3,9) is ., (4,9) is ., (5,7) is 2, (5,8) is ., (5,9) is .. Maybe the bombs are at (5,7) and (5,9)? Or (3,7) and (5,7)? Not sure.\n\nRow 5, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). Among these, (4,2) is F. So the 1 at (5,1) is satisfied by (4,2). Correct.\n\nRow 5, column 2 is 1. The adjacent squares are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). Among these, (4,2) is F. So the 1 at (5,2) is satisfied by (4,2). Correct.\n\nRow 5, column 3 is 1. The adjacent squares are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Among these, (4,2) is F. So the 1 at (5,3) is satisfied by (4,2). Correct.\n\nRow 5, column 5 is F. So that's a flag.\n\nRow 5, column 6 is 1. The adjacent squares are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). Among these, (5,5) is F. So the 1 at (5,6) is satisfied by (5,5). Correct.\n\nRow 5, column 7 is 2. The adjacent squares are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). Among these, (5,5) is F, but that's not adjacent. So the 2 at (5,7) needs two bombs adjacent. Let's see: (4,6) is ., (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is 2, (5,6) is 1, (5,8) is ., (6,6) is ., (6,7) is ., (6,8) is .. So maybe the bombs are at (4,6) and (4,8)? Or (6,6) and (6,7)? Not sure.\n\nRow 6, column 5 is 1. The adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). Among these, (5,5) is F. So the 1 at (6,5) is satisfied by (5,5). Correct.\n\nRow 7, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). Among these, none are flagged yet. So the 1 at (7,1) needs one bomb adjacent. Maybe (6,0) is a bomb? Or (7,0)? Or (8,1)? Not sure.\n\nRow 7, column 2 is 2. The adjacent squares are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). Among these, none are flagged yet. So the 2 at (7,2) needs two bombs adjacent. So there must be two bombs in these squares. Maybe (6,1) and (6,2)? Or (7,1) and (7,3)? Or (8,1) and (8,2)? Not sure.\n\nRow 7, column 3 is 2. The adjacent squares are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). Among these, none are flagged yet. So the 2 at (7,3) needs two bombs adjacent. Maybe (6,2) and (6,3)? Or (7,2) and (7,4)? Or (8,2) and (8,3)? Not sure.\n\nRow 7, column 4 is 1. The adjacent squares are (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). Among these, (6,5) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,5). So the 1 at (7,4) needs one bomb adjacent. Maybe (6,3) is a bomb? Or (7,3) is a bomb? Or (8,3) is a bomb? Not sure.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is 1. The adjacent squares are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). Among these, (6,5) is 1. So the 1 at (7,5) needs one bomb adjacent. Maybe (6,4) is a bomb? Or (7,4) is a bomb? Or (8,4) is a bomb? Not sure.\n\nRow 8, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). Among these, none are flagged yet. So the 1 at (8,1) needs one bomb adjacent. Maybe (7,0) is a bomb? Or (8,0)? Or (9,1)? Not sure.\n\nRow 9, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,0), (10,1), (10,2). Wait, the board is only 10x10, so (10,0) doesn't exist. So the adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). None are flagged yet. So the 1 at (9,1) needs one bomb adjacent. Maybe (8,0) is a bomb? Or (8,2)? Or (9,0)? Not sure.\n\nNow, considering the game info: there are 10 bombs in total. Let's count the flags placed so far. From the board:\n\n- (0,8) is F\n- (1,8) is F\n- (2,0) is F\n- (2,3) is F\n- (4,2) is F\n- (5,5) is F\n\nWait, that's 6 flags. But the game info says flags remaining: 5. So total flags placed so far should be 10 - 5 = 5. Wait, no, the game info says flags remaining: 5, which means the player has placed 10 - 5 = 5 flags. But looking at the board, I count 6 flags. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me recount the flags:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: (0,8) is F \u2192 1\nRow 1: (1,8) is F \u2192 2\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,3) \u2192 4\nRow 4: (4,2) \u21925\nRow5: (5,5) \u21926\n\nSo that's 6 flags. But the game info says flags remaining:5, which means total flags placed should be 5, because 10 bombs - 5 remaining flags = 5 placed. So there's an inconsistency here. Maybe the game info is incorrect, or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the game info says \"Flags remaining:5\", which probably means the player can place 5 more flags, so total flags placed so far are 10 -5=5. But on the board, I see 6 flags. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: (0,8) is F \u21921\nRow1: (1,8) is F \u21922\nRow2: (2,0), (2,3) \u21924\nRow4: (4,2) \u21925\nRow5: (5,5) \u21926\n\nSo 6 flags. But according to game info, only 5 should be placed. So perhaps the user made a mistake, or maybe one of the flags is incorrect. But as the player, I have to work with the current board. So perhaps the game info is accurate, and the board has 5 flags. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nRow0: (0,8) is F \u21921\nRow1: (1,8) is F \u21922\nRow2: (2,0) is F, (2,3) is F \u21924\nRow4: (4,2) is F \u21925\nRow5: (5,5) is F \u21926\n\nNo, it's definitely 6. So perhaps the game info is incorrect, or maybe the user intended it as 5 flags placed, so I have to consider that. Maybe I should proceed as if only 5 flags are placed, so I can't place any more. But I'm not sure. Let me assume that the game info is correct, and I have 5 flags remaining, meaning I can place 5 more. So I can place up to 5 flags.\n\nBut wait, the user says \"Flags remaining:5\", which usually means the number of flags left to place. So total bombs are 10, so if 5 flags are remaining, that means 5 have been placed already. So I have to check the board again to see if only 5 flags are placed.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow0: (0,8) is F \u21921\nRow1: (1,8) is F \u21922\nRow2: (2,0) is F \u21923\nRow2: (2,3) is F \u21924\nRow4: (4,2) is F \u21925\nRow5: (5,5) is F \u21926\n\nSo 6 flags. Therefore, perhaps the game info is wrong, or maybe I'm miscounting. Alternatively, maybe (5,5) isn't a flag. Let me check row5 again.\n\nRow5: (5,5) is F. Yes, it's F. So that's 6 flags. But game info says flags remaining:5, meaning 5 placed. So perhaps the user made a mistake. But as the player, I have to proceed. Maybe I should consider that I have 5 flags remaining, so I can place 5 more, but the board already has 6. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should proceed as if I have 5 flags remaining, and the board has 5 flags placed. So I can place 5 more. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game info is correct, and the board has 5 flags placed. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow0: (0,8) is F \u21921\nRow1: (1,8) is F \u21922\nRow2: (2,0) is F \u21923\nRow2: (2,3) is F \u21924\nRow4: (4,2) is F \u21925\nRow5: (5,5) is F \u21926\n\nSo 6 flags. Therefore, perhaps the game info is incorrect. Maybe the flags remaining are 4, not 5. Because 10 bombs - 6 flags placed = 4 remaining. So perhaps the user made a typo.\n\nBut regardless, I have to make a move. So perhaps I should focus on finding conflicts or possible flags.\n\nLooking back, I noticed that in row1, column2 is 2, which has one flag at (2,3), so it needs another bomb. Similarly, row2, column8 is 2, which has one flag at (1,8), so it needs another bomb.\n\nAlso, row5, column7 is 2, which has one flag at (5,5), so it needs another bomb.\n\nLooking at row5, column7: it's 2, and it's adjacent to (5,5) which is F. So it needs another bomb. The adjacent squares are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). So possible bombs could be at (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). Let's see which of these could be bombs without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (4,6): it's adjacent to (5,5) which is F, and (5,6) is 1. So (5,6) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,5). So (4,6) could be a bomb, but then (5,6) is 1, which is okay because (5,6) is adjacent to (5,5). So (4,6) being a bomb would affect (5,6) as well. Wait, (5,6) is 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent, which is (5,5). So if (4,6) is a bomb, then (5,6) would have two bombs adjacent: (5,5) and (4,6), which would make (5,6) a 2, but it's 1. So that's a conflict. Therefore, (4,6) can't be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (4,7) is 1. So it's a number, not a bomb.\n\n(4,8) is 2. So it's a number, not a bomb.\n\n(6,6) is ., (6,7) is ., (6,8) is .. So maybe (6,6) is a bomb? Let's see: if (6,6) is a bomb, then (5,6) is 1, which is adjacent to (5,5) and (6,6). That would make (5,6) have two bombs adjacent, but it's 1. So conflict. Therefore, (6,6) can't be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (6,7): if it's a bomb, then (5,7) is 2, which would have two bombs: (5,5) and (6,7). That's okay because (5,7) is 2. So that's possible.\n\n(6,8): if it's a bomb, then (5,8) is ., which is unexplored. So that could be a possibility.\n\nSo, for row5, column7 (which is 2), the possible bombs are (6,7) and (6,8). Let's see if placing a flag at (6,7) or (6,8) would conflict with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (6,7): it's adjacent to (5,6), which is 1, and (5,7), which is 2. If (6,7) is a bomb, then (5,7) is 2, which would have two bombs: (5,5) and (6,7). That's correct. Also, (6,7) is adjacent to (6,6), which is ., and (6,8), which is .. So no conflict there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,8) is adjacent to (5,7), which is 2, and (5,8), which is .. If (6,8) is a bomb, then (5,7) is 2, which would have two bombs: (5,5) and (6,8). That's correct. Also, (6,8) is adjacent to (6,7), which is ., and (7,7), which is .. So no conflict.\n\nSo both (6,7) and (6,8) could be bombs. But since the player can only place one flag at a time, perhaps I should choose one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find another square that can be revealed safely.\n\nLooking at row0, column7 is 1, and (0,8) is F. So (0,7) is 1, which is satisfied by (0,8). Therefore, the squares around (0,7) must be safe except for (0,8). So (0,6), (1,6), (1,7) must be safe. So perhaps I can reveal (0,6) safely.\n\nBut wait, (0,6) is adjacent to (0,7), which is 1, so it's safe. But (0,6) is also adjacent to (1,6), which is unexplored. If I reveal (0,6), it might show a number or be empty. But since (0,7) is 1, and (0,8) is F, (0,6) is safe.\n\nSo perhaps revealing (0,6) is a good move because it's safe and can give more information.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for other safe squares to reveal.\n\nLooking at row1, column0 is 1, and it's satisfied by (2,0). So the squares around (1,0) are safe except for (2,0). So (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) are safe. So perhaps I can reveal (1,1), which is 1, but it's already revealed. Alternatively, reveal (0,0) or (0,1), but they are already empty.\n\nLooking at row2, column4 is 1, satisfied by (2,3). So the squares around (2,4) are safe except for (2,3). So (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) are safe. So perhaps I can reveal (3,4), which is 1, but it's already revealed.\n\nLooking at row3, column1 is 2, satisfied by (2,0) and (4,2). So the squares around (3,1) are safe except for those two. So (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2) are safe. (4,2) is F, so safe. So perhaps I can reveal (3,2), which is ., but it's already revealed as empty.\n\nLooking at row4, column1 is 1, satisfied by (4,2). So the squares around (4,1) are safe except for (4,2). So (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2) are safe. So perhaps I can reveal (5,0), which is ., but it's already empty.\n\nLooking at row5, column6 is 1, satisfied by (5,5). So the squares around (5,6) are safe except for (5,5). So (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) are safe except for (5,5). So perhaps I can reveal (6,5), which is 1, but it's already revealed.\n\nAlternatively, I can reveal (6,6), which is ., but it's unexplored. If I reveal (6,6), it might show a number or be empty. Since (5,6) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,5), (6,6) is safe because it's adjacent to (5,6). Wait, no, (6,6) is adjacent to (5,6), which is 1, so (6,6) could be safe or have a bomb, but since (5,6) is 1, it can't have another bomb adjacent. Therefore, (6,6) must be safe. So revealing (6,6) is safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, I could look for other squares that are definitely safe.\n\nAnother approach is to look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which can help determine if they're safe or not.\n\nFor example, looking at (3,7): it's adjacent to (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). Among these, (2,7) is 1, (2,8) is 2, (3,8) is 1, (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is 2. So (3,7) is adjacent to several numbers. If (3,7) were a bomb, then (2,7) would have two bombs adjacent: (1,8) and (3,7), but (2,7) is 1, which is already satisfied by (1,8). So (3,7) can't be a bomb. Therefore, (3,7) is safe. So I can reveal (3,7) safely.\n\nWait, let me check that again. (2,7) is 1, which is satisfied by (1,8). So (2,7) can't have any other bombs adjacent. Therefore, (3,7) must be safe because if it were a bomb, (2,7) would have two bombs: (1,8) and (3,7), which would make (2,7) a 2, but it's 1. So (3,7) is safe. Therefore, revealing (3,7) is safe and would give me more information.\n\nSo perhaps I should reveal (3,7). Let me see what that would show. If I reveal (3,7), it could be empty or a number. If it's a number, it would indicate how many bombs are adjacent, which could help.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for other safe squares. For example, (5,8) is adjacent to (4,7), which is 1, and (5,7), which is 2. If (5,8) is a bomb, then (5,7) would have three bombs adjacent: (5,5), (5,7) is 2, but wait, (5,7) is 2, so it can't have three. Therefore, (5,8) can't be a bomb because that would make (5,7) have three bombs: (5,5), (6,7), and (5,8). So (5,8) must be safe. Therefore, I can reveal (5,8) safely.\n\nWait, let me think again. (5,7) is 2, which is satisfied by (5,5) and another bomb. If (5,8) is a bomb, then (5,7) would have two bombs: (5,5) and (5,8). So that's okay. But (5,8) is also adjacent to (4,7), which is 1. If (5,8) is a bomb, then (4,7) would have two bombs adjacent: (5,8) and another. But (4,7) is 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. Therefore, (5,8) can't be a bomb because that would make (4,7) have two bombs. Therefore, (5,8) must be safe. So I can reveal (5,8) safely.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is adjacent to (4,8), which is 2, and (5,8), which is safe. If (5,9) is a bomb, then (4,8) would have three bombs: (5,5), (5,9), and another. But (4,8) is 2, so it can only have two. Therefore, (5,9) can't be a bomb. So (5,9) is safe.\n\nWait, let me check that again. (4,8) is 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. If (5,9) is a bomb, then (4,8) would have bombs at (5,5) and (5,9), which is two. So that's okay. But (5,9) is also adjacent to (5,8), which is safe, and (6,8), which is .. So I'm not sure.\n\nBut considering that (4,7) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,5) or another bomb. If (5,8) is a bomb, then (4,7) would have two bombs: (5,5) and (5,8), which would make (4,7) a 2, but it's 1. Therefore, (5,8) can't be a bomb. So (5,8) is safe.\n\nTherefore, revealing (5,8) is safe and would help confirm whether it's a number or empty.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a square that must be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row1, column2 is 2, which has one flag at (2,3). So it needs another bomb. The possible squares are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2). Among these, (1,1) is 1, (1,3) is 1, so they can't be bombs. (0,1) and (0,2) are empty. So the remaining possibilities are (2,1) and (2,2). So either (2,1) or (2,2) must be a bomb.\n\nBut (2,1) is adjacent to (2,0), which is F. So (2,1) can't be a bomb because (2,0) is already a bomb, and (2,1) is empty. Therefore, (2,2) must be the bomb. So (2,2) is a bomb. Therefore, I can place a flag there.\n\nWait, but (2,2) is empty, so I can't place a flag there because it's already revealed as empty. Therefore, that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, (2,2) is empty, so it can't be a bomb. Therefore, the other possibility is (2,1) is a bomb, but (2,1) is empty. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, row1, column2 is 2, which has one flag at (2,3). So it needs another bomb. But the only possible squares are (2,1) and (2,2), which are both empty. Therefore, that's a conflict. So perhaps the flag at (2,3) is incorrect, or the number at (1,2) is wrong. But since the board is given, I have to work with it. So maybe I should remove the flag at (2,3) because it's causing a conflict.\n\nBut according to the rules, I can remove a flag by making a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So perhaps I should remove the flag at (2,3) because it's causing a conflict with (1,2)'s 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another square that can be safely revealed or flagged.\n\nLooking at row7, column5 is 1. The adjacent squares are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). Among these, (6,5) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,5). So (7,5) is 1, which needs one bomb adjacent. So possible bombs are (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). But (6,5) is 1, so (6,4) and (6,6) can't be bombs because that would make (6,5) have two bombs adjacent. Therefore, the bomb must be in (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), or (8,6).\n\nLooking at (7,4): it's 1, so it can't be a bomb. (7,6) is ., (8,4) is ., (8,5) is ., (8,6) is .. So the bomb must be in (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), or (8,6). But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, which can help determine if it's safe.\n\nLooking at (6,7): it's adjacent to (5,6), which is 1, and (5,7), which is 2. If (6,7) is a bomb, then (5,7) would have two bombs: (5,5) and (6,7), which is correct. Also, (5,6) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,5). So (6,7) being a bomb doesn't conflict with (5,6). Therefore, (6,7) could be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (6,8) is adjacent to (5,7), which is 2. If (6,8) is a bomb, then (5,7) would have two bombs: (5,5) and (6,8), which is correct. So both (6,7) and (6,8) could be bombs. But I can only place one flag at a time.\n\nAlternatively, I could reveal (6,7) or (6,8) to see if they're bombs or numbers.\n\nBut since I have flags remaining, perhaps I should place a flag at (6,7) or (6,8). But I'm not sure which one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another square that can be safely revealed.\n\nLooking at (3,7): as I thought earlier, it's safe because if it were a bomb, (2,7) would have two bombs, but (2,7) is 1. So (3,7) is safe. Therefore, revealing (3,7) is safe and would give me more info.\n\nSo perhaps I should reveal (3,7). Let me do that.\n\nBut wait, (3,7) is currently ., so if I reveal it, it might show a number or be empty. If it's a number, it would help. If it's empty, it would reveal surrounding squares.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for a square that is definitely a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row2, column8 is 2, which has one flag at (1,8). So it needs another bomb. The possible squares are (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). Among these, (2,7) is 1, (3,8) is 1, (1,7) is 1, so they can't be bombs. So the possible bombs are (1,9), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9). But (3,7) is safe, as established earlier. So the bombs must be at (1,9), (2,9), or (3,9).\n\nLooking at (1,9): it's adjacent to (0,8), which is F, and (1,8), which is F. So (1,9) is adjacent to two flags. But (1,9) is ., so it's unexplored. If (1,9) is a bomb, then (1,8) is F, which is correct. But (1,9) is also adjacent to (0,9), which is .. So I'm not sure.\n\n(2,9) is adjacent to (1,8), which is F, and (2,8), which is 2. So (2,9) could be a bomb.\n\n(3,9) is adjacent to (2,8), which is 2, and (3,8), which is 1. If (3,9) is a bomb, then (3,8) would have two bombs: (2,8) and (3,9), but (3,8) is 1. So that's a conflict. Therefore, (3,9) can't be a bomb. Therefore, the possible bombs are (1,9) and (2,9).\n\nBut I can't determine which one yet. So perhaps I should proceed with revealing (3,7), as it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for other safe squares.\n\nLooking at (5,8): as I thought earlier, it's safe because (4,7) is 1, which would have two bombs if (5,8) is a bomb. So (5,8) is safe. Therefore, revealing (5,8) is safe.\n\nSo, I think revealing (5,8) is a good move because it's safe and will give me more information.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, which can help determine if it's a bomb or not.\n\nAnother approach is to look for squares that are adjacent to all their possible bombs, meaning they must be safe.\n\nFor example, (3,7) is safe because if it were a bomb, (2,7) would have two bombs, which is impossible. So revealing (3,7) is safe.\n\nTherefore, I think the best move is to reveal (3,7) because it's safe and will provide more information.\n\nBut wait, (3,7) is adjacent to (2,7), which is 1. So (3,7) is safe, as established.\n\nSo, the move would be to reveal (3,7), which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could reveal (5,8), which is also safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure which one would give more information. Revealing (3,7) might show a number that could help with other parts of the board.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with revealing (3,7).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The square at (3,7) is safe to reveal because it cannot be a bomb without causing a conflict with the number at (2,7), which is 1. Revealing this square will provide additional information about the board without risking a game over.\n\nMOVE: 3,7,false", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has 5 flags remaining, which means they can place 5 more flags if needed. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without hitting any.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice that some squares are already revealed with numbers, some are flagged (F), some are still unexplored (. ), and some are empty (_). My task is to determine the next move, which can be either revealing a tile or placing a flag.\n\nI'll start by examining the revealed numbers to see if they give any clues about where the bombs might be. Let's go row by row.\n\nStarting with row 0: The 8th column (y=8) is a 1, and the 9th column (y=9) is an F. So, at (0,8), it's a 1, meaning there's exactly one bomb in the adjacent 8 squares around it. The adjacent squares to (0,8) would be (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). But (0,9) is an F, so that's a flagged bomb. Therefore, the 1 at (0,8) is satisfied by the flag at (0,9), so no other bombs should be adjacent to (0,8). That means the surrounding squares around (0,8) except (0,9) should be safe. But wait, let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, the number at (0,8) is 1, and it's adjacent to a flag at (0,9). So that should satisfy the count, meaning no other bombs around (0,8). So the squares around (0,8) except (0,9) should be safe. But I need to see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at row 0, the squares around (0,8) are (0,7), (0,9) which is F, (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). So, (0,7) is _, which is empty, and (1,7) is _, (1,8) is 1, and (1,9) is . So, the 1 at (0,8) is already accounted for by the F at (0,9), so (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) should be safe. But (1,8) is a 1, which is a number, so it's already revealed. So, that makes sense.\n\nNext, looking at row 1: The first three columns (y=0,1,2) are all 1s. Then y=3 is 2, y=4 is 1, and so on. Let me check the squares around these numbers.\n\nAt (1,0): it's a 1, so exactly one bomb is adjacent. The adjacent squares would be (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). But I don't know the state of these squares yet. (0,0) is _, (0,1) is _, (1,1) is 1, (2,0) is F, and (2,1) is _. So, the 1 at (1,0) could be satisfied by the F at (2,0). So that would mean no other bombs around (1,0). Therefore, the other adjacent squares should be safe. But let's check if that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is a 1, so it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). From this, (2,0) is F, so that would satisfy the count for (1,1). So, the other squares around (1,1) should be safe.\n\nMoving on to (1,2) which is a 2. So, it needs exactly two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). From this, I know (2,3) is F, so that's one bomb. So, there must be another bomb adjacent to (1,2). So, perhaps one of the other squares is a bomb. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 2: (2,0) is F, (2,3) is F, and (2,4) is 1. So, the 1 at (2,4) needs exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares would be (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Since (2,3) is F, that satisfies the count, so no other bombs around (2,4).\n\nIn row 3: (3,1) is 2, (3,3) is 2, (3,4) is 1. Let me check (3,1): it's a 2, so two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares include (2,0) which is F, so that's one. So, another bomb must be adjacent. Maybe (2,1) or (3,0) or (4,0), but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at row 4: (4,2) is F, and (4,3) is 1. So, the 1 at (4,3) needs one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). Since (4,2) is F, that satisfies the count, so no other bombs around (4,3).\n\nRow 5: (5,5) is F, (5,6) is 1, (5,7) is 2. The 1 at (5,6) needs one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares include (5,5) which is F, so that's the one. So, no other bombs around (5,6).\n\nRow 6: (6,5) is 1. So, it needs one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). Since (5,5) is F, that's the one, so no other bombs around (6,5).\n\nRow 7: (7,1) is 2, (7,2) is 2, (7,3) is 1, (7,4) is 1. Let's see, (7,1) is 2, so two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). Not sure yet.\n\nRow 8: (8,1) is 1. So, it needs one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). Not sure yet.\n\nRow 9: (9,1) is 1. So, same as above, but maybe it's connected to row 8's 1.\n\nNow, considering the flags remaining: 5 flags left, and total bombs are 10. So, the player can place 5 more flags. But I need to be careful because placing a flag incorrectly can lead to a conflict with the numbers.\n\nI should check for any obvious conflicts. Let's look for any numbers that might already have too many flags around them.\n\nFor example, looking at (0,8) which is 1, and it's adjacent to (0,9) which is F. So that's fine, as the count is satisfied.\n\nLooking at (1,0) which is 1, adjacent to (2,0) which is F. So that's satisfied.\n\n(1,1) is 1, adjacent to (2,0) F, so that's satisfied.\n\n(1,2) is 2, adjacent to (2,3) F, so needs one more bomb adjacent.\n\n(2,4) is 1, adjacent to (2,3) F, so that's satisfied.\n\n(3,1) is 2, adjacent to (2,0) F, needs one more bomb.\n\n(4,3) is 1, adjacent to (4,2) F, so satisfied.\n\n(5,6) is 1, adjacent to (5,5) F, so satisfied.\n\n(6,5) is 1, adjacent to (5,5) F, so satisfied.\n\n(7,1) is 2, needs two bombs adjacent.\n\n(8,1) is 1, needs one bomb adjacent.\n\n(9,1) is 1, needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nNow, let me see if any of these numbers have conflicting flags.\n\nFor example, (1,2) is 2, already has one F at (2,3). So, it needs another F adjacent. So, perhaps one of the surrounding squares is a bomb. Let me check the possible squares around (1,2): (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (2,3) is F, so one bomb. So, another bomb must be in one of the remaining squares. Let's see if any of those are already revealed or have numbers that might conflict.\n\nLooking at (0,2): it's _, so empty. (0,3): it's _, empty. (1,3): it's 2. So, (1,3) is a 2, meaning it needs two bombs adjacent. Wait, (1,3) is 2, so it's adjacent to (1,2) which is 2, and (2,3) which is F. So, that would satisfy one bomb. So, (1,3) needs another bomb adjacent. So, perhaps (0,3) is a bomb? But (0,3) is currently empty. Or maybe (1,4) is a bomb? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (2,2) is a bomb. If (2,2) is a bomb, then (1,2)'s count would be satisfied, and (1,3)'s count would also be satisfied because it would have two bombs: (2,3) and (2,2). That could work.\n\nBut I don't have enough information yet. Maybe I should look for other clues.\n\nLooking at row 7: (7,1) is 2, so two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). So, I need to find two bombs in these squares. But I don't have any flags here yet, so maybe I can find a way to deduce.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8: (8,1) is 1, so one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares include (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). So, one bomb in these. Similarly, (9,1) is 1, so same area.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a number which can only be satisfied by a specific square.\n\nFor example, looking at (5,6) which is 1, adjacent to (5,5) F. So, that's satisfied. So, the other squares around (5,6) should be safe. So, perhaps I can reveal (5,7) or (5,4) or (4,6) or (6,6), but I don't know if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (6,5) which is 1, adjacent to (5,5) F. So, same as above.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a square that is surrounded by numbers that can help me deduce where a bomb is.\n\nLooking at (2,4) which is 1, adjacent to (2,3) F. So, that's satisfied. So, the other squares around (2,4) should be safe. So, maybe I can reveal (2,5) or (3,4) or (3,5), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (3,3) which is 2, adjacent to (2,3) F. So, needs another bomb. So, perhaps (3,2) or (3,4) or (4,3) or (4,2) which is F, but that's already counted. Wait, (4,2) is F, so that's another bomb. So, (3,3) is adjacent to (4,2) F, which would satisfy the count of 2. So, that would mean (3,3) is satisfied by (2,3) and (4,2). So, no other bombs around (3,3). Therefore, the surrounding squares of (3,3) should be safe except for those two. So, perhaps I can reveal some of those.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, which can help me deduce.\n\nLooking at (1,3) which is 2. It's adjacent to (1,2) which is 2, (1,4) which is 1, (2,3) which is F, and others. Since (1,3) is 2, and already has (2,3) as a bomb, it needs one more. So, perhaps (0,3) or (1,4) or (2,2) is a bomb.\n\nWait, (1,4) is 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. So, if (1,4) is 1, and it's adjacent to (1,3) which is 2, then the bomb must be somewhere else. So, maybe (1,5) is a bomb? Or (2,4), but (2,4) is 1, which is satisfied by (2,3). So, perhaps (1,5) is a bomb.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is surrounded by all numbers, which would indicate it's a bomb. But I don't see any such squares yet.\n\nAnother approach is to look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which could help narrow down the possibilities.\n\nLooking at (2,2), which is adjacent to (1,1) which is 1, (1,2) which is 2, (2,1) which is _, and (2,3) which is F, and others. If (2,2) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s count would be satisfied by (2,0) F, which it already is. (1,2)'s count would be satisfied by (2,3) F and (2,2) F, making it 2, which fits. So, that could be a possibility.\n\nSo, if I place a flag at (2,2), that would satisfy both (1,1) and (1,2)'s counts. But I need to check if that causes any conflicts elsewhere.\n\nWait, (2,2) is adjacent to (3,2) which is _, and (3,3) which is 2. If (2,2) is a bomb, then (3,3)'s count would be satisfied by (2,3) and (2,2), making it 2, which fits. So, that seems okay.\n\nBut I'm not sure if (2,2) is actually a bomb. Maybe I should check other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (0,7) is a bomb. Let me see: (0,7) is adjacent to (0,8) which is 1, and (1,7) which is _, and (1,8) which is 1. If (0,7) is a bomb, then (0,8)'s count would be 1, which is satisfied by (0,9) F. But (1,7) is _, which is empty, and (1,8) is 1, which would then have to have another bomb adjacent. So, if (0,7) is a bomb, (1,8) would have two bombs: (0,9) F and (0,7) bomb. But (1,8) is 1, which can't have two bombs. So, that would be a conflict. Therefore, (0,7) cannot be a bomb.\n\nSo, that means (0,7) must be safe. Therefore, the bomb that (0,8) is counting must be (0,9) F, which is correct. So, (0,7) is safe, and (1,7) is also safe because (0,8)'s count is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (1,7): it's _, so empty. It's adjacent to (0,7) which is safe, (0,8) which is 1, (1,6) which is _, (1,8) which is 1, and (2,7) which is _, etc. Since (1,8) is 1, and it's adjacent to (0,8) which is 1, which is satisfied by (0,9) F, so (1,8) needs one bomb adjacent. The possible bombs could be (1,7), but we just saw that (0,7) is safe, so (1,7) is also safe. Therefore, (1,8) must have its bomb elsewhere. So, perhaps (2,8) is a bomb? Let me check.\n\nLooking at (2,8): it's 1. So, it's a number, not a bomb. So, that can't be. Therefore, (1,8) must have its bomb somewhere else. Wait, (1,8) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). From these, (0,9) is F, so that's the one. So, (1,8) is satisfied by (0,9) F. Therefore, the other squares around (1,8) should be safe. So, (1,7) is safe, (1,9) is ., (2,7) is _, (2,8) is 1, (2,9) is . So, that seems okay.\n\nNow, going back to (1,2) which is 2, needing another bomb. Since (2,2) is a possible candidate, let me consider placing a flag there. But before I do that, I should check if that would cause any conflicts with other numbers.\n\nIf I place a flag at (2,2), then:\n\n- (1,1) is 1, which is already satisfied by (2,0) F.\n- (1,2) is 2, which would be satisfied by (2,3) F and (2,2) F.\n- (2,1) is _, which is empty, but (2,1) is adjacent to (1,1) which is 1, so it's safe.\n- (3,2) is adjacent to (2,2) F and (3,3) which is 2. So, (3,3) would have two bombs: (2,3) F and (2,2) F, which fits its count.\n\nSo, placing a flag at (2,2) seems to satisfy all adjacent numbers without causing conflicts. Also, since the player has 5 flags remaining, placing a flag here would be within the limit.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider revealing a square, but placing a flag might be more strategic if it helps satisfy multiple counts.\n\nSo, the move would be to place a flag at (2,2), which is x=2, y=2, flag=true.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if (2,2) is indeed a bomb. Because if I place a flag there and it's not a bomb, that would be a mistake. But based on the numbers, it seems plausible.\n\nAnother way to confirm is to see if any other squares around (1,2) could be bombs. For example, (0,2) is _, but (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1) which is _, and (0,3) which is _, and (1,2) which is 2. If (0,2) were a bomb, then (0,1) would have to have another bomb, but (0,1) is adjacent to (1,1) which is 1, which is already satisfied by (2,0) F. So, (0,2) can't be a bomb because that would require (0,1) to have two bombs, which it can't.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is 2, which is adjacent to (2,3) F, so it needs another bomb. If (1,3) is 2, then perhaps (0,3) is a bomb. Let me check: (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2) which is _, (0,4) which is _, (1,3) which is 2, and (1,2) which is 2. If (0,3) is a bomb, then (0,2) would have to have another bomb, which is not possible because (0,1) is 1 and already satisfied. So, (0,3) can't be a bomb. Therefore, the other bomb for (1,3) must be (2,2) or (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is 1, so it can't have another bomb. Therefore, (2,2) must be the bomb for both (1,2) and (1,3). So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, placing a flag at (2,2) is the correct move.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (2,2) satisfies the counts for both (1,2) and (1,3) without conflicting with other revealed numbers. This move is consistent with the critical flag placement rules and helps in correctly identifying a bomb location.\n\nMOVE: 2,2,true", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 2, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the information provided. \n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has already placed some flags, and there are 4 flags remaining. My goal is to either reveal a tile or place a flag, but I have to be careful not to reveal a bomb, which would end the game.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some tiles have been revealed, showing numbers which indicate the number of adjacent bombs. There are also some flags (marked as F) on the board. I need to make sure that any flags I place don't conflict with the numbers shown on the revealed tiles.\n\nLet me go through the board row by row to see where I can find clues.\n\nStarting with row 0: It has some revealed tiles, but most are still unexplored. The last tile in row 0 is a flag, so I should check if that's correctly placed. But without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nIn row 1, the first three tiles are all 1s, which means each has exactly one adjacent bomb. There's a flag in position (1,8), so I should check if that's valid. The tile at (1,8) is an F, so if the surrounding numbers allow for that, it's okay. But I need to see if the numbers around it support that.\n\nRow 2 has a few flags and some numbers. The tile at (2,0) is an F, and the tile at (2,2) is also an F. Then there's a 1 at (2,4), a 2 at (2,8), and so on. I need to see if these flags are correctly placed according to the numbers.\n\nRow 3 has a 1 at (3,0), a 2 at (3,1), and some other numbers. The flags in row 3 are at (3,2), but it's actually an F, so I need to check if that's consistent.\n\nRow 4 has an F at (4,2), and some numbers around it. I should check if the numbers around that flag are okay with it being there.\n\nRow 5 has a flag at (5,5), so I need to see if that's valid based on the surrounding numbers.\n\nNow, let me think about the critical flag placement rules. Each number must have exactly the number of adjacent bombs as indicated. So, if a tile shows 1, there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to it, no more, no less. If I place a flag somewhere, I have to make sure that it doesn't cause any of the revealed numbers to have more or fewer bombs than they should.\n\nLet me look for tiles where the numbers might indicate that a flag is incorrectly placed. For example, if a tile with a 1 has two flags adjacent, that's a conflict because it can only have one bomb. Or if a tile with a 2 has only one flag, but no other bombs around, that might be a problem.\n\nLooking at row 1, columns 0,1,2 are all 1s. Each of these should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Let me check around these tiles. The tile at (1,0) is a 1, so it must have exactly one bomb in the surrounding 8 tiles. The surrounding tiles include (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). Among these, (1,1) is a 1, which is a revealed tile, not a bomb. So the bomb adjacent to (1,0) must be in one of the other tiles. Since (0,0) is revealed as _, it's not a bomb, so the bomb must be in (2,0) or (2,1). But (2,0) is an F, so that's a flag. So that's one bomb accounted for. Therefore, the tile at (1,0) is satisfied because it has exactly one bomb adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, the tile at (1,1) is a 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. The surrounding tiles include (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Among these, (2,0) is an F, so that's one bomb. So that's okay.\n\nThe tile at (1,2) is a 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. Let's check around it. The surrounding tiles include (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Among these, (2,2) is an F, so that's one bomb. Are there any others? Let's see: (0,3) is a _, so not a bomb. (2,3) is a F, so that's another bomb. So that's two bombs, which matches the 2. So that's okay.\n\nNow, looking at row 2, tile (2,4) is a 1, so it needs one bomb adjacent. The surrounding tiles include (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Among these, (2,3) is an F, so that's one bomb. So that's okay.\n\nTile (2,8) is a 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. The surrounding tiles include (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). Among these, (1,8) is an F, so that's one bomb. Any others? Let's see: (3,9) is a ., so unexplored. (2,7) is a ., so maybe. (1,7) is a ., (1,9) is a ., (3,7) is a ., (3,8) is a ., (2,9) is a .. So only one bomb so far. So maybe there's another bomb somewhere else adjacent. But I don't see any other flags around, so maybe that's okay for now.\n\nMoving to row 3, tile (3,0) is a 1. Surrounding tiles include (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is an F, so that's one bomb, which satisfies the 1.\n\nTile (3,1) is a 2. Surrounding tiles include (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Among these, (2,0) is an F, so that's one bomb. (3,2) is an F, so that's another bomb. So that's two bombs, which matches the 2. So that's okay.\n\nTile (3,3) is a 2. Surrounding tiles include (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Among these, (2,2) is an F, (3,2) is an F, and (2,3) is an F. So that's three bombs adjacent, but the tile is a 2. That's a problem because it shows 2, but there are three flags around it. That's a conflict. So either one of those flags is incorrectly placed, or the tile is wrong. But since the tile is a 2, it can't have three bombs adjacent. So one of the flags around it must be incorrect.\n\nLooking at the flags around (3,3): (2,2), (3,2), and (2,3) are all F. So that's three flags, but the tile at (3,3) is a 2, which can't have three bombs. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrectly placed. \n\nSo I need to figure out which flag is incorrect. Let me check the surrounding tiles of each flag to see if they can support having a bomb there.\n\nStarting with (2,2): It's an F. Let's check the surrounding tiles of (2,2). The surrounding tiles include (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Among these, (1,1) is a 1, (1,2) is a 2, (3,1) is a 2, (3,3) is a 2, (2,1) is a 1, (2,3) is an F, (3,2) is an F. \n\nWait, the tile at (2,2) is an F, so it's considered a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. For example, the tile at (1,2) is a 2, which should have two bombs adjacent. It's surrounded by (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Among these, (2,2) is an F, (2,3) is an F. So that's two bombs, which matches the 2. So that's okay.\n\nThe tile at (1,1) is a 1, and it's surrounded by (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Among these, (2,2) is an F, so that's one bomb, which matches the 1. So that's okay.\n\nThe tile at (3,1) is a 2, and it's surrounded by (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Among these, (2,2) is an F, (3,2) is an F, so that's two bombs, which matches the 2.\n\nThe tile at (3,3) is a 2, but as we saw, it has three Fs around it, which is a problem. So perhaps one of those Fs is incorrect. Let's check the other flags around (3,3): (3,2) and (2,3). \n\nLooking at (3,2): It's an F. Let's check the surrounding tiles. The surrounding tiles include (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Among these, (2,2) is an F, (2,3) is an F, and (3,3) is a 2. So the tile at (3,2) is an F, but let's see if the numbers around it allow for that.\n\nThe tile at (3,1) is a 2, which we already checked. The tile at (4,2) is an F. Wait, no, (4,2) is an F, but that's a different flag. Wait, no, (4,2) is an F, but that's in row 4, column 2. Let me check the numbers around (3,2). The tile at (3,3) is a 2, which is adjacent to (3,2). So if (3,2) is a bomb, then (3,3) has at least one bomb adjacent, which is fine because it's a 2. But (3,3) already has three bombs, which is a problem. So perhaps (3,2) shouldn't be a flag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (2,3) is incorrectly flagged. Let's check the surrounding tiles of (2,3). The tile at (2,3) is an F, so it's considered a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. The tile at (1,2) is a 2, which we already saw has two bombs, so that's okay. The tile at (1,3) is a _, but it's in row 1, column 3. Let me see what's around (1,3). The surrounding tiles include (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Among these, (2,3) is an F, (2,2) is an F, so that's two bombs. But (1,3) is a _, so it's not a number, so we don't know. However, the tile at (2,4) is a 1, which is adjacent to (2,3). So (2,4) is a 1, and it's surrounded by (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Among these, (2,3) is an F, so that's one bomb, which satisfies the 1. So that's okay.\n\nSo, going back to the problem at (3,3), which is a 2 but has three flags around it. One of these flags must be wrong. Let's see which one is causing the issue.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (3,2), then (3,3) would have two flags: (2,2) and (2,3), which is okay because it's a 2. Alternatively, if I remove (2,3), then (3,3) would have (2,2) and (3,2) as flags, which is still two, which is okay. Or if I remove (2,2), then (3,3) would have (3,2) and (2,3) as flags, which is two, also okay.\n\nBut which one is the correct one to remove? Let's look at other parts of the board for clues.\n\nLooking at row 4, tile (4,2) is an F. Let's check the surrounding tiles. The surrounding tiles include (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). Among these, (3,2) is an F, (3,3) is a 2. So if (4,2) is a flag, then the tile at (5,2) is a 1, which is in row 5, column 2. Let me check that tile.\n\nTile (5,2) is a 1. It's surrounded by (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). Among these, (4,2) is an F, so that's one bomb. So the tile at (5,2) is satisfied. So that's okay.\n\nBut the problem is that (3,3) has three flags around it. So I need to decide which flag is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag at (3,2) is incorrect. Let's see if removing that flag would solve the problem. If I remove the flag at (3,2), then (3,3) would have two flags: (2,2) and (2,3), which is correct for a 2. Also, let's check the surrounding tiles of (3,2). If (3,2) is not a bomb, then the numbers around it should not have more bombs than indicated.\n\nIf (3,2) is not a bomb, then the tile at (3,1) is a 2, which is adjacent to (3,2). So if (3,2) is not a bomb, then (3,1) must have two bombs elsewhere. The surrounding tiles of (3,1) include (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Among these, (2,2) is an F, (4,2) is an F. So that's two bombs, which matches the 2. So even if (3,2) is not a bomb, (3,1) is still okay because it has two bombs from (2,2) and (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, the tile at (4,2) is an F, which is a bomb. The tile at (4,1) is a 1, which is adjacent to (4,2). So (4,1) is a 1, which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. It's surrounded by (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Among these, (4,2) is an F, so that's one bomb, which satisfies the 1. So that's okay.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (3,2), then (3,3) is okay, and all surrounding tiles are okay. So perhaps (3,2) is incorrectly flagged. Therefore, my next move could be to remove the flag at (3,2).\n\nAlternatively, I could look for other areas where flags might be conflicting. Let's check row 5, tile (5,5) is an F. Let's see the surrounding tiles. The tile at (5,5) is an F, so it's considered a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it.\n\nThe surrounding tiles include (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Among these, (4,4) is a ., (4,5) is a ., (5,4) is a ., (6,4) is a ., etc. So no numbers around it, so it's hard to tell if it's conflicting. But perhaps it's correctly placed.\n\nAnother area to look is row 7 and row 8, which have some numbers. For example, row 7 has a 1 at (7,1), a 2 at (7,2), etc. Let me check if any flags in these areas are conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps the most pressing issue is the conflict at (3,3), so I should address that first.\n\nSo, to resolve the conflict at (3,3), I need to remove one of the flags around it. The flags are at (2,2), (3,2), and (2,3). Let me see which one is the most likely to be incorrect.\n\nLooking at (2,2): It's surrounded by (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Among these, (1,2) is a 2, which is satisfied by (2,2) and (2,3). So if I remove (2,2), then (1,2) would only have one bomb, which would be incorrect because it's a 2. So (2,2) must stay as a flag because (1,2) is a 2 and already has two bombs.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (2,3): It's surrounded by (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). Among these, (1,2) is a 2, which is satisfied by (2,2) and (2,3). So if I remove (2,3), then (1,2) would only have one bomb, which is (2,2), making it incorrect because it's a 2. So (2,3) must stay as a flag.\n\nThat leaves (3,2) as the flag that can be removed without causing conflicts elsewhere. So removing the flag at (3,2) would resolve the conflict at (3,3), because then (3,3) would only have two flags: (2,2) and (2,3), which matches its value of 2.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to remove the flag at (3,2). So I would make a move with flag=true on (3,2) to remove it.\n\nWait, no. According to the rules, to remove a flag, you make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So the move would be x=3, y=2, flag=true.\n\nBut wait, in the board, (3,2) is an F, so I can remove it by setting flag=true again. So the move would be to place a flag again, but that would remove it. So the move is (3,2), flag=true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal a tile instead. But in this case, since there's a conflict, it's better to fix the flag.\n\nSo, the explanation is that the tile at (3,3) is a 2, but it has three flags around it, which is a conflict. By removing the flag at (3,2), the conflict is resolved.\n\nSo, the move would be to remove the flag at (3,2), which is (3,2), flag=true.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The tile at (3,3) is a 2 but has three adjacent flags, causing a conflict. Removing the flag at (3,2) resolves this conflict without affecting other tiles.\n\nMOVE: 3,2,true", "flags_remaining": 4, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 7, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the information provided.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 3 flags remaining, which means I can place up to 3 more flags. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs without hitting any. If I reveal a bomb, the game ends, so I need to be careful.\n\nLooking at the board, I see several revealed numbers and some flagged squares (marked as F). My first step is to check all the revealed numbers against the existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. If a numbered tile shows, for example, '1', it should have exactly one adjacent bomb. If it already has a flag next to it, there can't be another bomb adjacent to it. Similarly, a '2' must have exactly two bombs around it, so if one is already flagged, there must be another somewhere else nearby.\n\nI'll go row by row to spot any obvious conflicts or possible moves.\n\nStarting with row 0: The revealed squares are at (0,8) which is 1 and (0,9) which is F. The 1 at (0,8) means there's exactly one bomb in the surrounding 8 squares. The adjacent squares to (0,8) would be (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). But (0,9) is already flagged, so that's one bomb accounted for. Therefore, the other adjacent squares shouldn't have any more bombs because the count is 1. So, (0,7) must be safe, but it's currently unexplored. Wait, no, (0,7) is a 1 in the initial state? Let me check again. Wait, the initial board state shows row 0 as \"_ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\". So (0,8) is 1, and (0,9) is F. So the 1 at (0,8) has exactly one bomb adjacent, which is the F at (0,9). That means none of the other surrounding squares can have a bomb. So (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) should all be safe. But (1,9) is a '.' which is unexplored, so maybe I can reveal that later.\n\nMoving to row 1: The revealed squares are (1,0) as 1, (1,1) as 1, (1,2) as 2, (1,3) as 1, (1,4) as 1, (1,5) as '_', (1,6) as '_', (1,7) as '_', (1,8) as 1, and (1,9) as '.'.\n\nLooking at (1,2) which is 2. It has a flag at (0,2) which is F, so that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb adjacent to (1,2). The adjacent squares to (1,2) are (0,1), (0,2) which is F, (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Since (0,2) is a flag, that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb in one of the remaining adjacent squares. Let's see if any of those are already revealed or flagged.\n\nLooking at (2,3) which is F, so that's another flag. So if (2,3) is a flag, that would be the second bomb adjacent to (1,2), making the count correct. But wait, (1,2) is 2, so it needs two bombs around it. If (0,2) is F and (2,3) is F, then that's two bombs, which fits. But wait, (2,3) is in row 2, column 3. Is that adjacent to (1,2)? Yes, because (1,2) is row 1, column 2. So (2,3) is diagonally adjacent. So that would satisfy the count of 2 for (1,2). So that seems okay.\n\nBut let me check if there are any conflicts elsewhere. For example, looking at row 2: (2,0) is F, (2,2) is F, (2,3) is F. So that's three flags in row 2. But the total bombs are 10, and I have 3 flags remaining, so I need to be careful not to place flags where they conflict with the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3: (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 2, (3,2) is F, (3,3) is 2, (3,4) is 1, and others are unexplored. Let's check (3,1) which is 2. It has a flag at (3,2). So that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb adjacent to (3,1). The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (3,2) is F, so that's one. So another bomb must be in one of the other squares. Let's see if any of those are already revealed or flagged.\n\n(2,0) is F, which is another flag. So that would be the second bomb adjacent to (3,1). So that works. So (3,1) is 2 with two flags adjacent: (3,2) and (2,0). That's correct.\n\nNow, looking at row 4: (4,1) is F, (4,3) is 1, (4,6) is '_', (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is 2. So (4,3) is 1, which means it has exactly one bomb adjacent. It has a flag at (4,1), but that's two columns away. Wait, (4,3) is at row 4, column 3. Its adjacent squares include (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (4,1) is at column 1, which is two columns away, so not adjacent. So the flag at (4,1) is not adjacent to (4,3). Therefore, the bomb adjacent to (4,3) must be in one of the other adjacent squares. Let's see if any of those are already flagged or revealed.\n\nLooking at (3,2) which is F. (3,2) is row 3, column 2. Is that adjacent to (4,3)? Yes, because (4,3) is row 4, column 3. So (3,2) is diagonally adjacent to (4,3). So that would be the one bomb adjacent to (4,3), making it correct. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at row 5: (5,0) is '_', (5,1) is 1, (5,2) is 1, (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is '_', (5,5) is F, (5,6) is 1, (5,7) is 2, (5,8) is '.', (5,9) is '.'.\n\nStarting with (5,1) which is 1. It has a flag at (5,5), but that's four columns away, so not adjacent. So the bomb must be in one of the adjacent squares: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). None of these are flagged except (4,1) which is F, but that's at row 4, column 1, which is adjacent to (5,1). So (4,1) is F, which is one bomb. Therefore, (5,1) is satisfied with one bomb adjacent. So no conflict there.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is 1. It has a flag at (4,1) which is adjacent. So that's the one bomb. So that's correct.\n\n(5,3) is 1. It's adjacent squares include (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,3) is 1, which is a number, not a flag. So the bomb must be in one of these. Let's see if any are flagged. (4,2) is '_', (4,3) is 1, (4,4) is '_', (5,2) is 1, (5,4) is '_', (6,2) is '_', (6,3) is '_', (6,4) is '_'. So no flags here. Therefore, the bomb must be in one of these. But since (5,3) is 1, there's exactly one bomb in these squares. But I can't see any flags here, so maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check (5,3) again. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,2): '_'\n- (4,3): '1'\n- (4,4): '_'\n- (5,2): '1'\n- (5,4): '_'\n- (6,2): '_'\n- (6,3): '_'\n- (6,4): '_'\n\nNone of these are flags except (4,1), which is not adjacent to (5,3). So the bomb must be in one of these. But since (5,3) is 1, there's exactly one bomb here. I don't see any flags, so maybe I need to consider that the bomb is in one of these squares, but it's not yet revealed.\n\nMoving on, (5,6) is 1. Its adjacent squares include (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (5,5) is F, which is a flag. So that's one bomb. Therefore, (5,6) is satisfied with that flag. So that's correct.\n\n(5,7) is 2. It has a flag at (5,5), which is two columns away. So that's one bomb. Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (5,7). Let's look at the adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,6): '_'\n- (4,7): '1'\n- (4,8): '2'\n- (5,6): '1'\n- (5,8): '.'\n- (6,6): '.'\n- (6,7): '.'\n- (6,8): '.'.\n\nNone of these are flags except (5,5), which is not adjacent. So the other bomb must be in one of these squares. But I don't see any flags, so maybe I need to look for other clues.\n\nNow, looking at row 6: (6,5) is 1, and others are mostly unexplored.\n\n(6,5) is 1, so it has exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,5) is F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares shouldn't have any bombs. So (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) should all be safe. But (5,6) is 1, which is okay because it's a number, not a bomb.\n\nMoving to row 7: (7,1) is 2, (7,2) is 2, (7,3) is 1, (7,4) is 1, (7,5) is 1, (7,6) is '.', (7,7) is '.', (7,8) is '.', (7,9) is '.'.\n\n(7,1) is 2. Its adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). None of these are flags except possibly (6,1), but (6,1) is '_'. So the two bombs must be in these squares. But I don't see any flags here, so maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\n(7,2) is 2. Its adjacent squares include (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). Again, no flags here, so the two bombs must be in these squares. But I can't see any flags, so maybe I need to look for other clues.\n\nRow 8: (8,1) is 1, others are mostly unexplored.\n\n(8,1) is 1, so exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). None of these are flags, so the bomb must be in one of these. But I don't see any flags, so maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nRow 9: (9,1) is 1, others are unexplored.\n\n(9,1) is 1, so exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,0), (10,1), (10,2). But since it's a 10x10 board, row 9 is the last row, so row 10 doesn't exist. So the adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). None of these are flags, so the bomb must be in one of these.\n\nNow, considering the total number of bombs: 10. Let's count the flags we have so far. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) is F.\n\nRow 1: No flags.\n\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,3) are F. That's three flags.\n\nRow 3: (3,2) is F.\n\nRow 4: (4,1) is F.\n\nRow 5: (5,5) is F.\n\nRow 6: No flags.\n\nRow 7: No flags.\n\nRow 8: No flags.\n\nRow 9: No flags.\n\nSo total flags placed so far: 1 (row 0) + 3 (row 2) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) +1 (row5) = 7 flags. But the user said flags remaining: 3. Wait, that can't be right because the total bombs are 10, so if we have 7 flags, and 3 remaining, that makes 10. So I must have miscounted.\n\nWait, the user provided the board state, and the flags are as marked with F. Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) F \u2192 1\n\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,3) \u2192 3\n\nRow 3: (3,2) \u21921\n\nRow 4: (4,1) \u21921\n\nRow 5: (5,5) \u21921\n\nThat's total of 1+3+1+1+1=7 flags. So with 3 remaining, that's correct because 7+3=10 bombs.\n\nSo I have 3 flags left to place.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to place the next flag or reveal a tile. Let me look for numbers that can help me deduce where the bombs are.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is 1, and column 9 is F. So that's one bomb accounted for.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 2 is 2, which is satisfied by (0,2) and (2,3) as F.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 1 is 2, which is satisfied by (3,2) and (2,0).\n\nRow 4, column 3 is 1, satisfied by (3,2).\n\nRow 5, column 7 is 2, which has (5,5) as F, so needs another bomb adjacent.\n\nRow 6, column 5 is 1, satisfied by (5,5).\n\nRow 7, column 1 is 2, needs two bombs adjacent. But no flags nearby, so perhaps the bombs are in (6,0) and (6,1), but those are unexplored.\n\nRow 8, column 1 is 1, needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nRow 9, column 1 is 1, needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nNow, looking for possible places to flag. Let me check if any numbers are conflicting with existing flags.\n\nFor example, looking at row 5, column 7 is 2, which has one flag at (5,5). So there must be another bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). Among these, (4,7) is 1, (5,6) is 1, (4,8) is 2, (5,8) is '.', (6,6) is '.', (6,7) is '.', (6,8) is '.'.\n\nSo the other bomb must be in one of these. Let's see if any of these are already revealed or can be deduced.\n\n(4,7) is 1, so it has one bomb adjacent, which is (5,5) as F. So (4,7) is satisfied. Therefore, the other bomb for (5,7) must be in (6,7) or (6,6) or (4,6) or (4,8) or (5,8). But (4,8) is 2, which is a number, so it's not a flag. (4,6) is '_', (5,8) is '.', (6,6) is '.', (6,7) is '.'.\n\nSo perhaps I can look at (6,7). If I reveal (6,7), maybe it's a number that can help. Alternatively, if I can find a square that must be a bomb based on the numbers, I can flag it.\n\nAnother approach: look for numbers that have only one possible square left for a bomb. For example, if a 1 has all but one square revealed as safe, then the remaining square must be the bomb.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 3 is 1. Its adjacent squares are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,3) is 1, (5,2) is 1, (4,2) is '_', (5,4) is '_', (6,2) is '_', (6,3) is '_', (6,4) is '_'. The bomb must be in one of these. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 5 is 1. Its adjacent squares include (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (6,5) is 1, (7,4) is 1, (7,5) is 1, (7,6) is '.', (8,5) is '.'.\n\nWait, (7,5) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares include (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). Among these, (7,4) is 1, (6,5) is 1. So the bomb must be in one of these. But (7,4) is 1, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. Similarly, (6,5) is 1. So the bomb must be in (6,4), (6,6), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), or (8,6). But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nLet me look for squares where placing a flag would satisfy multiple numbers. For example, if a square is adjacent to two numbers that both need a bomb there.\n\nLooking at (6,7): it's adjacent to (5,7) which is 2, needing another bomb, and (6,5) which is 1, which has a bomb at (5,5). So if (6,7) is a bomb, it would satisfy (5,7)'s count, but (6,5) is already satisfied by (5,5). So that could be a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (6,6): it's adjacent to (5,7) which is 2, and (6,5) which is 1, which is satisfied by (5,5). So (6,6) could be a bomb, making (5,7) have two bombs: (5,5) and (6,6). That would satisfy (5,7)'s count.\n\nBut I can't be sure. Alternatively, I can look for a square that, if revealed, would give me more information without risking hitting a bomb.\n\nAnother approach: check the numbers around the existing flags to ensure they don't conflict. For example, (2,3) is F. Let's see which numbers are adjacent to it.\n\n(2,3) is adjacent to (1,2) which is 2, (1,3) which is 1, (1,4) which is 1, (2,2) which is F, (2,4) which is '_', (3,2) which is F, (3,3) which is 2, (3,4) which is 1.\n\nWait, (3,3) is 2. It has flags at (2,3) and (3,2). So that's two flags, which satisfies the count of 2. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is 1, which has a flag at (2,3). So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking for a square where I can place a flag without conflicting with any numbers. Let's see.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 7 is 2, needing another bomb. The possible squares are (6,7), (6,6), (4,7), etc. Let me see if any of these are adjacent to other numbers that could help.\n\n(6,7) is adjacent to (5,7) which is 2, (6,5) which is 1, (6,6) which is '.', (5,6) which is 1, (7,6) which is '.', (7,7) which is '.'.\n\nIf I flag (6,7) as F, would that conflict with any numbers? Let's see.\n\n(5,7) would then have two bombs: (5,5) and (6,7), which is correct.\n\n(6,5) is 1, which has (5,5) as a bomb. If (6,7) is a bomb, does that affect (6,5)? No, because (6,5) is 1, and (5,5) is already a bomb. So that's okay.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is 1, which has (5,5) as a bomb. So that's okay.\n\nSo placing a flag at (6,7) seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for other squares. Let's see.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 2 is 2. It needs two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). None of these are flagged, so the two bombs must be in these squares. But I don't see any flags, so maybe I can't place a flag here yet.\n\nAnother option is to look at row 9, column 1 is 1. It needs one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). None of these are flagged, so the bomb must be in one of these. But I can't place a flag here without more info.\n\nSimilarly, row 8, column 1 is 1. It needs one bomb adjacent in (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). Again, no flags nearby.\n\nLooking back at row 5, column 7, I think placing a flag at (6,7) is a good move because it satisfies the count for (5,7) and doesn't conflict with any other numbers.\n\nSo, my next move would be to place a flag at (6,7).\n\nWait, but before placing a flag, I need to ensure that it doesn't conflict with any numbers. Let me check again.\n\nIf I place a flag at (6,7), then (5,7) would have two bombs: (5,5) and (6,7). That's correct.\n\nAlso, (6,5) is 1, which has (5,5) as a bomb, so that's okay.\n\nAdditionally, (6,7) is adjacent to (7,7), which is '.' and (7,6), which is '.'.\n\nSo, placing a flag at (6,7) seems safe and correct.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (6,7) satisfies the count for (5,7) which is 2, as it already has one flag at (5,5). This move doesn't conflict with any other revealed numbers.\n\nMOVE: 6,7,true", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 F .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 2 flags remaining, which means I can place two more flags if needed. My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without hitting any.\n\nLooking at the board, I see some numbers and some flagged squares. I remember that each number represents the count of bombs in the adjacent 8 squares. So, if a square has a '1', it means there's exactly one bomb around it. Similarly, a '2' means two bombs, and so on.\n\nI should start by checking the revealed numbers against the existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. Let's go through each row and column.\n\nStarting with row 0, I see that at (0,8) there's a '1', and (0,9) is a flag. Wait, no, (0,9) is just a '.', so maybe it's unexplored. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in row 0, the columns are labeled from 0 to 9. So (0,0) to (0,9). I see that (0,8) is '1' and (0,9) is 'F'. So that's a flag. So the '1' at (0,8) has a flag to its right. That means the '1' must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (0,9) is flagged, that's one bomb accounted for. So the '1' at (0,8) can't have any more bombs around it. So the other adjacent squares around (0,8) should be safe.\n\nWait, but (0,8) is at the top right, so its adjacent squares would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). But (0,7) is '_', which is revealed but empty. (1,7) is '_', (1,8) is '1', and (1,9) is '.'.\n\nSo the '1' at (0,8) already has a flag at (0,9). So the other adjacent squares must not have any bombs. So (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) should be safe. Wait, but (1,8) is a '1' as well. So that '1' at (1,8) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. It's adjacent to (0,8)'s '1' which is already accounted for by (0,9)'s flag. Hmm, maybe that's not a conflict, but I need to make sure.\n\nMoving on, let's look at row 1. At (1,0) there's a '1', (1,1) is '1', (1,2) is '2', and so on. Also, (1,8) is '1' and (1,9) is '.'.\n\nRow 2 has a 'F' at (2,0), which is a flag. Then (2,2) is 'F', another flag. (2,3) is 'F' as well. So that's three flags in row 2. Wait, but the user has only 2 flags remaining. Wait, no, the flags remaining are 2, but the board already has some flags. Let me count the flags on the board.\n\nLooking through the board, I see 'F's at (0,9), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (4,2), (5,5), and (6,7). That's 7 flags. Wait, but the game info says flags remaining: 2, and bombs:10. So total bombs are 10, and flags placed are 7, so remaining flags are 3? Wait, no, the game info says flags remaining: 2. So perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me count again. Row 0: (0,9) is 'F' \u2013 that's 1. Row 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,3) \u2013 that's 3 more, total 4. Row 4: (4,2) \u2013 5. Row5: (5,5) \u20136. Row6: (6,7) \u20137. So 7 flags on the board. But the game info says flags remaining: 2. So that means I've used 8 flags, but the total bombs are 10. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, perhaps the flags remaining is 2, meaning I can place 2 more. So I've placed 8 flags so far, but the total bombs are 10. Hmm, that seems off because each flag should correspond to a bomb. So maybe I've made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, the game info says bombs:10, so there are 10 bombs on the board. Flags remaining:2, so I can place 2 more. Therefore, I've already placed 8 flags. Let me recount the 'F's on the board.\n\nLooking again: (0,9) \u20131, (2,0), (2,2), (2,3) \u20134, (4,2) \u20135, (5,5) \u20136, (6,7) \u20137. So 7 flags. So I have 3 flags remaining because 10-7=3. But the game info says flags remaining:2. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow0: (0,9) \u20131.\n\nRow1: none.\n\nRow2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,3) \u20133.\n\nRow3: none.\n\nRow4: (4,2) \u20131.\n\nRow5: (5,5) \u20131.\n\nRow6: (6,7) \u20131.\n\nRows7-9: none.\n\nTotal: 1+3+1+1+1=7. So 7 flags. So with 10 bombs, I can place 3 more. But the game info says flags remaining:2. Maybe the game info is accurate, so perhaps I've miscounted. Alternatively, maybe some flags are incorrect and need to be removed.\n\nBut regardless, I need to proceed. Let's look for obvious conflicts between numbers and flags.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is '1', and (0,9) is 'F'. So the '1' at (0,8) has one bomb adjacent, which is at (0,9). So the other adjacent squares around (0,8) must be safe. So (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) should be safe. But (1,8) is '1', so that '1' must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (0,8) is '1', which is accounted for by (0,9)'s flag, then (1,8)'s '1' must have a bomb somewhere else.\n\nLooking at (1,8), its adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). We know (0,8) is '1', (0,9) is 'F', so the bomb for (1,8)'s '1' must be in one of the other squares. Let's see: (1,7) is '_', (1,9) is '.', (2,7) is '_', (2,8) is '1', (2,9) is '.'.\n\nWait, (2,8) is '1' as well. So (2,8)'s '1' must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square where the number and the flags around it don't add up. For example, if a '1' has two flags around it, that's a conflict because it can only have one bomb. Or if a '2' has only one flag, but the number requires another bomb.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 2 is 'F'. So (4,2) is flagged. Let's check the numbers around it. (3,1) is '2', (3,2) is 'F', (3,3) is '2', (4,1) is '1', (4,3) is '1', (5,1) is '1', (5,2) is '1', (5,3) is '1'. Wait, that seems like a lot of numbers around a flag.\n\nWait, (4,2) is a flag, so it's a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. For example, (3,1) is '2', which is adjacent to (4,2). So (3,1) must have exactly two bombs around it. One of them is (4,2). So there must be another bomb adjacent to (3,1). Let's see where that could be.\n\nThe adjacent squares to (3,1) are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). We know (4,2) is a bomb. So there must be another bomb in one of the other squares. Looking at (2,0) is 'F', which is another bomb. So (3,1)'s '2' is satisfied by (4,2) and (2,0). That makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is 'F', which is another bomb. So (3,2) is a bomb, which is adjacent to (3,1)'s '2'. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but (3,2) is 'F', which is a flag, so that's a bomb. So the square (3,2) is a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. For example, (2,1) is '.', (2,2) is 'F', (2,3) is 'F', (3,1) is '2', (3,3) is '2', (4,1) is '1', (4,2) is 'F', (4,3) is '1'. So (3,2) being a bomb affects the counts of its neighbors. For example, (2,1) is adjacent to (3,2), so if (2,1) is a number, it should reflect that. But (2,1) is '.' so it's unexplored.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a square where the number plus the flags don't add up correctly. Let's see.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5 is 'F'. So (5,5) is a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. For example, (4,4) is '_', (4,5) is '_', (4,6) is '_', (5,4) is '_', (5,6) is 'F', (6,4) is '_', (6,5) is '1', (6,6) is '.'.\n\nWait, (5,6) is 'F', so that's another bomb. So (5,5) and (5,6) are both bombs. Let's check the numbers around them. For example, (6,5) is '1', which is adjacent to (5,5) and (5,6). So (6,5)'s '1' must have exactly one bomb adjacent. But both (5,5) and (5,6) are bombs, so that would make (6,5) have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts its '1'. That's a problem.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So (6,5) is '1', but it's adjacent to two bombs: (5,5) and (5,6). That's a conflict because a '1' should only have one bomb adjacent. So this suggests that either (5,5) or (5,6) shouldn't be a bomb, or (6,5) is incorrectly numbered.\n\nBut according to the board, (5,5) and (5,6) are both 'F's, meaning they're flagged as bombs. So this is a conflict. That means one of these flags is incorrectly placed. Therefore, I need to remove one of these flags because they can't both be bombs if (6,5) is '1'.\n\nSo the next move should be to remove one of these flags. Let's see which one is more likely to be incorrect.\n\nLooking at (5,5): it's adjacent to (6,5)'s '1', which would require that only one bomb is adjacent. But if (5,5) is a bomb, then (5,6) can't be because that would give two bombs adjacent to (6,5). Alternatively, if (5,6) is a bomb, then (5,5) can't be.\n\nBut wait, (5,6) is also adjacent to (6,6), which is '.', and (6,5) is '1'. So if (5,6) is a bomb, then (6,5)'s '1' is correct because it's only adjacent to (5,6). But (5,5) is also a bomb, which would make (6,5) have two bombs adjacent, which is a problem.\n\nTherefore, the conflict arises because both (5,5) and (5,6) are flagged, but (6,5) is '1'. So one of these flags is wrong. I need to decide which one to remove.\n\nLooking at the board, perhaps (5,6) is the one that's incorrectly flagged. Let me check the numbers around (5,6). (5,6) is 'F', so it's a bomb. Let's see what numbers are around it. (4,5) is '_', (4,6) is '_', (5,5) is 'F', (5,7) is '2', (6,5) is '1', (6,6) is '.'.\n\nSo (5,7) is '2', which is adjacent to (5,6). So (5,7)'s '2' must have two bombs adjacent. One is (5,6), so there must be another bomb adjacent to (5,7). Let's see where that could be.\n\nThe adjacent squares to (5,7) are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). We know (5,6) is a bomb, so another bomb must be in one of these squares. Looking at (6,7) is 'F', which is a bomb. So (6,7) is a bomb, which is adjacent to (5,7). Therefore, (5,7)'s '2' is satisfied by (5,6) and (6,7). So that's correct.\n\nBut if (5,6) is a bomb, then (6,5)'s '1' is invalid because it would have two bombs adjacent: (5,5) and (5,6). Therefore, (5,5) must not be a bomb. So perhaps (5,5) is incorrectly flagged.\n\nWait, but (5,5) is 'F', so it's considered a bomb. Let's check the numbers around (5,5). (4,4) is '_', (4,5) is '_', (4,6) is '_', (5,4) is '_', (5,6) is 'F', (6,4) is '_', (6,5) is '1', (6,6) is '.'.\n\nSo (5,5) being a bomb affects (6,5)'s '1', which would require only one bomb adjacent. But if both (5,5) and (5,6) are bombs, then (6,5) has two bombs adjacent, which is a problem. Therefore, one of them must not be a bomb.\n\nGiven that (5,7)'s '2' requires two bombs, and (5,6) is one, and (6,7) is another, that's correct. So (5,6) must be a bomb, which means (5,5) cannot be a bomb because that would cause (6,5) to have two bombs adjacent.\n\nTherefore, (5,5) must not be a bomb, so the flag there is incorrect. So I should remove the flag at (5,5).\n\nSo the next move would be to remove the flag at (5,5). That would fix the conflict with (6,5)'s '1'.\n\nSo the move would be to make a move with flag=true on (5,5), which would remove the flag because it's already flagged.\n\nBut wait, according to the rules, to remove a flag, you make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So the move would be (5,5), flag=true.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct way. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal (5,5) as a safe square, but that would require flag=false. But since it's currently flagged, I can't reveal it without removing the flag first.\n\nWait, the rules say that to remove a flag, you make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So yes, the move would be (5,5), flag=true, which would remove the flag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (5,5) by setting flag=false, but since it's already flagged, I can't reveal it without unflagging it first.\n\nSo the correct move is to remove the flag at (5,5) by setting flag=true there.\n\nTherefore, the next move is to remove the flag at (5,5).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The flag at (5,5) conflicts with the '1' at (6,5), which can only have one adjacent bomb. Since (5,6) is also a bomb, (5,5) must be incorrectly flagged. Removing this flag resolves the conflict.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,true", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 F .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 1, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has 3 flags remaining, which means they've already placed some flags on the board. My goal is to decide whether to reveal a tile or place a flag next, making sure not to conflict with the existing numbers and flags.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice several revealed numbers and some flags (marked as F). I should start by checking each revealed number to see if any of them conflict with the existing flags. If a number shows a '1', for example, and there are already two flags adjacent to it, that's a conflict because the number indicates exactly one bomb nearby.\n\nLet me go row by row to spot any obvious issues.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- At (0,8), there's a '1'. The surrounding tiles are mostly unexplored except for (0,9) which is a '.' and (1,8) which is '1'. Since it's a '1', there should be exactly one bomb adjacent. But I don't see any flags around it yet, so that's fine.\n\nRow 1:\n- (1,0) is '1', (1,1) is '1', (1,2) is '2', and (1,8) is '1'. Let's check each:\n  - (1,0): Adjacent tiles are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (1,1) is '1', so maybe the bomb is near there. Not seeing any flags here yet.\n  - (1,1): Adjacent to (1,0) and (1,2). (1,2) is '2', so maybe the bomb is near (1,2).\n  - (1,2) is '2', so there should be two bombs around it. Adjacent tiles include (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). There's a flag at (2,2), so that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb nearby. Maybe (0,2) or (2,3), but not sure yet.\n\nRow 2:\n- (2,0) is 'F', (2,2) is 'F', (2,3) is 'F'. Wait, that's three flags in a row. But the player only has 3 flags remaining, so maybe they placed these. But I need to check if these flags are conflicting with any numbers.\n\nLooking at row 2, (2,0) is a flag. Let's see the adjacent numbers. The tile above it is (1,0), which is '1'. If (1,0) is '1' and there's a flag at (2,0), then (1,0)'s adjacent bomb count is satisfied, so that's okay.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is a flag. Let's check the adjacent numbers. The tile above is (1,2), which is '2'. Since (2,2) is a flag (bomb), that counts as one of the two bombs needed for (1,2). So (1,2) needs another bomb nearby.\n\nNow, (2,3) is a flag. Let's check the adjacent numbers. The tile above is (1,3), which is '2'. So (1,3) is '2' and has a flag at (2,3). That counts as one bomb, so there must be another bomb adjacent to (1,3).\n\nRow 3:\n- (3,0) is '1', (3,1) is '2', (3,2) is 'F', (3,3) is '2', (3,4) is '1'. Let's check these:\n  - (3,0) is '1'. Its adjacent tiles include (2,0), which is a flag. So that's one bomb, which satisfies the '1'. So no conflict here.\n  - (3,1) is '2'. Adjacent tiles include (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) and (2,2) are flags, so that's two bombs, which matches the '2'. So that's okay.\n  - (3,2) is a flag. Let's see the adjacent numbers. The tile above is (2,2), which is a flag, so that's already accounted for. The tile to the right is (3,3), which is '2'. So (3,3) is '2', and it's adjacent to (3,2) as a flag. So (3,3) needs another bomb nearby.\n\nRow 4:\n- (4,1) is 'F', (4,3) is '1', (4,6) is '1', (4,7) is '2', (4,8) is '2'. Let's check these:\n  - (4,1) is a flag. The tile above is (3,1), which is '2'. Since (4,1) is a flag, that counts towards (3,1)'s '2' requirement. (3,1) already has (2,0) and (2,2) as flags, so that's two bombs. So (4,1) being a flag might conflict because (3,1) is already satisfied. Wait, that's a problem. If (3,1) is '2' and it's adjacent to two flags (2,0 and 2,2), then placing another flag at (4,1) would mean that (3,1) is adjacent to three flags, which contradicts the '2' because each flag represents a bomb. So this is a conflict. Therefore, the flag at (4,1) is incorrectly placed because (3,1) can't have three bombs adjacent. So maybe (4,1) shouldn't be a flag. This is a critical issue.\n\nSimilarly, looking at row 5:\n- (5,1) is '1', (5,2) is '1', (5,3) is '1', (5,5) is '1', (5,6) is '1', (5,7) is '2', (5,8) is '.'.\n\nRow 6:\n- (6,5) is '1', (6,7) is 'F'.\n\nRow 7:\n- (7,1) is '2', (7,2) is '2', (7,3) is '1', (7,4) is '1', (7,5) is '1', (7,6) is '.'.\n\nRow 8 and 9 are mostly unexplored.\n\nNow, focusing back on row 4, (4,1) is a flag, but (3,1) is '2' which is already adjacent to two flags (2,0 and 2,2). Therefore, (4,1) being a flag is incorrect because it adds a third bomb adjacent to (3,1), which can't be since (3,1) is '2'. So the flag at (4,1) is a mistake and should be removed.\n\nSo my next move should be to remove the flag at (4,1). That would free up a flag, and also correct the conflict with (3,1)'s '2'.\n\nAlternatively, I could check if there are any other conflicts, but this seems like the most pressing one. Removing the flag at (4,1) would resolve the conflict, allowing me to place flags correctly elsewhere if needed.\n\nAnother consideration is the remaining flags. Since the player has 3 flags remaining, and I'm removing one, that would leave 4 flags in total. But the total bombs are 10, so I need to make sure that all bombs are correctly flagged without conflicting with the numbers.\n\nWait, actually, the player has 3 flags remaining, meaning they've already placed some flags. Let me count the flags on the board.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: (0,8) is '1', (0,9) is '.'.\n\nRow 1: (1,8) is '1'.\n\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,3) are F. That's three flags.\n\nRow 3: (3,2) is F.\n\nRow 4: (4,1) is F.\n\nRow 6: (6,7) is F.\n\nSo total flags on the board: 2 (row2) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) +1 (row6) = 5 flags. But the game info says flags remaining: 3, which means the player has placed 10 - 3 = 7 flags? Wait, no. Wait, the total bombs are 10, and the flags remaining are 3, meaning the player has placed 10 - 3 = 7 flags. But looking at the board, I count 5 flags. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 0: none.\n\nRow 1: none.\n\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,3) \u2192 3 flags.\n\nRow 3: (3,2) \u2192 1.\n\nRow 4: (4,1) \u2192 1.\n\nRow 6: (6,7) \u21921.\n\nTotal: 3+1+1+1=6 flags. So the player has placed 6 flags, and has 3 remaining, which makes sense since total bombs are 10.\n\nWait, but if I remove the flag at (4,1), that would bring the flags down to 5, and the remaining would be 4. But perhaps that's necessary to correct the conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for other potential conflicts.\n\nLooking at (6,7), which is a flag. Let's check the adjacent numbers. The tile above is (5,7), which is '2'. So (5,7) is '2', and it's adjacent to (6,7) as a flag. Therefore, (5,7) needs another bomb nearby. So that's okay.\n\nAnother spot: (0,8) is '1'. It's adjacent to (0,9) which is '.' and (1,8) which is '1'. So (0,8)'s '1' could be satisfied by a bomb at (1,8), but (1,8) is a '1', which suggests that it has one bomb adjacent. So if (1,8) is '1', and it's adjacent to (0,8) which is '1', perhaps the bomb is somewhere else. Maybe (1,7) or (2,8). Not sure yet.\n\nBack to the main issue: (4,1) is a flag, causing a conflict with (3,1)'s '2'. So I should remove that flag.\n\nSo the next move would be to remove the flag at (4,1). That would correct the conflict and free up a flag for correct placement elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place a flag somewhere else that doesn't conflict, but given the analysis, the priority is to fix the conflict first.\n\nSo, the move would be to remove the flag at (4,1), which is (x=4, y=1), and set flag=true because I'm removing a flag (since flag=true is to place or remove, and to remove, I think you have to set flag=true on an already flagged square).\n\nWait, according to the rules: To remove a flag, make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So yes, the move would be (4,1) with flag=true to remove it.\n\nBut wait, I think the move format is x,y,flag. So if I want to remove the flag, I set flag=true, which would toggle it. So the move would be (4,1,true).\n\nBut wait, in the initial state, (4,1) is already flagged. So sending flag=true would remove it. So that's the correct move.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be to remove the flag at (4,1) to resolve the conflict with (3,1)'s '2'.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The flag at (4,1) conflicts with the '2' at (3,1), which already has two adjacent flags. Removing it resolves this conflict.\nMOVE: 4,1,true", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 F .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 2, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board state and the game info provided.\n\nThe board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 2 flags remaining, which means I can place two more flags if needed. My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs without hitting a mine.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares are already revealed with numbers, some are flagged (marked with F), and others are still unexplored (marked with .). My first step is to analyze the revealed numbers to see if any conflicts arise with the existing flags.\n\nStarting from the top, in row 0, I see that position (0,8) is a 1, and (0,9) is flagged. Since a 1 indicates exactly one adjacent bomb, I need to check if the flag at (0,9) is the only bomb adjacent to (0,8). The square (0,8) is a 1, so it should have exactly one bomb in its eight surrounding squares. The flag at (0,9) is to the right of (0,8), so that's one bomb. Now, I should check if there are any other bombs adjacent to (0,8) that might conflict with this.\n\nLooking at row 0, columns 0-7 are either empty or have numbers, but no other flags. So, (0,8) is okay for now. Moving on, row 1 has several numbers and flags. For example, (1,0) is 1, (1,1) is 1, (1,2) is 2, and so on. I should check if any of these numbers are conflicting with the flags.\n\nIn row 1, (1,0) is 1, which means it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The square above it is (0,0), which is empty, and to the right is (1,1), which is 1. So, perhaps the bomb is either at (0,1) or (1,0)'s other neighbors. But (0,1) is empty, so maybe the bomb is below or somewhere else. I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 2, I see (2,0) is F, so that's a flag. The square at (2,0) is flagged, so it's considered a bomb. The square (1,0) is 1, which should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0) is a flag (bomb), that satisfies the 1 at (1,0). So that seems okay.\n\nMoving on, in row 3, (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 2, etc. I should check if any of these numbers are conflicting with existing flags. For example, (3,1) is 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. Let me see: the squares around (3,1) include (2,0) which is a flag, (2,1) which is empty, (3,0) which is 1, (3,2) which is F, (4,0), (4,1), etc. Wait, (3,2) is F, so that's another flag. So, the square (3,1) is 2, and it has two flags adjacent: (2,0) and (3,2). That would mean two bombs, which fits the 2. So that seems okay.\n\nWait, but (3,1) is 2, and it's adjacent to (2,0) and (3,2), both flags. So that's two bombs, which matches the number. So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at row 4, (4,1) is F, (4,2) is F, so two flags there. The square (4,0) is empty, (4,3) is 1. So, (4,3) is 1, meaning it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The squares around (4,3) include (3,2) which is F, (3,3) which is 2, (4,2) which is F, (5,2), (5,3), etc. So, (4,3) is 1, but it's adjacent to two flags: (3,2) and (4,2). That would mean two bombs, which contradicts the 1. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, that's a conflict. The square at (4,3) is 1, but it's adjacent to two flags at (3,2) and (4,2). That would imply that there are two bombs adjacent, but the number says 1. That's a conflict. So either one of those flags is incorrect, or perhaps the number is wrong, but since the number is given, the flags must be incorrect.\n\nBut wait, the flags are placed by the player, so maybe one of them is mistakenly placed. So I need to check if (3,2) or (4,2) should not be flags.\n\nLooking at (3,2), which is F. The square (3,1) is 2, which is adjacent to (3,2). So (3,1) is 2, and it's adjacent to (2,0) F and (3,2) F, which gives two bombs, which is correct. So if (3,2) is a flag, then (3,1) is okay. But (4,3) is 1, and it's adjacent to (3,2) F and (4,2) F, which is two bombs, conflicting with the 1. Therefore, one of those flags must be wrong.\n\nBut since (3,1) is 2 and correctly has two flags adjacent, (3,2) must be correct. Therefore, the problem must be with (4,2). So (4,2) is F, but (4,3) is 1, which is adjacent to (4,2). So if (4,2) is a flag, then (4,3) would have at least one bomb adjacent, which is fine, but (4,3) is 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. However, (4,3) is also adjacent to (3,2) F, so that's two bombs, which is a conflict.\n\nTherefore, the flag at (4,2) must be incorrect because it's causing (4,3) to have two bombs adjacent, but (4,3) is 1. So perhaps (4,2) is not a bomb, and the flag there is wrong. So I should consider removing the flag at (4,2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe (3,2) is not a bomb, but that would cause (3,1) to have only one bomb (from (2,0)), but (3,1) is 2, so that's not possible. Therefore, (3,2) must be a bomb, so the problem is with (4,2). Therefore, (4,2) is not a bomb and should not be flagged.\n\nSo my next move should be to remove the flag at (4,2). That would resolve the conflict because (4,3) would then only have one bomb adjacent (at (3,2)), which matches its value of 1.\n\nSo, the move would be to go to (4,2) and remove the flag. Since the current state has (4,2) as F, I can remove it by making a move with flag=true on that square, but wait, the rules say that to remove a flag, you make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (4,2) instead, but if it's a flag, I can't reveal it. So to remove the flag, I have to flag it again, which would toggle it.\n\nWait, in Minesweeper, to remove a flag, you right-click again, which toggles it. So in the move format, I can specify flag=true for a square that's already flagged to remove it.\n\nSo, the move would be (4,2), flag=true, which would remove the flag there.\n\nLet me check again: (4,3) is 1, adjacent to (3,2) F and (4,2) F. That's two bombs, which is a conflict. So removing one of the flags would fix it. Since (3,2) is necessary for (3,1) to be 2, (4,2) must be the one to remove.\n\nTherefore, the next move is to remove the flag at (4,2).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The square at (4,3) is marked as 1, indicating it should have exactly one adjacent bomb. However, it's adjacent to two flags at (3,2) and (4,2), which is a conflict. Since (3,2) is necessary for (3,1) to be correct, the flag at (4,2) must be incorrect and should be removed.\n\nMOVE: 4,2,true", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 8, "y": 2, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let's start by looking at the board and the information provided.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 3 flags remaining, so I need to be careful where I place them. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without hitting a mine.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice that some squares are already revealed with numbers, some are flagged, and others are still unexplored. I should probably start by checking the revealed numbers to see if any of them conflict with the existing flags. That's one of the critical rules\u2014each number must exactly match the number of adjacent bombs, no more, no less.\n\nLet me go through each revealed number and see if the adjacent flags make sense.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 8, which is a 1. It's at position (0,8). The surrounding squares would be (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). Looking at the board, (0,9) is a flag (F), so that counts as one bomb adjacent to (0,8). But the number is 1, so there should be exactly one bomb around it. Since there's already a flag at (0,9), that should be the only bomb adjacent. So that seems okay for now.\n\nNext, in row 1, columns 0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9. Let's see:\n\n- (1,0) is 1. Its adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). None of these are flagged, so that's fine. The 1 indicates there's one bomb around it, which could be in any of those squares.\n\n- (1,1) is 1. Adjacent squares include (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). No flags nearby, so that's okay.\n\n- (1,2) is 2. Adjacent squares include (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). No flags here, so that's fine.\n\n- (1,3) is 1. Adjacent squares include (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). No flags nearby.\n\n- (1,4) is 1. Adjacent squares include (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). No flags here.\n\n- (1,7) is 1. Adjacent squares include (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). (0,8) is a 1, but (0,9) is a flag, so maybe that's the bomb adjacent to (1,7). So that's okay.\n\n- (1,8) is 1. Adjacent squares include (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). (0,9) is a flag, so that's the bomb, which matches the 1.\n\n- (1,9) is a flag, so that's already accounted for.\n\nMoving to row 2, columns 0,3,4,5,7,8,9. Let's check each:\n\n- (2,0) is F, so it's a flag.\n\n- (2,3) is F, another flag.\n\n- (2,4) is 1. Its adjacent squares include (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (2,3) is a flag, so that's one bomb. The number is 1, so that's correct.\n\n- (2,5) is 1. Adjacent squares include (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). (2,4) is 1, but that's a number, not a flag. So that's okay.\n\n- (2,7) is 1. Adjacent squares include (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). (1,8) is 1, but that's a number, not a flag. So that's fine.\n\n- (2,8) is 2. Adjacent squares include (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). (1,9) is a flag, so that's one bomb. Since the number is 2, there must be another bomb adjacent. So maybe (2,9) is a bomb? Or another adjacent square.\n\n- (2,9) is a flag, so that's another bomb. Wait, but (2,8) is 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. If (2,9) is a flag, that's one, and (1,9) is another flag, so that's two. So that works. So (2,8) is 2, and it's adjacent to two flags, which is correct.\n\nRow 3: columns 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\n- (3,0) is 1. Adjacent squares: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb, which matches the 1.\n\n- (3,1) is 2. Adjacent squares: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb. The number is 2, so there must be another bomb adjacent. Maybe (4,0) or (4,1) is a bomb? Or (2,1) or (2,2)?\n\n- (3,2) is F, a flag.\n\n- (3,3) is 2. Adjacent squares: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (3,2) is a flag, so that's one bomb. The number is 2, so another bomb must be adjacent. Maybe (2,3) is a flag, but wait, (2,3) is a flag, so that's two bombs? Wait, (3,3) is 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. (3,2) is one, and (2,3) is another. So that works.\n\n- (3,4) is 1. Adjacent squares: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is a flag, so that's one bomb, which matches the 1.\n\n- (3,7) is 1. Adjacent squares: (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). (2,7) is 1, which is a number, not a flag. So that's fine.\n\n- (3,8) is 1. Adjacent squares: (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). (2,8) is 2, which is a number, so that's okay.\n\nRow 4:\n\n- (4,1) is F, a flag.\n\n- (4,3) is 1. Adjacent squares: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (3,2) is a flag, so that's one bomb, which matches the 1.\n\n- (4,6) is 1. Adjacent squares: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). No flags nearby, so that's okay.\n\n- (4,7) is 2. Adjacent squares: (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (4,6) is 1, which is a number, not a flag. So that's fine.\n\nRow 5:\n\n- (5,0) is F, a flag.\n\n- (5,1) is 1. Adjacent squares: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (5,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb, which matches the 1.\n\n- (5,2) is 1. Adjacent squares: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (4,1) is a flag, so that's one bomb, which matches the 1.\n\n- (5,5) is 1. Adjacent squares: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). No flags nearby, so that's okay.\n\n- (5,6) is 1. Adjacent squares: (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (4,6) is 1, which is a number, so that's okay.\n\nRow 6:\n\n- (6,5) is 1. Adjacent squares: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). No flags nearby, so that's okay.\n\n- (6,6) is F, a flag.\n\nRow 7:\n\n- (7,1) is 2. Adjacent squares: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). No flags nearby, so that's okay.\n\n- (7,2) is 2. Adjacent squares: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). No flags nearby.\n\n- (7,3) is 1. Adjacent squares: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). No flags nearby.\n\nRow 8:\n\n- (8,1) is 1. Adjacent squares: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). No flags nearby.\n\nRow 9:\n\n- (9,1) is 1. Adjacent squares: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). No flags nearby.\n\nNow, let's check for any obvious conflicts. For example, any number that has more flags around it than its value. Let's see:\n\nLooking at (0,8) which is 1. It has one flag at (0,9), which is correct.\n\n(1,0) is 1 with no flags nearby, correct.\n\n(1,2) is 2 with no flags nearby, correct.\n\n(2,8) is 2 with two flags, (1,9) and (2,9), correct.\n\n(3,1) is 2 with one flag at (2,0). So it needs another bomb adjacent. Maybe (4,0) is a bomb? Or (4,1) is a flag, but (4,1) is a flag, so that's another bomb. Wait, (3,1) is 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. (2,0) is one, and (4,1) is another. So that works.\n\n(3,3) is 2 with two flags at (3,2) and (2,3), correct.\n\n(4,3) is 1 with a flag at (3,2), correct.\n\n(4,7) is 2 with no flags, but maybe it's adjacent to two bombs elsewhere.\n\n(5,1) is 1 with a flag at (5,0), correct.\n\n(5,2) is 1 with a flag at (4,1), correct.\n\n(7,1) is 2 with no flags, so needs two bombs nearby.\n\n(7,2) is 2 with no flags, so needs two bombs nearby.\n\n(8,1) is 1 with no flags, correct.\n\n(9,1) is 1 with no flags, correct.\n\nNow, considering the total number of bombs: 10. Let's count the flags placed so far. Flags are at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (2,9), (4,1), (5,0), (6,6). That's 7 flags. Wait, but the game info says flags remaining: 3. Wait, that can't be right because I can only have 10 bombs, and I've already placed 7 flags. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount the flags:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) is F.\n\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,3), (2,9) are F.\n\nRow 4: (4,1) is F.\n\nRow 5: (5,0) is F.\n\nRow 6: (6,6) is F.\n\nSo that's 1 (row0) + 3 (row2) +1 (row4) +1 (row5) +1 (row6) = 7 flags. But the game info says flags remaining:3, which probably means I've used 7 flags, and I have 3 left to place because there are 10 bombs in total. So I have to place 3 more flags.\n\nWait, no. The game info says \"Flags remaining: 3\", meaning I have 3 left to place. So total flags placed so far would be 10 - 3 = 7, which matches what I counted. So I can place 3 more flags.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to place the next flag. I should look for squares that must be bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLooking for squares that are adjacent to numbers that have all their bombs accounted for except one, which would indicate that the square must be a bomb.\n\nFor example, let's look at (3,1) which is 2. It's adjacent to (2,0) which is a flag, and (4,1) which is a flag. So that's two bombs, which matches the 2. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at (2,8) which is 2, adjacent to two flags, so that's correct.\n\nLooking at (1,7) which is 1, adjacent to (0,8) which is 1, and (0,9) which is a flag. So that's one bomb, correct.\n\nLooking at (3,3) which is 2, adjacent to two flags, correct.\n\nLooking at (5,1) which is 1, adjacent to (5,0) which is a flag, correct.\n\n(5,2) is 1, adjacent to (4,1) which is a flag, correct.\n\n(4,3) is 1, adjacent to (3,2) which is a flag, correct.\n\n(0,8) is 1, adjacent to (0,9) which is a flag, correct.\n\nNow, let's look for a square that is adjacent to a number that requires a bomb to be there.\n\nFor example, let's look at (7,1) which is 2. It's adjacent to (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). None of these are flagged yet, so it needs two bombs in these squares.\n\nSimilarly, (7,2) is 2, adjacent to (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). No flags here.\n\nLooking at (4,7) which is 2. Adjacent squares: (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (5,6) is 1, which is a number, not a flag. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at (2,4) which is 1, adjacent to (2,3) which is a flag, correct.\n\nNow, perhaps I should look for a square that is adjacent to a number that can only be satisfied by placing a flag there.\n\nFor example, let's look at (3,1) which is 2. It's adjacent to (2,0) and (4,1), both flags, so that's correct.\n\nLooking at (3,3) which is 2, adjacent to (3,2) and (2,3), both flags, correct.\n\nLooking at (5,1) which is 1, adjacent to (5,0) which is a flag, correct.\n\nLooking at (5,2) which is 1, adjacent to (4,1) which is a flag, correct.\n\nLooking at (4,3) which is 1, adjacent to (3,2) which is a flag, correct.\n\nLooking at (0,8) which is 1, adjacent to (0,9) which is a flag, correct.\n\nNow, let's look at (6,6) which is a flag. It's at (6,6). Adjacent squares: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,6) is 1, which is a number, so that's okay.\n\nLooking at (2,9) which is a flag. Adjacent squares: (1,8), (1,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9). (1,8) is 1, which is a number, correct.\n\nLooking at (1,9) which is a flag. Adjacent squares: (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9). (0,8) is 1, (1,8) is 1, (2,8) is 2. So that's okay.\n\nNow, perhaps I can look for a square that is adjacent to a number that can only be satisfied by placing a flag.\n\nLooking at (7,1) which is 2. It needs two bombs adjacent. Maybe (8,0) is a bomb? Or (8,1)?\n\nAlternatively, looking at (8,1) which is 1. It's adjacent to (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). If (8,1) is 1, then there must be exactly one bomb in these squares. If I can find a square that must be a bomb based on other numbers, I can flag it.\n\nLooking at (9,1) which is 1. It's adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). So if (9,1) is 1, there must be one bomb in these squares.\n\nSimilarly, (8,1) is 1, so one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nIf I can find a square that is adjacent to both (8,1) and (9,1), and must be a bomb, that would help.\n\nFor example, if (9,0) is a bomb, then (8,1) would have that as one bomb, and (9,1) would also have that as one bomb. But that would satisfy both, but maybe that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (8,2) is a bomb. Then (8,1) would have that as one bomb, and (9,1) would have (8,2) as one bomb. But (9,1) is 1, so that would be okay.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me see if there are other squares that must be bombs.\n\nLooking at (7,1) which is 2. It needs two bombs in its adjacent squares. Suppose I place a flag at (8,1). Then (7,1) would have one bomb, but it needs two. So that's not enough.\n\nAlternatively, if I place a flag at (8,0), then (7,1) would have one bomb, but it still needs another.\n\nAlternatively, if I place a flag at (7,0), but that's unexplored.\n\nWait, maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0. It's unexplored, but adjacent to (0,1) which is 1. So if (0,0) is a bomb, then (0,1) would have two bombs adjacent, which is more than its value of 1. So (0,0) can't be a bomb. Therefore, (0,0) must be safe. But I can't flag it because it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, (0,1) is 1. If (0,0) is safe, then the bomb must be in (0,2), (1,0), or (1,1). But I can't be sure yet.\n\nLooking at (1,0) which is 1. It's adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (2,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So (1,0)'s number is satisfied.\n\nLooking at (2,1) which is F. Wait, no, (2,1) is a dot, unexplored. Wait, no, looking back at the board, row 2, column 1 is a dot. So (2,1) is unexplored.\n\nWait, no, the board shows row 2 as: F . F F 1 _ _ 1 2 . So (2,0) is F, (2,1) is ., (2,2) is F, etc.\n\nSo (1,0) is 1, and (2,0) is a flag, so that's the one bomb. So (1,0) is satisfied.\n\nLooking at (1,1) which is 1. It's adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (2,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb, which matches the 1.\n\nSo (1,1) is satisfied.\n\nLooking at (1,2) which is 2. It's adjacent to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (2,2) is F and (2,3) is F, so that's two bombs. So (1,2) is satisfied.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nLooking at (1,3) which is 1. It's adjacent to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (2,2) is F and (2,3) is F, so that's two bombs, but (1,3) is 1, which would be a conflict. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, (1,3) is 1, but it's adjacent to two flags at (2,2) and (2,3). That would mean two bombs, which contradicts the 1. So that's a conflict. So that can't be right. So either (2,2) or (2,3) is not a bomb, or (1,3) is incorrect. But that's impossible because the board is given as is.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Let me check again.\n\n(1,3) is 1, which means exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. But looking at the board, (2,2) and (2,3) are both flags, which are bombs. So that's two bombs adjacent to (1,3), which is a 1. That's a conflict. So that suggests that either (2,2) or (2,3) is not a bomb, which can't be because they're flagged.\n\nWait, this is a critical issue. So according to the board, (1,3) is 1, but it's adjacent to two flags, which would mean two bombs, which is impossible. So that suggests that either the flags at (2,2) or (2,3) are incorrectly placed, or (1,3) is incorrect. But since the board is given, I have to work with it.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the adjacent squares for (1,3):\n\n(1,3) is at row 1, column 3.\n\nAdjacent squares are:\n\n(0,2), (0,3), (0,4),\n\n(1,2), (1,4),\n\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nSo (2,2) is F, (2,3) is F, and (2,4) is 1.\n\nSo (1,3) is adjacent to two flags, which would mean two bombs, but (1,3) is 1. That's a conflict. So this suggests that one of the flags is incorrect, or the number is wrong. But since the board is given, I have to assume that the flags are correctly placed, so perhaps (1,3) is not 1 but higher. But that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the board. Let me look again.\n\nThe board is given as:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 F . F F 1 _ _ 1 2 .\n3 1 2 F 2 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n4 _ F . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F . .\n7 _ 1 2 2 1 1 . . . .\n8 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n9 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nSo row 1 is: 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n\nSo (1,3) is 2, not 1. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo (1,3) is 2, not 1. That changes things. So (1,3) is 2, and it's adjacent to (2,2) and (2,3), which are both flags. So that's two bombs, which matches the 2. So no conflict there. That was my mistake earlier.\n\nOkay, that's a relief. So no conflict there.\n\nNow, looking back, perhaps I should look for a square that is adjacent to a number that can only be satisfied by placing a flag.\n\nLooking at (7,1) which is 2. It needs two bombs in its adjacent squares. Let's see the adjacent squares: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). None of these are flagged yet.\n\nLooking at (8,1) which is 1. It needs one bomb in its adjacent squares: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). If I can place a flag in one of these squares, that would satisfy (8,1)'s requirement.\n\nSimilarly, (9,1) is 1, adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). So placing a flag in one of these would satisfy both (8,1) and (9,1).\n\nLooking at (8,0), which is unexplored. If I place a flag there, it would satisfy both (8,1) and (9,1). But I need to check if that's consistent with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, placing a flag at (8,2) would satisfy (8,1) and (9,1), but let's check if that's possible.\n\nWait, but (8,2) is adjacent to (7,1) which is 2, so if (8,2) is a bomb, that would count towards (7,1)'s count. So (7,1) needs two bombs. If (8,2) is a bomb, that's one, and maybe another.\n\nAlternatively, if I place a flag at (7,0), that would satisfy (8,1) and (9,1), but also affect (7,1)'s count.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf I place a flag at (8,0), then:\n\n- (8,1) would have one bomb, which is correct.\n\n- (9,1) would have one bomb, correct.\n\n- (7,1) would have one bomb, but it needs two, so another bomb must be adjacent to (7,1).\n\nSo (7,1) is 2, so if (8,0) is a bomb, then another bomb must be in (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,2), (8,1), (8,2). But (8,1) is 1, so it can't have another bomb. So perhaps (7,2) is a bomb.\n\nBut (7,2) is 2, so if (7,2) is a bomb, then (7,1) would have two bombs: (8,0) and (7,2). But (7,2) is a number, not a flag, so it can't be a bomb. Wait, no, (7,2) is 2, which is a number, so it indicates the count, not a bomb.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- (7,1) is 2: needs two bombs in adjacent squares.\n\n- If I place a flag at (8,0), that's one bomb.\n\n- Then, (7,1) needs another bomb in its adjacent squares, which could be (8,2), (7,2), or (6,1), etc.\n\nBut (7,2) is 2, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So placing a flag at (8,0) would satisfy (8,1) and (9,1), but (7,1) would still need another bomb, perhaps at (8,2).\n\nAlternatively, placing a flag at (8,2) would satisfy (8,1) and (9,1), and also count towards (7,1)'s requirement. Then (7,1) would have one bomb at (8,2), but it needs two, so another bomb must be adjacent.\n\nSo perhaps placing flags at (8,0) and (8,2) would satisfy both (8,1) and (9,1), and also give (7,1) two bombs. But I only have three flags left, so I need to be careful.\n\nWait, but I can only place one flag at a time. So maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers that can be satisfied by placing a flag.\n\nLooking at (8,2), which is adjacent to (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), (9,1), and (9,2). If I place a flag at (8,2), it would satisfy (8,1) and (9,1), each needing one bomb. It would also count towards (7,1)'s requirement of two bombs. But (7,1) would then need another bomb adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, placing a flag at (7,2) would satisfy (7,1)'s requirement, but (7,2) is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, no, (7,2) is 2, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So placing a flag at (8,2) would help (7,1) by providing one bomb, but (7,1) would still need another.\n\nSo perhaps placing a flag at (6,1). Let's see:\n\n(6,1) is adjacent to (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2). (5,0) is a flag, so placing a flag at (6,1) would give (7,1) two bombs: (5,0) and (6,1). But (5,0) is already a flag, so that's possible. But I don't know if (6,1) is a bomb or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps placing a flag at (9,0). Let's see:\n\n(9,0) is adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (9,1). Placing a flag at (9,0) would satisfy (8,1) and (9,1). It would also count towards (7,1)'s requirement if (9,0) is adjacent, but (7,1) is not adjacent to (9,0). So that wouldn't help.\n\nAlternatively, placing a flag at (7,0). Then (7,1) would have one bomb, but it needs two. So another bomb must be adjacent.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a number that can only be satisfied by placing a flag there.\n\nLooking at (5,6) which is 1. It's adjacent to (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (6,6) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So (5,6) is 1, which is satisfied.\n\nLooking at (5,5) which is 1. It's adjacent to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (6,6) is a flag, so that's one bomb, which satisfies (5,5)'s 1.\n\nLooking at (4,6) which is 1. It's adjacent to (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). (5,6) is 1, which is a number, so that's okay.\n\nLooking at (3,5) which is 1. It's adjacent to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4) is 1, which is a number, so that's okay.\n\nLooking at (2,5) which is 1. It's adjacent to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). (2,4) is 1, which is a number, so that's okay.\n\nLooking at (1,5) which is 1. It's adjacent to (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). (2,4) is 1, which is a number, so that's okay.\n\nLooking at (0,5) which is unexplored. It's adjacent to (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,8) is 1, which is adjacent to (0,9) which is a flag.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Let me try a different approach. Since I have 3 flags left, and I need to place them correctly, perhaps I should look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers that can be satisfied by a single flag.\n\nLooking at (8,1) which is 1. If I place a flag at (8,2), that would satisfy (8,1)'s requirement and also count towards (7,1)'s requirement of two bombs. Then, (7,1) would still need another bomb, perhaps at (8,0) or (7,0).\n\nBut I can only place one flag at a time. So maybe placing a flag at (8,2) is a good move because it helps two numbers: (8,1) and (7,1). Let me check:\n\n- Placing a flag at (8,2) would mean (8,1) is satisfied because it's adjacent to a bomb.\n\n- (7,1) would have one bomb at (8,2), so it still needs another bomb adjacent.\n\nBut where would that other bomb be? It could be at (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), etc.\n\nAlternatively, placing a flag at (7,0) would satisfy (8,1) and (9,1), and also count towards (7,1)'s requirement.\n\nWait, (7,0) is adjacent to (6,0), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1). Placing a flag at (7,0) would satisfy (8,1) and (9,1), and also give (7,1) one bomb, needing another.\n\nBut I'm not sure if (7,0) is a bomb. Let me see if any numbers indicate that.\n\nLooking at (6,0), which is unexplored. It's adjacent to (5,0) which is a flag, so (6,0) can't be a bomb because (5,0) is a flag, and (6,0) is adjacent to it. Wait, no, (5,0) is a flag, which is a bomb, so (6,0) could be safe or another bomb, but (6,0) is adjacent to (5,0), which is a bomb, so (6,0) can't be a bomb because that would make (5,0)'s adjacent squares have more than one bomb if (6,0) is also a bomb, but (5,0) is a flag, so it's a bomb, and (6,0) is adjacent to it. So (6,0) can't be a bomb because that would make (5,0)'s adjacent squares have more than one bomb, but (5,0) is a flag, which is correct.\n\nWait, no, (5,0) is a flag, which is a bomb. So (6,0) is adjacent to a bomb at (5,0). So (6,0) can't be a bomb because that would mean (5,0) has two bombs adjacent, which is okay because (5,0) is a flag, but (6,0) is unexplored. Wait, no, (5,0) is a flag, which is a bomb, so (6,0) is adjacent to a bomb, but (6,0) could still be a bomb or not. Wait, no, (6,0) is adjacent to a bomb at (5,0), so (6,0) can't be a bomb because that would mean (5,0) is adjacent to two bombs, which is allowed because (5,0) is a flag. So (6,0) could be a bomb or not.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a number that can only be satisfied by placing a flag there.\n\nLooking at (3,1) which is 2. It's adjacent to (2,0) and (4,1), both flags, so that's correct.\n\nLooking at (3,3) which is 2. It's adjacent to (3,2) and (2,3), both flags, correct.\n\nLooking at (4,7) which is 2. It's adjacent to (5,6) which is 1, so that's okay.\n\nLooking at (5,6) which is 1. It's adjacent to (6,6) which is a flag, correct.\n\nLooking at (6,5) which is 1. It's adjacent to (5,5) which is 1, and (6,6) which is a flag, correct.\n\nLooking at (7,5) which is 1. It's adjacent to (6,5) which is 1, and (6,6) which is a flag, correct.\n\nLooking at (7,6) which is 1. It's adjacent to (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). (6,6) is a flag, so that's one bomb, correct.\n\nLooking at (8,5) which is unexplored. It's adjacent to (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). (7,5) is 1, which is satisfied by (6,6). So (8,5) could be a bomb, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (9,5) which is unexplored. It's adjacent to (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6). If I place a flag here, it would satisfy any adjacent numbers, but I don't see any numbers adjacent to it.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (9,6). It's adjacent to (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7). (8,6) is unexplored, (8,7) is unexplored, etc.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a number that can only be satisfied by placing a flag there.\n\nLooking at (9,1) which is 1. It's adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). If I can place a flag in one of these squares, it would satisfy (9,1)'s requirement.\n\nSimilarly, (8,1) is 1, so placing a flag in one of its adjacent squares would satisfy both (8,1) and (9,1).\n\nLooking at (8,2), which is adjacent to both (8,1) and (9,1). Placing a flag at (8,2) would satisfy both.\n\nBut I also need to check if (7,1) is 2, which would require two bombs adjacent. If I place a flag at (8,2), that's one bomb for (7,1). Then, (7,1) needs another bomb adjacent. So maybe placing a flag at (7,0) as well.\n\nBut I can only place one flag at a time. So perhaps placing a flag at (8,2) is a good move because it helps both (8,1) and (9,1), and also counts towards (7,1)'s requirement.\n\nSo I think I'll place a flag at (8,2).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (8,2) satisfies the requirements of both (8,1) and (9,1), each needing exactly one adjacent bomb. Additionally, it contributes to satisfying (7,1)'s requirement of two adjacent bombs, with the second bomb potentially located elsewhere.\n\nMOVE: 8,2,true", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 2, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the game info provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 2 flags remaining, which means I can place two more flags if needed.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each step of the analysis as outlined.\n\n1. **Check all revealed numbers against existing flags:** I need to look at each number on the board and see if the flags around them make sense. For example, if a cell has a '1' and there's already a flag adjacent to it, there shouldn't be any other bombs around it.\n\nLooking at the board, let's see:\n\n- At position (0,8), there's a '1'. The adjacent cells are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), and (1,8). (0,9) is a flag, so that accounts for the '1'. So, the other adjacent cells shouldn't have any bombs. But wait, (0,7) is a '.' which is unexplored, and (1,7) is a '.', (1,8) is a '1'. So, that seems okay because the '1' at (0,8) is already accounted for by the flag at (0,9). So no conflict there.\n\n- At position (1,0), it's a '1'. The adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (0,0) is '_', (0,1) is '_', (1,1) is '1', (2,0) is 'F', (2,1) is '.'. So the '1' at (1,0) is adjacent to a flag at (2,0). That means the other adjacent cells shouldn't have any bombs. So, (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) should be safe. But (1,1) is a '1', which is okay because it's a number, not a bomb.\n\nWait, but (1,1) is a '1', which means it has one adjacent bomb. Since (1,0) is a '1' and has a flag at (2,0), the '1' at (1,1) must have another bomb adjacent to it. Let's check the adjacent cells of (1,1): (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). We already have a flag at (2,0). So, the '1' at (1,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0) is already a flag, that accounts for the '1' at (1,1). Therefore, no conflict here.\n\nMoving on to (2,3): it's an 'F', so it's a flag. The adjacent cells should have exactly as many bombs as the numbers indicate. For example, (2,4) is a '1', so it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,3) is a flag, that counts as one bomb for (2,4). So, the other adjacent cells to (2,4) shouldn't have any bombs. Let's check: (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4). (2,3) is a flag, so that's one bomb. (1,3) is a '2', which means it has two bombs adjacent. So, (1,3) must have another bomb somewhere else besides (2,3). Let's look at (1,3)'s adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (0,3) is '_', (0,4) is '_', (1,2) is '_', (1,4) is '_', (2,2) is 'F', (2,3) is 'F', (2,4) is '1'. So, (1,3) has two flags adjacent: (2,2) and (2,3). But (1,3) is a '2', so that's correct. So, no conflict here.\n\nLooking at (3,2): it's a '2'. The adjacent cells include (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,2) is 'F', (2,3) is 'F', so that's two flags. But (3,2) is a '2', so that's exactly two bombs. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but (2,2) and (2,3) are both flags, which are bombs. So (3,2) is correctly showing '2' because there are two bombs adjacent. So no conflict.\n\nLooking at (4,2): it's a '1'. The adjacent cells include (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). (3,2) is '2', which is a number, not a bomb. So, where is the bomb? Let's see. (4,2) is '1', so there should be exactly one bomb adjacent. The only possible is (3,1) is '2', which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (5,1) is '1', also a number. (4,1) is '_', (4,3) is '_', (5,2) is '1', (5,3) is '1'. So, none of these are bombs except possibly (3,3) which is '2'. Wait, no, (3,3) is '2', a number. So, perhaps the bomb is at (5,2) or (5,3), but those are numbers. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, (4,2) is '1', so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. But looking around, I don't see any flags or bombs adjacent. So, maybe the bomb is somewhere else. Wait, perhaps (3,1) is '2', so it has two bombs adjacent. Let's check (3,1)'s adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) is 'F', (2,2) is 'F', so that's two bombs. So, (3,1) is correctly '2'. Therefore, (4,2) must have exactly one bomb adjacent, but I don't see any flags or bombs around it except possibly (3,3), which is '2', not a bomb. Wait, maybe (5,2) is a '1' because it's adjacent to a bomb. Let me check (5,2)'s adjacent cells: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (4,2) is '1', (5,1) is '1', (5,3) is '1', (6,2) is '.', (6,3) is 'F'. So, (5,2) is '1' because it's adjacent to (6,3) which is a flag. So, that's correct. Therefore, (4,2) must have exactly one bomb adjacent, which is (6,3). Wait, but (6,3) is at (6,3), which is two rows below. So, (4,2) is at (4,2), and (6,3) is at (6,3). They are not adjacent. So, that can't be. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe there's a bomb at (5,2) or (5,3), but those are numbers. Wait, no, the numbers are not bombs; they indicate the count. So, perhaps the bomb is at (5,1), but that's a '1'. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should move on and come back to this.\n\n2. **Look for obvious conflicts:** For example, a '1' with two adjacent flags. Let's see if any number has more flags around it than its value.\n\nLooking at (0,8) which is '1' and has one flag at (0,9). That's fine. (1,0) is '1' with a flag at (2,0). That's okay. (2,4) is '1' with a flag at (2,3). That's okay. (3,2) is '2' with two flags at (2,2) and (2,3). That's correct. (4,2) is '1' but I can't see any flags around it, so that's okay. (5,2) is '1' with a flag at (6,3). Wait, (5,2) is at (5,2), and (6,3) is at (6,3). Are they adjacent? (5,2) and (6,3) are diagonally adjacent, yes. So, (5,2) is '1' because it's adjacent to (6,3) which is a flag. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought (4,2) is '1' and needs to have one bomb adjacent, but I couldn't find any. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. (4,2) is '1', so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Let's list all adjacent cells:\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (3,1) is '2' (number)\n- (3,2) is '2' (number)\n- (3,3) is '2' (number)\n- (4,1) is '_' (revealed but empty)\n- (4,3) is '_' (revealed but empty)\n- (5,1) is '1' (number)\n- (5,2) is '1' (number)\n- (5,3) is '1' (number)\n\nSo, none of these are bombs or flags. So, where is the bomb? That's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, (5,3) is a '1', which is adjacent to (6,3) which is a flag. So, (5,3) is correctly '1' because of the flag at (6,3). Similarly, (5,2) is '1' because of (6,3). But (4,2) is '1' and should have a bomb adjacent, but I don't see any. So, perhaps I'm missing a flag somewhere. Or maybe the bomb is at (5,1), but (5,1) is a '1', not a bomb. Hmm, maybe I should consider that (4,2) is a '1' and needs a bomb adjacent, but I can't see any. So, perhaps I should look for possible places to place a flag that would satisfy this.\n\n3. **Consider remaining flags vs bombs:** There are 10 bombs in total. I have 2 flags left. Let me count the number of flags already on the board.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (0,9) is 'F'\n- (2,0) is 'F'\n- (2,2) is 'F'\n- (2,3) is 'F'\n- (6,3) is 'F'\n\nWait, that's five flags, but the game info says flags remaining: 2. So, total bombs are 10, and flags placed so far are 5, so I can place 5 more? Wait, no. Wait, the game info says flags remaining: 2, meaning I can place 2 more flags. So, total flags placed so far must be 8, because 10 bombs - 2 remaining = 8 placed. Let me recount the flags on the board:\n\nLooking row by row:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) is F \u2192 1\nRow 1: no F\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,3) \u2192 3\nRow 3: no F\nRow 4: no F\nRow 5: no F\nRow 6: (6,3) is F \u2192 1\nRow 7: no F\nRow 8: (8,2) is F \u2192 1\nRow 9: no F\n\nWait, that's 1+3+1+1=6 flags. So, 6 flags placed, 4 remaining? Wait, but the game info says flags remaining: 2. So, that suggests that I can place 2 more flags. So, total flags placed so far are 8? Wait, I'm confused. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) \u2192 1\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,3) \u2192 3\nRow 6: (6,3) \u2192 1\nRow 8: (8,2) \u2192 1\nThat's 1+3+1+1=6. So, if total bombs are 10, and I've placed 6 flags, I have 4 left to place. But the game info says flags remaining: 2. Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the game info says flags remaining: 2, which probably means that I can place 2 more flags. So, the total flags placed so far must be 8 (since 10-2=8). But when I count on the board, I see 6 flags. So, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) \u2192 1\nRow 1: no F\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,3) \u2192 3\nRow 3: no F\nRow 4: no F\nRow 5: no F\nRow 6: (6,3) \u2192 1\nRow 7: no F\nRow 8: (8,2) \u2192 1\nRow 9: no F\nTotal: 1+3+1+1=6. So, that's 6 flags. Therefore, I have 4 flags remaining, but the game info says 2. Hmm, maybe the game info is incorrect, or perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps some flags are not correctly placed, and I need to remove some. Maybe some flags are incorrectly placed, causing the discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the flags are incorrectly placed, and I should remove them. Let's check each flag to see if they make sense.\n\nStarting with (0,9): it's a flag. The adjacent cell (0,8) is '1', which is correct because the flag at (0,9) accounts for the '1'. So, that's okay.\n\n(2,0): it's a flag. The adjacent cell (1,0) is '1', which is correct because (2,0) is the only flag adjacent to (1,0). So, that's okay.\n\n(2,2): flag. The adjacent cells include (1,1), which is '1', and (1,2), which is '_', and (2,1), which is '.', etc. Wait, (1,1) is '1', which is adjacent to (2,0) and (2,2). So, (1,1) is '1' and has two flags adjacent, which would mean it's conflicting because a '1' can only have one bomb adjacent. Wait, that's a problem. (1,1) is '1' but is adjacent to two flags at (2,0) and (2,2). That's a conflict because a '1' can only have one bomb adjacent. So, this is an obvious conflict. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is a flag. The adjacent cell (2,4) is '1', which is correct because (2,3) is the only flag adjacent to (2,4). So, that's okay.\n\n(6,3) is a flag. The adjacent cell (5,3) is '1', which is correct because (6,3) is the only flag adjacent to (5,3). So, that's okay.\n\n(8,2) is a flag. The adjacent cells include (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3). Let's see if any numbers are affected. (7,2) is '2', so it should have two bombs adjacent. The flag at (8,2) is one, so there must be another bomb adjacent to (7,2). Let's check the adjacent cells of (7,2): (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (6,3) is a flag, (8,2) is a flag, so that's two bombs. So, (7,2) is correctly '2'. So, that's okay.\n\nSo, the problem is with (2,2) and (2,0) both being flags adjacent to (1,1), which is '1'. That's a conflict because (1,1) can only have one bomb adjacent, but it has two flags. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrect. So, I need to remove one of them.\n\nWhich one should I remove? Let's see. If I remove (2,0), then (1,0) is '1' and would only have one flag at (2,2), which is okay. But (2,2) is adjacent to (1,1) and (1,2), etc. Alternatively, if I remove (2,2), then (1,1) would only have one flag at (2,0), which is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps I should remove the flag at (2,2). Let me check what happens if I remove (2,2). Then, (1,1) would have only one flag at (2,0), which is correct. Also, (2,2) was a flag, but if I remove it, I can place a flag elsewhere if needed.\n\nBut wait, I have 2 flags remaining, but I just removed one, so I can place another. Alternatively, maybe I should remove (2,0) instead. Let me think.\n\nIf I remove (2,0), then (1,0) is '1' and would have no flags adjacent, which would mean there's a bomb somewhere else around it. But (1,0)'s adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). If I remove (2,0), then (1,0) is '1' and must have exactly one bomb adjacent. So, the bomb must be in one of the other cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1). But (1,1) is '1', which is a number, not a bomb. So, perhaps the bomb is at (0,0) or (0,1). But those are empty. Alternatively, maybe (2,1) is a bomb. But (2,1) is '.' which is unexplored. So, that could be possible.\n\nAlternatively, if I remove (2,2), then (1,1) is '1' with only one flag at (2,0), which is correct. Then, (2,2) becomes a revealed cell, which was previously a flag. So, I can then perhaps reveal (2,2) to see if it's a bomb or not. But if I remove the flag, I have to make a move to do that.\n\nWait, according to the rules, to remove a flag, I have to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So, I can do that.\n\nSo, perhaps my next move should be to remove the flag at (2,2) because it's causing a conflict with (1,1)'s '1'.\n\nAlternatively, I could remove (2,0), but that might cause (1,0) to have no flags, which could be correct if there's a bomb elsewhere. But I'm not sure where that bomb would be.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to remove the flag at (2,2) because it's causing a conflict with (1,1)'s '1' being adjacent to two flags.\n\nAfter removing (2,2), (1,1) would only have one flag at (2,0), which is correct. Then, (2,2) would be revealed as either a bomb or not. But since I'm only removing the flag, I don't reveal it; I just unflag it.\n\nWait, no. When you remove a flag, you just set it back to unflagged, but the cell remains as it was. So, (2,2) was flagged, and removing the flag would make it back to '.' if it was unexplored, but in this case, (2,2) is a flag, so removing it would make it '.' again, but I'm not revealing it. So, I can do that.\n\nSo, my move would be to remove the flag at (2,2), which is (2,2), flag=true. Wait, no: to remove a flag, I have to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So, the move would be x=2, y=2, flag=true. But wait, that would place a flag, not remove it. Oh, wait, no. To remove a flag, you have to make a move with flag=true on a flagged square. So, if you make a move with flag=true on a square that's already flagged, it removes the flag.\n\nSo, the move would be (2,2, true). That would remove the flag at (2,2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to set flag=false, but I think the rules say that to remove a flag, you make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\n\nSo, the move would be (2,2, true). That would remove the flag, resolving the conflict.\n\nAfter that, (1,1) would have only one flag adjacent, which is correct.\n\nThen, I can proceed to place other flags where appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, I could also consider placing a flag at (4,2) because it's a '1' and needs exactly one bomb adjacent, but I can't see any around it. So, perhaps placing a flag there would help, but I need to make sure it doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nWait, but (4,2) is '1', so if I place a flag there, I have to ensure that it doesn't cause any other numbers to have too many flags adjacent. For example, (3,2) is '2' and is adjacent to (4,2). If I place a flag at (4,2), then (3,2) would have one flag adjacent, so it would need another bomb somewhere else. Let's check (3,2)'s adjacent cells: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,2) is a flag, (2,3) is a flag, so that's two flags. So, (3,2) is '2', which is correct. So, placing a flag at (4,2) would not affect (3,2) because it's already accounting for two flags. Wait, no, because if I place a flag at (4,2), then (3,2) would have three flags adjacent: (2,2), (2,3), and (4,2). But (3,2) is '2', which can only have two bombs adjacent. So, that would be a conflict. Therefore, I cannot place a flag at (4,2) because it would cause (3,2) to have three flags adjacent, which is more than its value of '2'.\n\nSo, placing a flag at (4,2) is not possible without causing a conflict. Therefore, I should not do that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (4,2) to see if it's a bomb or not, but since it's a '1', revealing it would show either a bomb or a '1' with adjacent bombs. But since I can't see any bombs around it, perhaps it's safe. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but (4,2) is '1', so if I reveal it, it should be safe because it's a number. Revealing it would show the number '1' and possibly reveal surrounding cells. But I have to decide whether to reveal or flag.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for other cells that can be revealed safely.\n\nLooking at the board, let's see if any cells can be safely revealed without hitting a bomb.\n\nFor example, (0,0) is '_', which is a revealed empty space. So, it's safe. But it's already revealed.\n\nLooking at (0,1), it's '_', so it's revealed but empty.\n\n(0,2) is '_', same.\n\n(0,3) is '_', same.\n\n(0,4) is '_', same.\n\n(0,5) is '_', same.\n\n(0,6) is '_', same.\n\n(0,7) is '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, perhaps revealing (0,7) would help. Let's see what's around it.\n\n(0,7) is adjacent to (0,6), (0,8), (0,9), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,8) is '1', (0,9) is 'F', (1,7) is '.', (1,8) is '1'. So, if I reveal (0,7), it could be a number or a bomb. But since (0,8) is '1' and has a flag at (0,9), (0,7) is adjacent to (0,8) which is '1', so (0,7) could be '1' or higher. But without knowing, it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for cells that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which can help narrow down the possibilities.\n\nLooking at (5,5): it's '.', unexplored. The adjacent cells include (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (5,4) is '1', (5,6) is '1', (6,5) is '1', (6,6) is '.'. So, revealing (5,5) might give a number that could help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (7,7) is a good spot, but it's '.' and surrounded by other '.'.\n\nWait, perhaps (9,9) is a corner, but it's '.'.\n\nAlternatively, looking back to (4,2), which is '1' but seems to have no adjacent flags or bombs. So, perhaps I should reveal it to see if it's a bomb or not. But since it's a '1', it's safe to reveal, and it should show a '1' with one adjacent bomb. But I can't see where that bomb would be, so maybe revealing it would help clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should focus on the conflict I found earlier and remove the flag at (2,2). That seems like a priority because it's causing a conflict with (1,1)'s '1'.\n\nSo, my next move would be to remove the flag at (2,2), which is (2,2), flag=true. Wait, no, to remove a flag, I have to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So, the move would be (2,2, true). That would remove the flag at (2,2).\n\nAfter doing that, (1,1) would have only one flag adjacent at (2,0), which is correct. Then, I can reassess the board.\n\nSo, the explanation would be that removing the flag at (2,2) resolves the conflict with (1,1)'s '1' having two adjacent flags. Then, I can proceed to place flags elsewhere if needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that (2,2) is a bomb, and thus shouldn't be removed. But given that (1,1) is '1' and has two flags adjacent, that's a conflict that needs to be resolved, so removing one of the flags is necessary.\n\nTherefore, my next move is to remove the flag at (2,2).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Removing the flag at (2,2) resolves the conflict where (1,1)'s '1' was adjacent to two flags, which is impossible. This correction allows the board state to comply with the rules.\n\nMOVE: 2,2,true", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 F .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 3, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board state and the game info provided.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The flags remaining are 3, which means I can place up to 3 more flags. So, I have to be careful where I place them because I don't want to waste them or place them incorrectly, which could cause me to lose the game if I reveal a bomb by mistake.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares are already revealed with numbers, some are flagged (marked as 'F'), and others are still unexplored (marked as '.'). My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. Since I have flags remaining, I should consider whether placing a flag is a good move or if I should reveal a square to get more information.\n\nI need to check all the revealed numbers against the existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. For example, if a square shows '1' and has two adjacent flags, that's a conflict because the number indicates exactly one bomb adjacent. Similarly, if a '2' has only one flag nearby, there must be another bomb adjacent, so I should look for that.\n\nLet me go through the board row by row to spot any obvious issues or opportunities.\n\nStarting with row 0: The revealed squares are at (0,8) with a '1' and (0,9) as unexplored. The '1' at (0,8) means there's exactly one bomb in the adjacent squares. The adjacent squares would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). I see that (0,7) is a '1', so that's another clue. Wait, no, (0,7) is actually a '1' as well, so that might indicate something about the surrounding area.\n\nRow 1 has several revealed squares: (1,0) is '1', (1,1) is '1', (1,2) is '2', (1,3) is '1', (1,4) is '1', (1,8) is '1', and (1,9) is unexplored. There's a flag at (1,9). Hmm, but wait, the game info says flags remaining are 3, so there must be some flags already placed. Let me check the board again. Oh, I see flags at (0,9) is 'F', (2,0) is 'F', and (4,1) is 'F', so three flags are already placed. Wait, but the game info says flags remaining are 3, so that would mean I can place up to 3 more. Wait, no, maybe the flags remaining is the number left to place, so if there are 10 bombs and I've already placed 3 flags, I have 7 left to place. Wait, no, the game info says \"Flags remaining: 3\", which probably means I can place 3 more flags because the total is 10 bombs, so 10 flags in total, but I've already placed some. Wait, no, in Minesweeper, the number of flags you can place is equal to the number of bombs, which is 10 here. So if the flags remaining are 3, that means I've already placed 7 flags, and can place 3 more. But looking at the board, I count three 'F's: at (0,9), (2,0), and (4,1). So maybe the flags remaining are 3, meaning I can place 3 more. That makes sense.\n\nSo, I need to be cautious with placing flags because I can only place 3 more. I should only place them where I'm certain there's a bomb, based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 2: (2,0) is 'F', (2,3) is 'F', (2,8) is '1', and (2,9) is '2'. So, the '2' at (2,9) indicates two bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent squares would be (1,8), (1,9), (2,8), and (3,8), (3,9). Since (2,8) is '1', that might help. Let me see: (2,9) is '2', so it needs two bombs around it. If (2,8) is '1', that means only one bomb is adjacent to (2,8). So, perhaps one of the bombs is at (1,9), which is flagged, so that's one. Then, (2,9) needs another bomb. The possible squares are (3,9) or (3,8), or maybe (1,8). Wait, (1,8) is '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (1,8) is '1', and it's adjacent to (1,7), which is unexplored, (1,9), which is flagged, and (0,8), which is '1', and (0,7), which is '1', and (2,8), which is '1'. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look for areas where the numbers give me more certain information. Let's check row 7: (7,1) is '1', (7,2) is '2', (7,3) is '2', (7,4) is '1', (7,5) is '1', (7,6) is '1', and (7,7) is '.'.\n\nWait, (7,2) is '2', which means two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (7,1) is '1', so that could help. If (7,1) is '1', then it can only have one bomb adjacent. Let's see: (7,1) is adjacent to (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). But (6,0) is unexplored, (6,1) is unexplored, (6,2) is unexplored, (7,0) is unexplored, (7,2) is '2', (8,0) is unexplored, (8,1) is '1', (8,2) is 'F'. So, (7,1) is '1', so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (8,2) is flagged, that's one bomb. Therefore, (7,1) cannot have any other bombs adjacent. So, in the adjacent squares of (7,1), the only bomb is at (8,2). Therefore, the other squares adjacent to (7,1) cannot have bombs. So, that means (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1) cannot have bombs except (8,2). \n\nBut wait, (7,2) is '2', which requires two bombs adjacent. Since (8,2) is one, there must be another. So, the other bomb must be in one of the other adjacent squares. Let me list the adjacent squares of (7,2): (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). We know (8,2) is a flag, so that's one. So, another bomb must be in one of the other squares. But (7,1) is '1', and we just determined that (7,1) can't have any other bombs adjacent except (8,2). Therefore, the other bomb adjacent to (7,2) must be in (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,3), (8,1), or (8,3).\n\nWait, (7,3) is '2' as well. So, (7,3) is '2', which means two bombs adjacent to it. Let's see its adjacent squares: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). We know (8,2) is a flag, so that's one. Therefore, (7,3) needs another bomb. The possible squares are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,3), (8,4). But (7,2) is '2', which we already know has to have another bomb. So, perhaps one of the bombs is shared between (7,2) and (7,3). For example, if (6,2) is a bomb, that would satisfy both (7,2) and (7,3). Let me check if that's possible.\n\nIf (6,2) is a bomb, then (7,2) would have two bombs: (8,2) and (6,2), which would satisfy the '2'. Similarly, (7,3) would have (8,2) and (6,3), but wait, (6,3) is unexplored. Alternatively, if (6,2) is a bomb, then (7,3) could have another bomb at (6,3). But I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for other clues. Let's check row 5: (5,0) is unexplored, (5,1) is '1', (5,2) is '1', (5,3) is '1', (5,4) is '.', (5,5) is '1', (5,6) is '1', (5,7) is '1', (5,8) is '2', (5,9) is '.'.\n\nLooking at (5,8) is '2', so two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). (4,8) is '1', (5,7) is '1', (6,7) is '.', (6,8) is 'F', (6,9) is '.'. So, (5,8) is '2', so two bombs. (6,8) is a flag, so that's one. So, another bomb must be adjacent. Let's see: (4,7) is unexplored, (4,8) is '1', (4,9) is '2', (5,7) is '1', (5,9) is '.', (6,7) is '.', (6,9) is '.'.\n\nWait, (4,8) is '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (4,8) are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (3,7) is unexplored, (3,8) is '1', (3,9) is '.', (4,7) is unexplored, (4,9) is '2', (5,7) is '1', (5,8) is '2', (5,9) is '.'.\n\nSo, (4,8) is '1', meaning only one bomb adjacent. If (6,8) is a flag, then that's one bomb. Therefore, none of the other adjacent squares to (4,8) can have bombs. So, (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) cannot have bombs except (6,8). Wait, but (4,9) is '2', which is adjacent to (4,8). So, (4,9) is '2', meaning two bombs adjacent. But (4,8) is '1', so only one bomb is adjacent to it, which is (6,8). Therefore, (4,9) must have two bombs adjacent, but since (4,8) is '1', the other bomb must be elsewhere. So, the bombs adjacent to (4,9) must be (5,9) and maybe (3,9) or (5,8). But (5,8) is '2', which already has (6,8) as one bomb, so it needs another. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square where the number indicates that all adjacent squares must be bombs except one, or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a square that is definitely a bomb because the numbers around it require it.\n\nLooking back at row 2, (2,9) is '2', which needs two bombs. One is at (1,9), which is flagged. So, the other must be at (3,9) or (3,8). Let's check (3,8): it's '1', so only one bomb adjacent. So, if (2,9) needs another bomb, it could be at (3,9). Let me see what's around (3,9). (3,9) is adjacent to (2,8), (2,9), (3,8), (4,8), (4,9). (2,8) is '1', (2,9) is '2', (3,8) is '1', (4,8) is '1', (4,9) is '2'. So, if (3,9) is a bomb, that would satisfy (2,9)'s '2' because it would have (1,9) and (3,9) as bombs. Also, (3,8) is '1', which would have (3,9) as the only bomb adjacent. That makes sense because (3,8) is '1', so only one bomb adjacent, which would be (3,9). Similarly, (4,8) is '1', so it would have (3,9) as the bomb? Wait, no, (4,8) is adjacent to (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,8). If (3,9) is a bomb, then (4,8) would have that as a bomb, but (4,8) is '1', so that's okay. But (4,9) is '2', which would have (3,9) as one bomb and needs another. So, (4,9) would need another bomb adjacent, perhaps at (5,9) or (5,8). \n\nThis is getting a bit too speculative. Maybe I should look for a square that's surrounded by numbers that can only be satisfied by placing a flag there.\n\nWait, looking at (8,1): it's '1'. So, only one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (8,2) is 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, none of the other adjacent squares can have bombs. So, (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2) cannot have bombs. That's useful information because it rules out bombs in those areas.\n\nSimilarly, (7,1) is '1', and we've already determined that (8,2) is the only bomb adjacent to it. So, that helps.\n\nLooking at (5,8): it's '2', and (6,8) is 'F', so one bomb is there. The other must be somewhere else. Let's see the adjacent squares: (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9). (4,8) is '1', so only one bomb adjacent, which is (6,8). Therefore, (5,8) needs another bomb. So, the other bomb must be in (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), or (6,9). \n\nBut (5,7) is '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. Let's see, (5,7) is adjacent to (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (6,8) is a flag, so that's one bomb. Therefore, (5,7) can't have any other bombs adjacent. So, the other bomb for (5,8) can't be at (5,7). So, it must be at (4,7), (4,9), (5,9), (6,7), or (6,9).\n\nBut (4,9) is '2', which needs two bombs. Its adjacent squares are (3,8), (3,9), (4,8), (4,10) which is out of bounds, (5,8), (5,9), (5,10) which is out, (6,8), (6,9). So, (4,9) is '2', needing two bombs. It's adjacent to (6,8) which is a flag, so that's one. The other must be at (3,9), (5,9), or (6,9). \n\nIf I can find a square that must be a bomb based on the numbers, that would be a good place to flag. Alternatively, if I can find a square that is definitely safe, I can reveal it to get more information.\n\nLooking at (9,0): it's unexplored, and adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (9,1). (8,1) is '1', and (8,1) is adjacent to (8,2) which is a flag, so (9,0) can't be a bomb because (8,1) is '1' and already has the flag at (8,2). Therefore, (9,0) is safe. So, I can reveal (9,0) to get more information. That might help me figure out more about the surrounding squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, which can help narrow down the possibilities.\n\nWait, (3,3) is 'F', so that's a flagged square. Let me check around it. (3,3) is adjacent to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,3) is 'F', so that's another flag. So, (3,3) is a flag, and (2,3) is also a flag. Let me see if that causes any conflicts with the numbers.\n\nLooking at (2,2): it's '2', so two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1) is '1', (1,2) is '1', (1,3) is 'F', (2,1) is '1', (2,3) is 'F', (3,1) is '1', (3,2) is '.', (3,3) is 'F'. So, (2,2) is '2', meaning two bombs. The flags are at (1,3) and (2,3) and (3,3). So, that's three flags, but (2,2) is '2', so it can only have two bombs adjacent. Therefore, this is a conflict because (2,2) is '2' but has three flags adjacent. That's a problem because the number should match exactly. So, this indicates that either one of the flags is incorrect, or there's a mistake in the board state.\n\nWait, that can't be right. The board state shows (2,3) as 'F' and (3,3) as 'F', so that's two flags adjacent to (2,2). Also, (1,3) is 'F', so that's three flags. But (2,2) is '2', which requires exactly two bombs. Therefore, this is a conflict. That suggests that one of these flags is incorrectly placed because a '2' can't have three bombs adjacent.\n\nSo, this is a critical issue. I need to resolve this conflict. According to the critical flag placement rules, I should consider removing a flag if it causes a conflict with the numbers.\n\nSo, the possible solutions are:\n\n1. Remove one of the flags adjacent to (2,2) so that only two remain.\n\n2. Reveal a square that would show a bomb, but that's risky.\n\nSince I have flags remaining, but I can also remove flags, I should consider which flag is incorrectly placed.\n\nLooking at the flags around (2,2): (1,3), (2,3), and (3,3). Let me check each of these.\n\nFirst, (1,3): it's in row 1, column 3. Let's see what numbers are around it. (1,3) is adjacent to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (0,3) is '1', (0,4) is '.', (1,2) is '1', (1,4) is '1', (2,2) is '2', (2,4) is '1', etc. If (1,3) is a flag, then it's a bomb. But (2,2) is '2', which would require another bomb adjacent. If (1,3) is a bomb, then (2,2) has (1,3) and (2,3) as bombs, which would make two bombs, satisfying the '2'. But (3,3) is also a flag, which would add a third bomb adjacent to (2,2), which is a problem. Therefore, (3,3) cannot be a bomb if (2,2) is '2' and (1,3) and (2,3) are already bombs.\n\nSo, perhaps (3,3) is incorrectly flagged. Therefore, I should remove the flag at (3,3) because it's causing a conflict with (2,2)'s '2'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (2,3) is incorrectly flagged, but let's check that.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (3,3), then (2,2) would have two bombs: (1,3) and (2,3), which satisfies the '2'. That would resolve the conflict. So, I should make a move to remove the flag at (3,3).\n\nSo, the move would be to go to (3,3) and remove the flag, which is done by setting flag=true on an already flagged square.\n\nTherefore, my next move would be to remove the flag at (3,3), as it's causing a conflict with the '2' at (2,2).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The flag at (3,3) causes a conflict with the '2' at (2,2), which can only have two adjacent bombs.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 3, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 10x10, with 10 bombs in total. There are flags remaining: 2. So, I can place two more flags if needed.\n\nLooking at the board, I see some revealed numbers and some flags. I should check if any of the revealed numbers conflict with the existing flags. For example, if a '1' has two flags around it, that's a problem because a '1' can only have one adjacent bomb.\n\nLet me go through each revealed number and see if their adjacent flags make sense.\n\nStarting from the top-left (0,0), it's empty. (0,8) is a '1', which means there's exactly one bomb in the surrounding 8 squares. Let me check the squares around (0,8). The adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). Wait, (0,9) is a flag, so that must be the bomb that the '1' is indicating. So, the '1' at (0,8) is satisfied because it has one flag adjacent. So no conflict there.\n\nMoving to row 1, column 0 is '1', which is also a '1'. The adjacent squares would include (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). There are no flags around this '1' yet, so that's fine. It just means there's one bomb somewhere around it.\n\nNext, in row 1, column 3 is '2'. So, around this square, there should be exactly two bombs. Looking at the adjacent squares: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). I don't see any flags here, so that's okay for now.\n\nIn row 2, column 0 is 'F', which is a flag. Then, row 2, column 3 is 'F' again. So, two flags in row 2. I should check if these flags are conflicting with any numbers.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 0: the adjacent squares are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). The '1' at (1,0) is adjacent to this flag, which is fine because the '1' can have one bomb. But wait, if there's another flag adjacent to (1,0), that would be a problem. Let me check if (1,0) has any other flags nearby. The only flag near it is (2,0). So that's okay.\n\nSimilarly, the flag at (2,3) is adjacent to (1,3) which is '2'. So, if (2,3) is a flag, that counts as one bomb towards the '2' at (1,3). But the '2' needs exactly two bombs, so there must be another bomb adjacent to (1,3). Let me check the surrounding squares of (1,3). The squares around (1,3) are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). We have a flag at (2,3), so that's one bomb. Are there any other flags nearby? I don't see any, so that means there must be another bomb somewhere around (1,3). But I can't tell where exactly yet.\n\nLooking further down, row 3, column 1 is '2'. The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). There's a flag at (2,0), which counts as one bomb. So the '2' at (3,1) needs another bomb nearby. Let me check if any other squares around it are flagged. I don't see any other flags, so there must be another bomb in the adjacent squares.\n\nRow 4, column 1 is 'F'. So that's another flag. Let me check the adjacent squares. (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). The '1' at (3,1) is adjacent to this flag. So the '1' at (3,1) now has one flag, which is correct. But wait, (3,1) is a '2', not a '1'. Oh, I'm getting confused. Wait, no, (3,1) is '2', so it's okay because the flag at (4,1) is one bomb, and there must be another bomb nearby.\n\nWait, no, the flag at (4,1) is adjacent to (3,1), which is a '2'. So that counts as one bomb. So the '2' at (3,1) needs another bomb somewhere else. Let me check the other adjacent squares. (2,0) is a flag, which is another bomb. Wait, (2,0) is a flag, which is adjacent to (3,1). So that's two bombs: (2,0) and (4,1). But (3,1) is a '2', so that's perfect. So no conflict there.\n\nMoving on, row 5, column 1 is '1'. The adjacent squares include (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). The flag at (4,1) is adjacent to this '1', so that's one bomb. The '1' can only have one bomb, so there shouldn't be any other bombs adjacent. So the other adjacent squares should be safe. Let me check if any other squares around (5,1) are flagged. I don't see any, so that's okay.\n\nRow 5, column 4 is '1'. Adjacent squares are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). There's a flag at (5,3) which is adjacent. So that's one bomb, which is correct. No other flags nearby, so that's fine.\n\nRow 6, column 2 is 'F'. Let's see the adjacent squares: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). The '1' at (5,1) is adjacent, which counts as one bomb. The '1' at (5,3) is also adjacent, which counts as another bomb. Wait, but (5,3) is a '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. But (6,2) is a flag, which is one bomb, and if (5,3) is a '1', then it can't have another bomb adjacent. Let me check the squares around (5,3). The adjacent squares are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). The flag at (6,2) is one bomb, so that's okay. But wait, (5,3) is a '1', so it can only have one bomb. So the flag at (6,2) is the only bomb adjacent to (5,3). That's correct.\n\nWait, but (6,2) is adjacent to both (5,1) and (5,3). So the '1' at (5,1) has one bomb (6,2), and the '1' at (5,3) also has the same bomb (6,2). But each '1' must have exactly one bomb adjacent, but they share the same bomb. Is that allowed? Yes, because each '1' is counting the same bomb as their adjacent. So that's okay.\n\nNow, I should check if any of the revealed numbers have conflicting flags. For example, a '1' with two flags adjacent would be a conflict.\n\nLooking through the board, I don't see any obvious conflicts. So that's good.\n\nNext, I should consider the remaining flags. There are 2 flags remaining. Since there are 10 bombs in total, and I've already placed some flags, I need to count how many bombs are already flagged.\n\nLooking at the board, I see flags at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (4,1), (6,2). Wait, that's five flags, but the game info says flags remaining: 2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recount.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 0: . at (0,9) is a flag? Wait, the board state shows:\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n\nSo (0,9) is 'F'. Then row 2: F . . F 1 ... So (2,0) and (2,3) are flags. Row4: _ F . ... So (4,1) is a flag. Row6: ... F ... So (6,2) is a flag. So that's four flags: (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (4,1), (6,2). Wait, that's five flags, but the game info says flags remaining: 2. That means I've already used 8 flags? But the total bombs are 10, so I can have up to 10 flags. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\nRow0: ... 1 . F \u2192 (0,9) is F.\n\nRow1: 1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n\nRow2: F . . F 1 _ _ 1 2 .\n\nRow3: 1 2 F F 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow4: _ F . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n\nRow5: _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n\nRow6: _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F . .\n\nRow7: _ 1 2 2 1 1 . . . .\n\nRow8: _ 1 F . . . . . . .\n\nRow9: _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nSo let's count the Fs:\n\nRow0: (0,9) \u2192 1\n\nRow2: (2,0), (2,3) \u2192 2\n\nRow4: (4,1) \u21921\n\nRow6: (6,2) \u21921\n\nRow8: (8,2) \u21921\n\nSo total flags: 1+2+1+1+1=6. But the game info says flags remaining:2, which implies that I've placed 8 flags. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the board state is using 'F' to indicate flagged squares. Let me go row by row:\n\nRow0: columns 0-9: positions (0,0) to (0,9). Only (0,9) is F.\n\nRow1: no Fs.\n\nRow2: (2,0) and (2,3) are F.\n\nRow3: no Fs.\n\nRow4: (4,1) is F.\n\nRow5: no Fs.\n\nRow6: (6,2) is F.\n\nRow7: no Fs.\n\nRow8: (8,2) is F.\n\nRow9: no Fs.\n\nSo total flags: 1 (row0) + 2 (row2) +1 (row4) +1 (row6) +1 (row8) = 6 flags. But the game info says flags remaining:2. So that means I've already placed 8 flags, but I only see 6. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the initial count was different.\n\nWait, perhaps the game info says flags remaining:2, meaning I can place 2 more. So total flags placed so far would be 8, because 10 bombs - 2 remaining = 8 placed. But I only see 6. So maybe I'm miscounting the flags on the board.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow0: (0,9) \u2192 F.\n\nRow2: (2,0), (2,3) \u2192 2.\n\nRow4: (4,1) \u21921.\n\nRow6: (6,2) \u21921.\n\nRow8: (8,2) \u21921.\n\nThat's total of 6. So perhaps the game info is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the flags remaining is 2, so I can place 2 more, making total flags 8.\n\nAnyway, moving on.\n\nI need to decide the next move. I can either reveal a square or place a flag. Since I have flags remaining, I should consider placing flags where it's safe.\n\nLooking for obvious places to flag. Let me look for squares that are surrounded by numbers that indicate exactly where the bombs are.\n\nFor example, if a '1' is next to a flag, and the '1' is only adjacent to one unexplored square, then that square must be a bomb. So I can flag it.\n\nLooking at the board, let's check for such situations.\n\nLooking at row0, column8 is '1', and (0,9) is a flag. The adjacent squares to (0,8) are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). Since (0,9) is a flag, the '1' is satisfied, so (0,8) is safe. So no need to flag there.\n\nLooking at row1, column0 is '1'. The adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (2,0) is a flag, so the '1' is satisfied. So no need to flag elsewhere.\n\nRow2, column4 is '1'. The adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (2,3) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So the '1' is satisfied. So no need to flag elsewhere.\n\nRow3, column4 is '1'. The adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So the '1' is satisfied.\n\nRow4, column3 is '1'. The adjacent squares are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). There's a flag at (4,1), but that's not adjacent to (4,3). Wait, (4,1) is adjacent to (4,3)? No, because (4,1) is column1, and (4,3) is column3, so they are two apart. So no, they are not adjacent. So the '1' at (4,3) needs to have one bomb adjacent. Let me see if any of the adjacent squares are flagged. I don't see any, so that means there's a bomb somewhere around (4,3). But I can't tell exactly where yet.\n\nRow5, column5 is '1'. The adjacent squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). There's a flag at (6,2), but that's not adjacent. So the '1' at (5,5) needs one bomb nearby. Not sure where yet.\n\nRow5, column7 is '2'. The adjacent squares are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). There's a flag at (6,2), but that's not adjacent. So the '2' needs two bombs nearby. Not sure yet.\n\nRow6, column5 is '1'. The adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). There's a flag at (6,2), but not adjacent. So the '1' needs one bomb nearby.\n\nRow7, column1 is '1'. The adjacent squares are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). There's a flag at (8,2). So that's one bomb. So the '1' is satisfied.\n\nRow7, column3 is '2'. The adjacent squares are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). There's a flag at (6,2) and (8,2). So that's two bombs. So the '2' is satisfied.\n\nRow7, column4 is '2'. The adjacent squares are (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). There's a flag at (8,2), but that's not adjacent. So the '2' needs two bombs nearby. Not sure yet.\n\nRow8, column1 is '1'. The adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). There's a flag at (8,2). So that's one bomb. So the '1' is satisfied.\n\nRow9, column1 is '1'. The adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). There's a flag at (8,2). So that's one bomb. So the '1' is satisfied.\n\nSo, looking through all the numbers, I don't see any immediate conflicts. Now, I should look for opportunities to place flags where the numbers indicate a bomb must be there.\n\nLooking for a '1' that is adjacent to a flag and has only one unexplored square left, which must be a bomb.\n\nFor example, let's look at row3, column0: it's '1'. The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1). (2,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So the '1' is satisfied. So no need to flag elsewhere.\n\nRow4, column3 is '1'. Let's see the adjacent squares: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). None of these are flagged except (4,1), which is not adjacent. So the '1' must have one bomb in these squares. But I can't tell exactly where.\n\nWait, perhaps row5, column3 is '1'. Let me check. No, row5, column3 is '1' in the board? Wait, looking back:\n\nRow5: _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n\nSo (5,3) is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). There's a flag at (6,2). So that's one bomb. So the '1' is satisfied. So no need to flag elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row5, column7 is '2'. Adjacent squares: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). No flags here. So the '2' needs two bombs nearby. Maybe (4,7) and (5,6) are bombs? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row8, column2 is 'F', which is a flag. The adjacent squares are (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3). The '1's at (7,1) and (8,1) are satisfied by this flag.\n\nNow, I should consider placing a flag where a number indicates that a specific square must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row5, column5 is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). None of these are flagged. So the '1' must have one bomb in these squares. But I can't determine exactly where.\n\nWait, perhaps row6, column5 is '1'. Let me check. Yes, (6,5) is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). There's a flag at (6,2), but that's not adjacent. So the '1' needs one bomb nearby.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, making it a likely candidate for a bomb.\n\nFor example, looking at row7, column3 is '2'. Its adjacent squares include (6,2), which is a flag, and (7,2), (7,4), etc. So that's one bomb, needs another.\n\nBut I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should try to reveal a square that's likely safe.\n\nLooking at row0, column0 is empty. Revealing it might give me more information. But it's in the top-left corner, so maybe it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row9, column0 is empty. Maybe that's safe.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which might be bombs.\n\nWait, let me think about row3, column2 and column3. Row3 has '1 2 F F 1 ...'. So (3,1)=2, (3,2)=F, (3,3)=F, (3,4)=1.\n\nWait, (3,2) and (3,3) are flags. So that's two bombs there. The '2' at (3,1) must have two bombs adjacent. It already has (3,2) and (3,3) as flags, which are two bombs. So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at row4, column3 is '1'. Its adjacent squares include (3,2) and (3,3), which are flags. Wait, no, (3,2) and (3,3) are adjacent to (4,3)? Let me see: (4,3) is adjacent to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). So (3,2) and (3,3) are flags, which are two bombs. But (4,3) is a '1', which can only have one bomb adjacent. So that's a conflict. Because (4,3) is a '1', but it's adjacent to two flags at (3,2) and (3,3). That's a problem.\n\nWait, that's a conflict. So the '1' at (4,3) is adjacent to two flags, which would mean two bombs, but the '1' can only have one. So that's impossible. That means either one of those flags is incorrect, or the '1' is incorrect, which can't be because the game is ongoing.\n\nSo this indicates that there's a mistake in the flags. Because (4,3) is a '1', but it's adjacent to two flags, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in flag placement. So I need to remove one of the flags that's causing this conflict.\n\nLooking at the flags around (4,3): (3,2) and (3,3) are both flags. So if (4,3) is a '1', it can only have one bomb adjacent. Therefore, one of those flags must be incorrect.\n\nBut wait, (3,2) is a 'F' in the board state. Let me check the board again.\n\nRow3: 1 2 F F 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nSo (3,2) and (3,3) are both 'F's. So they are both flags. Therefore, (4,3) is a '1' adjacent to two flags, which is impossible.\n\nThis means that one of those flags must be wrong. So I need to remove one of them.\n\nWhich one should I remove? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the '2' at (3,1). It's adjacent to (3,2) and (3,3), which are both flags. So the '2' is satisfied because it has two bombs adjacent.\n\nBut the '1' at (4,3) is adjacent to both, which is a problem.\n\nTherefore, one of the flags at (3,2) or (3,3) must be incorrect. But since the '2' at (3,1) needs exactly two bombs, removing one flag would make the '2' have only one bomb, which is also a problem.\n\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, the initial assumption that both (3,2) and (3,3) are bombs must be incorrect. But since they are flagged, I must have made a mistake.\n\nSo, perhaps one of those flags should not be there. Let me see which one to remove.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (3,3), then the '2' at (3,1) would have only one bomb at (3,2), which is insufficient. So that's bad.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (3,2), then the '2' at (3,1) would have only one bomb at (3,3), which is also insufficient.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So both flags are necessary for the '2' at (3,1), but their presence causes the '1' at (4,3) to have two adjacent bombs, which is invalid.\n\nThis suggests that the initial flag placement is incorrect, and I need to remove one of them.\n\nBut which one? Maybe one of them is actually not a bomb, but the other is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the board.\n\nRow3: 1 2 F F 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nSo (3,2) and (3,3) are both 'F's, meaning flags.\n\nThe '2' at (3,1) is adjacent to (3,2) and (3,3), which are both flags. So that's correct for the '2'.\n\nBut the '1' at (4,3) is adjacent to both (3,2) and (3,3), which are two flags. So that's a conflict because a '1' can only have one bomb adjacent.\n\nThis is a critical conflict that needs to be resolved.\n\nTherefore, I must remove one of the flags at (3,2) or (3,3). But which one?\n\nIf I remove (3,2), then the '2' at (3,1) would have only one bomb at (3,3), which is insufficient. So that's bad.\n\nIf I remove (3,3), then the '2' at (3,1) would have only one bomb at (3,2), which is also insufficient.\n\nSo this is a problem. It seems like both flags are necessary, but they cause a conflict elsewhere.\n\nThis suggests that one of the flags must be incorrectly placed. But since I can't have both, I have to choose which one to remove.\n\nPerhaps I should look for other clues to determine which flag is incorrect.\n\nLooking at row4, column3 is '1'. It's adjacent to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4).\n\nIf (3,2) and (3,3) are both bombs, then (4,3) is a '1' with two bombs adjacent, which is impossible. Therefore, one of them must not be a bomb.\n\nBut the '2' at (3,1) needs two bombs adjacent, which are (3,2) and (3,3). So if one is not a bomb, the '2' is not satisfied.\n\nThis is a paradox. Therefore, the only solution is that one of the flags is incorrectly placed, and I need to remove it.\n\nBut which one? Let's see if there are other numbers that can help.\n\nLooking at row4, column4 is '1'. Its adjacent squares include (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nIf (3,3) is a bomb, then (4,4) is a '1' which would have one bomb adjacent. But (4,4) is a '1', so it can only have one bomb. If (3,3) is a bomb, then (4,4) is satisfied. But if (3,3) is not a bomb, then (4,4) must have another bomb nearby.\n\nAlternatively, if (3,2) is not a bomb, then (4,3) would have only one bomb at (3,3), which is correct.\n\nBut then the '2' at (3,1) would only have one bomb at (3,3), which is insufficient.\n\nSo this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag at (3,3) is incorrect, and it's actually a safe square. Then, the '2' at (3,1) would have only one bomb at (3,2), which is insufficient. So that's not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the flag at (3,2) is incorrect. Then, the '2' at (3,1) would have only one bomb at (3,3), which is insufficient. Also not good.\n\nThis is a tough spot. Maybe I need to consider that one of the flags is wrong and proceed accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal a square that can give me more information.\n\nLooking at row3, column4 is '1'. Its adjacent squares include (3,3), which is a flag. So if I reveal (3,4), maybe it's a number that can help.\n\nBut I can't reveal (3,4) because it's already revealed as '_'. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nRow3: 1 2 F F 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nSo (3,4) is '_', meaning it's revealed but empty. So it's safe. But that doesn't help me.\n\nWait, no, '_' means it's revealed but empty. So (3,4) is safe, but it's adjacent to (3,3), which is a flag. So that's fine.\n\nI'm stuck here. Maybe I should try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at row8, column2 is 'F'. Its adjacent squares include (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3). The '1's at (7,1) and (8,1) are satisfied by this flag.\n\nNow, looking at row7, column3 is '2'. Its adjacent squares include (6,2), which is a flag, and (7,2), (7,4), etc. So that's one bomb. So the '2' needs another bomb.\n\nLooking at row7, column4 is '2'. Its adjacent squares include (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). There's a flag at (8,2), but that's not adjacent. So the '2' needs two bombs nearby.\n\nWait, perhaps (7,5) is a bomb. If I flag (7,5), then the '2' at (7,3) would have two bombs: (6,2) and (7,5). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row5, column7 is '2'. Its adjacent squares include (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). If I can find two bombs here, that would satisfy the '2'.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to reveal a square that's likely safe.\n\nLooking at row9, column0 is '_'. It's in the bottom-left corner. Revealing it might be safe.\n\nAlternatively, row0, column0 is '_'. Revealing it might give me a number.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, I could look for a square that is adjacent to a '1' and has only one possibility.\n\nWait, looking back at row4, column3 is '1', which is adjacent to two flags. That's the conflict. So I need to resolve that.\n\nPerhaps I should remove one of the flags at (3,2) or (3,3). Let's say I remove the flag at (3,3). Then, the '2' at (3,1) would have only one bomb at (3,2), which is insufficient. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, remove the flag at (3,2). Then, the '2' at (3,1) would have only one bomb at (3,3), which is also insufficient.\n\nThis is a problem. Maybe the initial flags are incorrect, and I need to remove one.\n\nBut since I can't have both, I have to choose. Perhaps I should remove the flag at (3,3), and see if that helps.\n\nSo, I would make a move to remove the flag at (3,3). That is, x=3, y=3, flag=true (to remove it). Wait, no, to remove a flag, I need to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So the move would be (3,3), flag=true.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, perhaps I should remove the flag at (3,2).\n\nBut I'm not certain. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that can help me determine which flag is incorrect.\n\nFor example, if I reveal (3,4), which is adjacent to (3,3), and if it's a '0', that would mean no bombs around it, which would confirm that (3,3) is not a bomb. But (3,4) is already revealed as '_', which is empty, but it doesn't show a number. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (4,4), which is adjacent to (3,3). If (4,4) is a '0', that would mean no bombs around it, implying (3,3) is not a bomb. But (4,4) is '_', so it's empty but not numbered.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLooking at row5, column7 is '2'. Its adjacent squares are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). None of these are flagged. So I need to find two bombs here.\n\nBut I don't have enough information. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row6, column5 is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). None are flagged. So the '1' must have one bomb nearby. Maybe (5,5) is a bomb.\n\nBut I can't be sure. Alternatively, maybe (7,5) is a bomb.\n\nI'm not making progress. Maybe I should consider that the conflict at (4,3) indicates that one of the flags is wrong, and I should remove one.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should remove the flag at (3,3). So the move would be (3,3), flag=true.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, I could remove the flag at (3,2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal a square that can clarify this.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should take a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for other conflicts.\n\nLooking at row8, column2 is 'F'. The adjacent '1's at (7,1) and (8,1) are satisfied. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at row6, column2 is 'F'. The adjacent '1's at (5,1) and (5,3) are satisfied. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at row4, column1 is 'F'. The adjacent '1's at (3,1) and (5,1) are satisfied. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at row2, column3 is 'F'. The adjacent '1's at (1,3) and (2,4) are satisfied. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at row0, column9 is 'F'. The adjacent '1' at (0,8) is satisfied. So that's okay.\n\nSo the only conflict is at (4,3). Therefore, I must address that.\n\nI think the best move is to remove one of the conflicting flags. Let's choose (3,3). So the move would be (3,3), flag=true.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, I could remove (3,2).\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to decide. Given that, perhaps removing (3,3) is better because (3,3) is adjacent to (4,3)'s '1', which is causing the conflict.\n\nSo, I'll make the move to remove the flag at (3,3).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The '1' at (4,3) is adjacent to two flags at (3,2) and (3,3), which is impossible since a '1' can only have one adjacent bomb. To resolve this conflict, I'm removing the flag at (3,3).\n\nMOVE: 3,3,true", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 F . .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 1, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the game info. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 3 flags remaining, so I can place up to 3 more flags if needed. My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without hitting a mine.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the board step by step to see if there are any obvious conflicts or places where I can safely reveal a tile or place a flag.\n\nLooking at row 0, columns 8 and 9: position (0,8) is 1, and (0,9) is F (flagged). So, the 1 at (0,8) indicates that there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. Since (0,9) is already flagged, that must be the only bomb adjacent to (0,8). That means the other surrounding squares of (0,8) should be safe. Let me check the neighbors of (0,8): up is (1,8), which is 1, left is (0,7), which is _, and down is (1,8). Wait, maybe I should look at the adjacent squares more carefully.\n\nWait, (0,8) is 1, and it's at the top row, so its adjacent squares would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). But (0,9) is already flagged, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other squares around (0,8) must be safe. So, (0,7) is _, which I could potentially reveal. But I should check if revealing it would cause any issues.\n\nWait, no, (0,8) is a 1, and it's adjacent to a flag at (0,9). So the 1 is satisfied by that flag, meaning the other adjacent squares must be safe. So, (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) should be safe. But (1,8) is 1, which is another number. Let me check what (1,8) is. Oh, (1,8) is 1. So, (1,8) is a 1, meaning it has exactly one bomb adjacent to it. Let me see where that bomb could be.\n\nThe neighbors of (1,8) are (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), and (2,9). We know (0,9) is a flag, so that's one bomb. But (1,8) is 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. So, that must be (0,9), meaning all other adjacent squares must be safe. Therefore, (0,7), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), and (2,9) should be safe. Wait, but (2,8) is 1 as well, according to the board. Let me check the board again.\n\nWait, looking back, row 2, column 8 is 1. So, (2,8) is 1. So, (2,8) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Let me check its neighbors: (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). Hmm, but I'm not sure where the bomb is for (2,8). Maybe I should look elsewhere for easier moves.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 2 is 2, which means there are two bombs adjacent to it. Its neighbors are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). Let me see if any of these are already flags or numbers. (8,2) is F, so that's one bomb. So, (7,2) is 2, so there must be another bomb adjacent to it. The remaining possible squares are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3). But I don't see any flags in those except (8,2). So, there must be another bomb somewhere around (7,2). Maybe I can find it by looking at other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 2 is F, which is a flag. So that's one bomb accounted for in the count for (7,2). So, the other bomb must be in one of the other adjacent squares. Let me check if any of the surrounding numbers can help. For example, (7,1) is 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. Since (7,1) is 1, and it's adjacent to (8,2) which is a flag, that must be its only bomb. Therefore, the other squares around (7,1) must be safe. So, (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (8,0), (8,1), (7,2) are the neighbors. Since (7,2) is 2 and (8,2) is F, (7,1) can't have any other bombs adjacent, so the other bomb for (7,2) must be somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 6, column 6 is 1. Let me check its neighbors. (6,6) is 1, so it must have one bomb adjacent. Its neighbors are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). I don't see any flags around it yet. So, maybe that's a place to reveal, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5 is 1. Its neighbors are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (6,6) is 1, so if I reveal (5,5), maybe I can get more info.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, column 2 is F. So, that's another flag. Let me see if that affects any numbers around it. (3,2) is F, so it's a bomb. Let me check the numbers around it to see if they make sense.\n\nFor example, (2,1) is 1. Its neighbors are (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). Since (3,2) is F, that's the bomb that (2,1) is indicating. So, the other neighbors of (2,1) must be safe. Therefore, (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1) are all safe. So, I could potentially reveal some of these, but I'm not sure if that's the best move.\n\nWait, looking at row 2, column 0 is F. So that's another flag. Let me see if that affects any numbers. (2,0) is F, so it's a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. For example, (1,0) is 1. Its neighbors are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). Since (2,0) is F, that's the bomb that (1,0) is indicating, so the other squares around (1,0) must be safe. Therefore, (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) are safe. So, I could reveal some of these, but again, maybe not the best move.\n\nLet me think about the number of flags I have left: 3. There are 10 bombs in total, and I have 3 flags placed already. So, I need to place 7 more flags, but I only have 3 left. Wait, no, the game info says \"Flags remaining: 3\". So, I can place 3 more flags. So, I have to be careful where I place them.\n\nLet me look for any obvious places where a flag must be placed based on the numbers. For example, if a square is a 1 and has only one possible spot for a bomb, I can flag that. Or if a square is a 2 and has only one flag adjacent, I can flag another.\n\nLooking back at row 0, column 8 is 1, and it's adjacent to a flag at (0,9). So, that's one bomb. So, the other squares around (0,8) must be safe. So, (0,7) is empty and could be revealed. Let me check (0,7). If I reveal (0,7), what happens? Let me see the neighbors of (0,7): (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,8) is 1, (1,8) is 1. So, if I reveal (0,7), it's possible that it's a number or safe. But maybe it's better to see if revealing it helps with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 1, column 8 is 1. Its neighbors are (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). We know (0,9) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So, the other squares around (1,8) must be safe. Therefore, (0,7), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9) are safe. So, revealing (1,7) or (1,9) could be safe, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.\n\nWait, looking at row 2, column 8 is 1. Its neighbors are (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). Since (1,8) is 1 and (0,9) is a flag, maybe that's the only bomb adjacent to (2,8). So, the other squares around (2,8) must be safe. Therefore, (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9) are safe. So, I could reveal some of these.\n\nBut maybe I should look for a place where a number indicates that a certain square must be a bomb. For example, if a square is a 1 and all adjacent squares except one are revealed as safe, then the remaining must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5 is 1. Its neighbors are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (6,6) is 1, so if I can determine where the bomb is, maybe I can flag it.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, column 2 is 2. We know (8,2) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So, the other bomb must be somewhere else around (7,2). Let me check the possible squares: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3). I don't see any other flags here, so maybe one of these is the other bomb.\n\nWait, (7,1) is 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. Since (7,1) is adjacent to (8,2) which is a flag, that must be its only bomb. Therefore, the other squares around (7,1) must be safe. So, the other bomb for (7,2) must be in (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,3), (8,1), or (8,3). But I don't see any flags in those positions yet.\n\nMaybe I can look for other numbers that can help. For example, row 4, column 1 is F, which is a flag. So, that's a bomb. Let me check the numbers around it to see if they make sense.\n\n(4,1) is F, so it's a bomb. Let's look at the numbers around it. For example, (3,0) is 1, which is adjacent to (4,1). So, (3,0) is 1, and it's adjacent to a bomb at (4,1). Therefore, the other squares around (3,0) must be safe. So, (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0) are safe.\n\nWait, (3,0) is 1, and it's adjacent to (4,1) which is a flag. So, that's the only bomb. So, the other squares around (3,0) must be safe. So, (2,0) is F, which is another bomb. Wait, no, (2,0) is F, so that's a bomb. So, (3,0) is 1, and it's adjacent to (4,1) and (2,0), both of which are flags. That can't be, because (3,0) is 1, meaning it should have only one bomb adjacent. But it's adjacent to two flags, which would mean two bombs, which contradicts the 1. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, this is a conflict. (3,0) is 1, but it's adjacent to two flags: (2,0) and (4,1). That's a problem because a 1 can only have one bomb adjacent. So, this suggests that either (2,0) or (4,1) is incorrectly flagged, or (3,0) is mislabeled.\n\nBut in the game, the board is given, so I have to work with it. So, perhaps one of those flags is incorrect. But I can't remove a flag unless I make a move to do so. So, maybe I should consider removing one of those flags.\n\nBut I only have 3 flags left, and I have to be careful. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal (3,0) to see if it's a bomb, but that's risky because if it's a bomb, the game ends.\n\nWait, (3,0) is 1, so it's safe. It's a number, not a mine. So, if I reveal it, it's safe. But wait, no, (3,0) is 1, which means it's a revealed square with the number 1, indicating one bomb adjacent. So, it's already revealed, so I can't reveal it again. So, the fact that it's adjacent to two flags is a problem. So, perhaps one of those flags is incorrect.\n\nSo, I have to figure out which one is wrong. Let's check the flags at (2,0) and (4,1). Let's see what other numbers are around them.\n\nLooking at (2,0) is F. Let's check the numbers around it. (1,0) is 1, which is adjacent to (2,0). So, (1,0) is 1, meaning it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0) is a flag, that's the one bomb. So, the other squares around (1,0) must be safe. Therefore, (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) are safe.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is F. Let's check the numbers around it. (3,0) is 1, which is adjacent to (4,1), so that's one bomb. (3,1) is 2, which is adjacent to (4,1), so that's one bomb. (4,0) is _, which is empty, and (4,2) is F, which is another flag. Wait, (4,2) is F as well? Let me check the board again.\n\nWait, looking back, row 4, column 2 is F. So, (4,2) is F. So, (4,1) is F, and (4,2) is F. That's two flags adjacent to (3,1), which is 2. So, (3,1) is 2, meaning it should have two bombs adjacent. Since (4,1) and (4,2) are both flags, that's two bombs, which fits. So, that's okay.\n\nBut going back to (3,0), which is 1, and it's adjacent to two flags: (2,0) and (4,1). That's a problem because it should only have one bomb adjacent. So, one of these flags must be incorrect. Therefore, either (2,0) or (4,1) is not a bomb.\n\nSo, I have to decide which one is incorrect. Let's look at the numbers around (2,0). (1,0) is 1, which is adjacent to (2,0). So, (1,0) is 1, which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. If (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,0) is correct. If (2,0) is not a bomb, then (1,0) would have zero bombs adjacent, which contradicts the 1.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is adjacent to (3,0) which is 1, so (3,0) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. If (4,1) is a bomb, then (3,0) is correct. If (4,1) is not a bomb, then (3,0) would have zero bombs adjacent, which is also a contradiction.\n\nSo, this is a problem because both (2,0) and (4,1) are flags, but they can't both be bombs because (3,0) is 1. Therefore, one of them must be incorrectly flagged.\n\nSo, I need to figure out which one is the actual bomb. Let's see if other numbers can help.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 3 is F. So, (2,3) is a flag. Let's check the numbers around it. (1,2) is 1, which is adjacent to (2,3). So, (1,2) is 1, which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,3) is a flag, that's the one bomb. So, the other squares around (1,2) must be safe. Therefore, (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2) are safe.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is a flag, so it's a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. (1,2) is 1, which we already considered. (1,3) is 2, which is adjacent to (2,3), so that's one bomb. (2,2) is _, and (2,4) is F. So, (2,4) is another flag. Let me check (2,4). It's a flag, so it's a bomb.\n\nWait, (2,4) is F, so it's a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. (1,3) is 2, which is adjacent to (2,4). So, (1,3) is 2, which must have two bombs adjacent. Since (2,4) is a flag, that's one bomb. The other must be somewhere else around (1,3). Let's see: neighbors are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (2,3) is a flag, so that's another bomb. So, (1,3) is 2, which is satisfied by (2,3) and (2,4). So, that's okay.\n\nBut going back to (3,0), which is 1 and adjacent to two flags, which is a problem. So, perhaps one of those flags is incorrect.\n\nLet me think: If (2,0) is not a bomb, then (1,0) is 1, which would have zero bombs adjacent, which is a contradiction. So, (2,0) must be a bomb. Therefore, (3,0) is 1, which is adjacent to (2,0) and (4,1). Since (2,0) is a bomb, (3,0) should only have one bomb adjacent, so (4,1) must not be a bomb. Therefore, (4,1) is incorrectly flagged.\n\nSo, I should remove the flag at (4,1). But how? Because to remove a flag, I have to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So, I can do that.\n\nSo, my next move would be to remove the flag at (4,1). That would free up a flag slot, and correct the conflict at (3,0).\n\nAfter that, (3,0) is 1, which is correctly adjacent to (2,0). And (4,1) is no longer a flag, so it's just an empty square. But then, since (4,1) was a flag, and I removed it, I have to consider if that affects other numbers.\n\nWait, (4,1) was a flag, so if I remove it, that square is now empty. But (3,1) is 2, which was adjacent to (4,1) and (4,2). So, (3,1) is 2, which needs two bombs adjacent. Since (4,2) is still a flag, that's one bomb. So, the other bomb must be somewhere else around (3,1). Let me check the neighbors of (3,1): (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) is a flag, (4,2) is a flag. So, that's two bombs, which fits the 2. So, even after removing (4,1), (3,1) is still satisfied by (2,0) and (4,2). So, that's okay.\n\nTherefore, removing the flag at (4,1) would resolve the conflict at (3,0) and not affect (3,1). So, that seems like a good move.\n\nSo, my next move is to remove the flag at (4,1). That would be a move with flag=true on (4,1), since it's already flagged. So, the move would be (4,1, true). Wait, no, to remove a flag, I have to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I can't remove it because it's not allowed, but according to the rules, I can. So, that's the move I should make.\n\nAfter that, I can proceed to place flags elsewhere if needed, but for now, that's the critical move to fix the conflict.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Removing the flag at (4,1) resolves the conflict where (3,0) is a '1' adjacent to two flags. This corrects the board state by eliminating the overcounting of bombs, ensuring the '1' at (3,0) only has one adjacent bomb at (2,0).\n\nMOVE: 4,1,true", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the game info.\n\nThe board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 4 flags remaining, so I can place up to 4 more flags if needed. My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without hitting a mine.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice that some squares are already revealed with numbers, some are flagged with 'F', and others are still unexplored ('.'). I should check the revealed numbers to see if they can help me deduce where the bombs are.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each revealed number and see if the adjacent flags or numbers conflict with them. For example, if a square shows a '1', it means exactly one bomb is adjacent to it. If there are already flags around it, that might indicate a conflict.\n\nStarting from the top, row 0 has a '1' at (0,8) and an 'F' at (0,9). Since the '1' is at (0,8), it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (0,8) are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), and (1,8). (0,9) is already flagged, so that's one bomb accounted for. Therefore, the other adjacent squares shouldn't have any more bombs because the count is already satisfied. So, (0,7), (1,7), and (1,8) should be safe. Wait, but (1,8) is a '1' in row 1, so maybe that's a different case.\n\nWait, row 1 has a '1' at (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). Hmm, that's a lot of '1's. Let me check each one.\n\nLooking at (1,0): it's a '1' with adjacent squares. The possible bombs could be around it. But I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should look for squares where the number and flags could conflict.\n\nLooking at row 2, there's an 'F' at (2,0) and (2,3). So those are flagged as bombs. Let's see if the numbers around them make sense.\n\nFor example, the square at (1,1) is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), and (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Since (1,0) is a '1' and (2,0) is a flag, maybe that's okay because the '1' could be counting the flag at (2,0). But I'm not sure if there are more bombs around.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a square where the number plus the existing flags exceed the number, which would indicate a conflict. For example, if a '1' has two flags adjacent, that's a problem because the number should only have one bomb nearby.\n\nLooking at row 8, there's an 'F' at (8,2). The square at (7,2) is a '2'. So, (7,2) is a '2' and has a flag at (8,2). That means there should be exactly two bombs adjacent to (7,2). Since one is already flagged, there must be another bomb nearby. So, I should check the other adjacent squares to (7,2) for possible bombs.\n\nThe adjacent squares to (7,2) are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). We know (8,2) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So, there must be another bomb in the remaining squares. Looking at those, (6,2) is a '1' in row 6, column 2. Wait, no, row 6, column 2 is '.' because in row 6, it's \"_ _ _ _ _ 1 . F . .\". So, (6,2) is unexplored, but (6,5) is '1'. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, row 6 is: _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F . . So, (6,5) is '1', and (6,7) is 'F'. So, the '1' at (6,5) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (6,5) are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). Since (6,5) is '1', there must be exactly one bomb in these squares. But I don't know where yet.\n\nGoing back to (7,2) which is '2' and has a flag at (8,2). So, another bomb must be in the adjacent squares. Let me check the squares around (7,2). (7,1) is '2', (7,3) is '2', (8,1) is '1', (8,3) is '.', (6,1) is '.', (6,2) is '.', (6,3) is '.'.\n\nWait, (7,1) is '2' and (7,3) is '2'. So, each of these must have exactly two bombs adjacent. Since (7,2) is '2' and already has one flag at (8,2), the other bomb could be in (7,1) or (7,3), but those are '2's themselves. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can find a square where the number and the flags around it indicate that a certain square must be a bomb or must be safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is '1' and column 9 is 'F'. So, the '1' at (0,8) is satisfied by the flag at (0,9). Therefore, the other adjacent squares around (0,8) must be safe. So, (0,7), (1,7), and (1,8) should be safe. Wait, but (1,8) is a '1' in row 1. So, if (1,8) is a '1', and (0,8) is a '1' that's already accounted for by (0,9), then (1,8) must have another bomb adjacent. So, perhaps (1,8)'s '1' is counting a different bomb.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the rows. Let me clarify:\n\nRow 0: columns 8 is '1', 9 is 'F'.\n\nRow 1: columns 0-2 are '1's, and columns 7,8,9 are '1's.\n\nSo, (1,8) is a '1', which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). Since (0,8) is a '1' and (0,9) is a flag, perhaps (1,8)'s '1' is counting a different bomb, maybe in (2,8) or (2,7), but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that's a '1' with only one possible place for a bomb, given the existing flags.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 5 is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). Since it's a '1', there must be exactly one bomb in these squares. But I don't know where yet.\n\nWait, row 7, column 2 is '2' and has a flag at (8,2). So, another bomb must be adjacent. Let me check the squares around (7,2):\n\n- (6,1): unexplored\n- (6,2): unexplored\n- (6,3): unexplored\n- (7,1): '2'\n- (7,3): '2'\n- (8,1): '1'\n- (8,3): unexplored\n\nSo, the '2' at (7,2) needs another bomb. The '2's at (7,1) and (7,3) also need two bombs each. Hmm.\n\nWait, the square at (8,1) is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). Since (8,1) is '1', it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. We know (7,2) is '2' and (8,2) is 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, (8,1)'s '1' is satisfied by the flag at (8,2). So, the other adjacent squares around (8,1) must be safe. Therefore, (7,0), (7,1), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2) should be safe.\n\nBut (7,1) is a '2', which must have two bombs adjacent. Since (8,2) is a flag, that's one bomb, so there must be another bomb adjacent to (7,1). The possible squares are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). We already have (8,2) as a flag, so another bomb must be in one of the other squares. But since (8,1) is '1' and already accounted for by (8,2), the other squares around (7,1) must have another bomb. But I don't know where yet.\n\nThis is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should look for a square that's a '1' with only one possible bomb location, given the existing flags and numbers.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5 is unexplored, but row 4, column 1 is '1'. Let's see. (4,1) is '1', so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). But I don't know the state of these squares yet.\n\nWait, row 5, column 1 is '1', and row 5, column 2 is '1', column 3 is '1', column 5 is '1'. So, maybe there's a cluster of '1's here. Each of these must have exactly one bomb adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's a '1' with an adjacent flag, so the other squares around it must be safe.\n\nFor example, (0,8) is '1' with a flag at (0,9). So, the other adjacent squares (0,7), (1,7), (1,8) must be safe. But (1,8) is a '1', which complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe I can reveal (1,8) because it's a '1' and see if it's safe. But no, I can't reveal it because it's already a '1'; I need to reveal the unexplored squares. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's a '2' with only one possible bomb location left. For example, (7,2) is '2' with a flag at (8,2), so another bomb must be adjacent. Let me check the squares around (7,2) again.\n\nThe possible squares are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3). Since (8,2) is a flag, one bomb is accounted for. So, another must be in one of these. Let's see:\n\n- (6,1): unexplored\n- (6,2): unexplored\n- (6,3): unexplored\n- (7,1): '2'\n- (7,3): '2'\n- (8,1): '1'\n- (8,3): unexplored\n\nSo, perhaps (7,1) or (7,3) have another bomb. But since (7,1) is '2', it needs two bombs. One could be at (8,2), and another somewhere else. Similarly, (7,3) is '2', so it needs two bombs.\n\nWait, (8,1) is '1', which is satisfied by (8,2). So, (8,1) doesn't need any more bombs. Therefore, the other bombs for (7,1) and (7,3) must be in their other adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at (7,1): adjacent squares are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). We know (8,2) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So, another bomb must be in one of the other squares. Similarly for (7,3).\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that's a '1' with only one possible flag placement.\n\nWait, looking at row 9, column 1 is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). Since (8,2) is a flag, that's one bomb. So, (9,1)'s '1' is satisfied by (8,2). Therefore, the other adjacent squares around (9,1) must be safe. So, (8,0), (8,1), (9,0), (9,2) are safe. But I don't know if that helps me place a flag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's a '1' with no adjacent flags, so I can deduce where the bomb must be.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 1 is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Since (2,0) is a flag, that's one bomb, so the other squares must be safe. Therefore, (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) are safe.\n\nWait, but (3,1) is '1', so it's already accounted for by (2,0). So, the other squares around it are safe. That might help in revealing some squares, but I'm not sure where to go next.\n\nMaybe I should consider the number of flags remaining. I have 4 flags left, and there are 10 bombs in total. Let me count how many flags are already placed.\n\nLooking at the board, I see 'F's at:\n\n- (0,9)\n- (2,0)\n- (2,3)\n- (6,7)\n- (8,2)\n\nWait, that's 5 flags already. But the game info says flags remaining: 4. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) is 'F' \u2192 1\nRow 2: (2,0) and (2,3) \u2192 2 more \u2192 total 3\nRow 6: (6,7) \u2192 4\nRow 8: (8,2) \u2192 5\n\nSo, 5 flags are placed, but the game info says flags remaining: 4. That suggests that I can place up to 4 more flags, making a total of 9, but there are 10 bombs. So, maybe I need to place 5 more flags, but the info says 4 remaining. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the game info says \"Flags remaining: 4\", which probably means I can place 4 more flags because some are already placed.\n\nWait, the total number of bombs is 10. If I have already placed 5 flags, then I have 5 left to place, but the game info says 4 remaining. That suggests that I have 4 flags left to place, so I must have placed 6 already. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) \u2192 1\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,3) \u2192 2 more \u2192 total 3\nRow 6: (6,7) \u2192 4\nRow 8: (8,2) \u2192 5\nSo, 5 flags are already placed, and the game allows 10 bombs, so I can place 5 more, but the game info says flags remaining:4. So, perhaps the info is that I have 4 flags left to place, meaning I've already placed 6. But I only see 5. Maybe I missed one.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: (0,9)\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,3)\nRow 6: (6,7)\nRow 8: (8,2)\nThat's 5. Maybe there's another 'F' I missed.\n\nLooking at row 4: (4,4) is '_', so no. Row 5: all '.' except (5,5) which is '1'. Row 7: (7,2) is '2', no. Row 9: (9,1) is '1'. So, I think it's 5 flags. So, perhaps the game info is wrong, or I'm miscounting. Maybe I should proceed, assuming that I have 4 flags left to place.\n\nGiven that, I need to decide whether to place a flag or reveal a square. Since I have flags left, maybe I can place a flag where I'm certain there's a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking back at (7,2) which is '2' and has a flag at (8,2). So, another bomb must be adjacent. Let's see, perhaps (7,1) or (7,3) are '2's, so they need two bombs each. But I don't know where.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at (6,5) which is '1'. Its adjacent squares must have exactly one bomb. The adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). Since (6,5) is '1', only one of these is a bomb.\n\nLooking at these squares, (5,5) is '1' in row 5, so that's a '1' which must have one bomb adjacent. So, perhaps (5,5) is a '1' that's already counting a bomb. Maybe (5,5)'s bomb is at (5,4) or (5,6) or (6,5), but (6,5) is '1', so that's a different square.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a square that's a '1' with only one possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at (5,5) which is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Since (5,5) is '1', exactly one of these is a bomb. But I don't know which one.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (4,1) which is '1'. Its adjacent squares include (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Since (3,1) is '2', which is a different case.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the number of flags I have left is 4, and I need to place them correctly. So, perhaps I can look for a square that's a '1' with an adjacent flag, so the other squares must be safe, allowing me to reveal some squares without risk.\n\nFor example, (0,8) is '1' with a flag at (0,9). So, the other adjacent squares must be safe. Therefore, I can reveal (0,7), (1,7), and (1,8). But (1,8) is a '1', so revealing it would just show me the number, but I can't reveal it because it's already a number. Wait, no, (1,8) is a '1', so it's already revealed. So, perhaps I can reveal (0,7) and (1,7), which should be safe.\n\nBut wait, (0,7) is adjacent to (0,8)'s '1', which is already satisfied by (0,9). So, (0,7) should be safe. Similarly, (1,7) is adjacent to (1,8)'s '1', which is satisfied by a different bomb. Wait, no, (1,8)'s '1' must have exactly one bomb adjacent, which could be (2,8) or another square. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reveal (0,7) because it's adjacent to a '1' that's already satisfied by a flag. So, (0,7) should be safe. If I reveal it and it's a '0', that would help me clear more squares.\n\nBut since I'm not sure, maybe it's safer to place a flag where I'm certain. However, I don't have any obvious squares to flag right now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's a '2' with only one possible bomb location left. For example, (7,2) is '2' with a flag at (8,2). So, another bomb must be in the adjacent squares. Let's check (7,1) and (7,3), which are both '2's. Each of these must have two bombs adjacent. Since (8,2) is a flag, that's one bomb for each. So, each needs another bomb.\n\nLooking at (7,1): adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). We know (8,2) is a flag, so another bomb must be in one of the other squares. Similarly, (7,3) is '2', so it needs another bomb besides (8,2).\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe I should make an educated guess. Since I have flags left, perhaps I can place a flag at (7,1) or (7,3), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can reveal a square that's likely to be safe based on the numbers.\n\nWait, looking at row 9, column 1 is '1'. Its adjacent squares include (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). Since (8,2) is a flag, that's one bomb, so (9,1)'s '1' is satisfied. Therefore, the other adjacent squares must be safe. So, (8,0), (8,1), (9,0), (9,2) are safe. Therefore, I can reveal these squares without worrying about bombs.\n\nBut (8,0) is in row 8, which is mostly unexplored. If I reveal (8,0) and it's a '0', that would help me clear more squares. However, I'm not sure if it's safe. Alternatively, since (9,1) is '1' and accounted for by (8,2), the other squares around (9,1) are safe, so revealing them would be safe.\n\nTherefore, maybe I can reveal (8,0). If it's a '0', I can clear the surrounding squares. If it's a number, I can use that info.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's a '1' with only one possible bomb location.\n\nWait, looking at (3,1) which is '2'. Its adjacent squares include (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Since (2,0) is a flag, that's one bomb, so another must be in the adjacent squares. Therefore, (3,1)'s '2' is satisfied by (2,0) and another bomb. So, perhaps (2,1) or (3,2) is a bomb.\n\nBut I don't know yet. This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should make a move based on the info I have.\n\nSince I have 4 flags left, and I need to place them correctly, I should look for squares where the numbers indicate a bomb must be there. Alternatively, I can reveal a square that's likely safe.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can reveal (0,7) because it's adjacent to a '1' that's already satisfied by a flag. So, (0,7) should be safe.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe I can reveal (9,0) because it's adjacent to (9,1)'s '1', which is satisfied by (8,2). So, (9,0) should be safe.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing (0,7) because it's adjacent to a '1' that's already accounted for by a flag. So, it's likely safe.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (0,7) because it's adjacent to a '1' at (0,8) which is already satisfied by a flag at (0,9), making (0,7) likely safe.\nMOVE: 0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 4, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 0, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. We have 4 flags remaining, which means we can place 4 more flags if needed. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice that some squares are already revealed with numbers, some are flagged, and others are still unexplored. My first thought is to check the revealed numbers and see if any of them have conflicting flags nearby. According to the rules, each number must exactly match the number of adjacent bombs, so if a '1' has two flags next to it, that's a conflict and the game would be over, but in this case, I don't see any immediate conflicts.\n\nI'll start by examining the revealed tiles and their numbers to see if I can deduce any patterns or possible bomb locations.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is a '1', which means there's exactly one bomb in the surrounding eight squares. The surrounding squares would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). But (0,7) is a '1', (1,7) is a '.', (1,8) is a '1', and (1,9) is a '.'. Wait, no, row 0, column 8 is '1', so the adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), and (1,8). (0,7) is '1', (0,9) is 'F', which is a flag. So the '1' at (0,8) has a flag at (0,9), which counts as one bomb. Therefore, there should be no other bombs adjacent to (0,8). That means the other adjacent squares, which are (1,7), (1,8), and (0,7) (which is a '1'), can't have bombs. But (1,8) is a '1', so maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for tiles with numbers that have all their adjacent squares either revealed or flagged, which might help me deduce where bombs are.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 0 is an 'F', which is a flag. Then, row 2, column 3 is an 'F' as well. So that's two flags in row 2. The board has 10 bombs, and we have 4 flags remaining, so maybe I can place more flags where I'm certain there are bombs.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 2 is an 'F', so that's another flag. Row 6, column 7 is an 'F', making it four flags in total. Wait, no, the flags remaining are 4, so perhaps the current flags are already placed, and I can place up to 4 more. Wait, the game info says flags remaining: 4, so I can place 4 more flags.\n\nWait, no, in Minesweeper, the number of flags is equal to the number of bombs. Since there are 10 bombs, and the flags remaining are 4, that means 6 flags have already been placed. Looking at the board, I count the 'F's:\n\n- Row 0, column 9: F\n- Row 2, column 0: F\n- Row 2, column 3: F\n- Row 3, column 2: F\n- Row 6, column 7: F\n- Row 8, column 2: F\n\nWait, that's 6 flags, so flags remaining are 4. So I can place 4 more flags.\n\nNow, I need to find where to place these flags without conflicting with the revealed numbers.\n\nLooking at row 1, columns 0,1,2 are all '1's. So each of these must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Let's look at row 1, column 0: it's a '1'. The adjacent squares would be (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0), (2,1). (2,0) is an 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, the '1' at (1,0) is satisfied, so no other bombs can be adjacent. So the other adjacent squares, like (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) cannot have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 1 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). But (2,0) is an 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, no other bombs can be adjacent to (1,1). So the other squares around it can't have bombs.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 2 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (2,3) is an 'F', so that's one bomb. So no other bombs can be adjacent to (1,2).\n\nThis suggests that the squares around these '1's in row 1 cannot have bombs, which might help in deducing other areas.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is a '1', and it's adjacent to (0,9) which is an 'F'. So that's one bomb, so the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. Therefore, (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (0,9) are the adjacent squares. Since (0,9) is an 'F', the others can't be bombs.\n\nNow, looking at row 4, column 1 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares would be (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). But I don't know much about these areas yet.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 1 is a '2'. That means there are two bombs adjacent to it. Let's check its adjacent squares: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). I don't know much about these yet, but maybe I can find a pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for tiles that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which might help me pinpoint where the bombs are.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 0 is an 'F', and row 2, column 3 is an 'F'. So in row 2, columns 0 and 3 are flagged. The '1's in row 1, columns 0,1,2 suggest that their adjacent squares can't have bombs except for the flags.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at row 3, column 2 is an 'F', so that's another bomb. So that's three flags so far.\n\nI think I need to find a tile that is adjacent to a number that can only be satisfied by a specific square being a bomb. For example, if a '1' has only one possible square left that could be a bomb, then that square must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is a '1', and it's adjacent to (0,9) which is an 'F'. So that's one bomb, so the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. Therefore, (0,7), (1,7), (1,8) can't have bombs.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 8 is a '1', which is adjacent to (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,8), (2,9). (0,9) is an 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. So (1,9) is a '.' and can't be a bomb. Wait, no, (1,9) is a '.' so it's unexplored, but according to the '1' at (1,8), it can't have a bomb because (0,9) is already a flag.\n\nWait, no. The '1' at (1,8) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). We know (0,9) is an 'F', which is a bomb, so that's one. So the other squares can't have bombs. Therefore, (1,9) can't be a bomb because it's adjacent to (1,8)'s '1' which already has one bomb.\n\nSo, (1,9) is safe. Maybe I can reveal that, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares would include (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Not sure about these yet.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 7 is an 'F', so that's another bomb.\n\nI think I should look for a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and can only have one possible bomb location.\n\nWait, let me check row 8, column 2 is an 'F', so that's another bomb.\n\nSo far, I've identified flags at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (3,2), (6,7), (8,2). That's six flags, and I can place four more.\n\nI need to find where to place the next flag. Maybe I can look for a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and is the only possible location for a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0 is an empty revealed square '_'. It's adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Since (1,0) is a '1', which already has a flag at (2,0), so (0,0) can't have a bomb. So maybe I can reveal (0,0) to see if it's a number or not.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9, column 1 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,2) is an 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. So (9,0) and (9,2) can't be bombs. So (9,1) is a '1' with one bomb at (8,2), so the other squares around it can't have bombs.\n\nWait, but (9,0) is a '.' so it's unexplored. But according to the '1' at (9,1), (9,0) can't be a bomb because the only bomb is at (8,2). So (9,0) is safe. Maybe I can reveal it.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a tile that is adjacent to multiple numbers, which can help me deduce a bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 4 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at row 7, column 1 is a '2'. Its adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (8,2) is an 'F', so that's one bomb. So the '2' at (7,1) needs another bomb adjacent. So one of the other squares must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (7,0), which is a '.', and (6,0), which is a '.' as well. Also, (6,1) is a '1' in row 6, column 1. Wait, row 6, column 1 is a '1'. So (6,1) is a '1', which means it has exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2). Since (7,1) is a '2', which already has one bomb at (8,2), it needs another bomb. But (6,1) is a '1', which can only have one bomb. So if (6,1) is a '1', and (7,1) is a '2', perhaps the bomb for (6,1) is at (5,1), and the bomb for (7,1) is at (6,2) or (7,0), etc.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and can only have one possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). If I can find that one of these squares is the only possible bomb, then I can flag it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 9, column 1 is a '1', which has a flag at (8,2). So the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. So (9,0) is safe, as I thought earlier.\n\nMaybe I can reveal (9,0) to see what's there. If it's a number, it might help me deduce more.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the safest move. Alternatively, I could look for a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and is the only possible location for a bomb.\n\nWait, looking at row 4, column 7 is a '2'. Its adjacent squares include (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). Not sure yet.\n\nI think I need to find a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and can only have one possible bomb location. Let me check row 5, column 4 again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 3, column 4 is a '2'. Its adjacent squares include (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is an 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, the '2' at (3,4) needs another bomb adjacent. So one of the other squares must be a bomb. Perhaps (3,5) or (4,5), etc.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should consider the number of remaining bombs. There are 10 bombs in total, and I've already placed 6 flags, so 4 more bombs are left to flag. So I need to find 4 more bombs.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0 is an empty square. It's adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (1,0) is a '1', which has a flag at (2,0). So (0,0) can't have a bomb. Maybe I can reveal it to see if it's a number or not.\n\nIf I reveal (0,0) and it's a '0', that would mean no bombs around it, but since (1,0) is a '1', it can't be '0'. So (0,0) must be a '1' or higher. But (1,0) is a '1', which already has a flag at (2,0), so (0,0) can't be a '1' because it would require another bomb, which isn't possible. Therefore, (0,0) must be safe, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 9, column 9, which is a '.'. It's adjacent to (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at row 5, column 0, which is a '.'. Its adjacent squares include (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1). (4,1) is a '1', which has a flag at (3,2). So (5,0) can't be a bomb because (4,1) is a '1' with a flag at (3,2), so no other bombs can be adjacent. Therefore, (5,0) is safe. Maybe I can reveal it.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, I can look for a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and can only have one possible bomb location.\n\nWait, looking at row 6, column 5 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). If I can find that only one of these squares can be a bomb, then I can flag it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 7, column 4 is a '2'. Its adjacent squares include (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). Not sure yet.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to find a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and can only have one possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). If I can determine that one of these must be a bomb, then I can flag it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 9, column 1 again. It's a '1' with a flag at (8,2). So the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. Therefore, (9,0) is safe. Maybe I can reveal (9,0) to see if it's a number.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a tile that is adjacent to multiple numbers, which can help me deduce a bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 3 is a '2'. Its adjacent squares include (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (8,2) is an 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, the '2' at (7,3) needs another bomb. So one of the other squares must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (6,2), which is a '.'; (6,3), which is a '.'; (6,4), which is a '.'; (7,2), which is a '2'; (7,4), which is a '2'; (8,3), which is a '.'; (8,4), which is a '.'.\n\nHmm, not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at row 4, column 1 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,2) is an 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, the '1' at (4,1) is satisfied, so no other bombs can be adjacent.\n\nSo, the other squares around (4,1) can't have bombs. Therefore, (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2) can't have bombs.\n\nThis might help in deducing other areas. For example, (5,0) can't have a bomb because it's adjacent to (4,1)'s '1', which already has a flag at (3,2).\n\nSo, (5,0) is safe. Maybe I can reveal it.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, I can look for a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and can only have one possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 5 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). If I can find that only one of these can be a bomb, then I can flag it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 3, column 4 is a '2'. Its adjacent squares include (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is an 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, the '2' at (3,4) needs another bomb. So one of the other squares must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (3,5), which is a '.'; (4,5), which is a '.'; (2,4), which is a '.'; (4,4), which is a '1'; (4,3), which is a '.'.\n\nNot sure yet.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should consider placing a flag where I'm certain there's a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 1 is a '2', which needs another bomb. Since (8,2) is already an 'F', maybe the other bomb is at (7,0) or (6,1). But (6,1) is a '1', which can't have another bomb because it's already satisfied by (8,2). Wait, no, (6,1) is a '1', which has a flag at (8,2), so it can't have another bomb. Therefore, the other bomb for (7,1)'s '2' must be at (7,0) or (6,0). But (6,0) is a '.'.\n\nWait, no, (7,1) is a '2', which has a flag at (8,2). So it needs another bomb. The possible squares are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1). But (6,1) is a '1', which already has a flag at (8,2), so it can't have another bomb. Therefore, the other bomb must be at (7,0), (6,0), (6,2), (7,2), (8,0), or (8,1).\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine which one. Maybe I can look for another number that could help.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 3 is a '2', which also needs another bomb. Its adjacent squares include (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (8,2) is an 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, the '2' at (7,3) needs another bomb. So one of the other squares must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (7,4), which is a '2', so it also needs another bomb. Its adjacent squares include (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). Not sure yet.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and can only have one possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). If I can determine that one of these must be a bomb, then I can flag it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 6, column 5 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). If I can find that one of these must be a bomb, then I can flag it.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at row 9, column 1 again. It's a '1' with a flag at (8,2). So the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. Therefore, (9,0) is safe. Maybe I can reveal (9,0).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, I can look for a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and can only have one possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 1 is a '1' with a flag at (3,2). So the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. Therefore, (5,0) is safe, as I thought earlier.\n\nMaybe I can reveal (5,0). If it's a '0', that would help me a lot. But if it's a number, it might give me more clues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 0, column 0. It's adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (1,0) is a '1' with a flag at (2,0). So (0,0) can't have a bomb. Therefore, (0,0) is safe. Maybe I can reveal it.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, I can look for a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and can only have one possible bomb location.\n\nWait, looking at row 7, column 4 is a '2'. Its adjacent squares include (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). If I can determine that one of these must be a bomb, then I can flag it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 5, column 4 again. Its adjacent squares include (4,3), which is a '.', (4,4), which is a '1', (4,5), which is a '.', (5,3), which is a '.', (5,5), which is a '.', (6,3), which is a '.', (6,4), which is a '.', (6,5), which is a '1'.\n\nWait, (4,4) is a '1', which has a flag at (3,2). So (4,4) is a '1' with a flag at (3,2). Therefore, the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. So (5,4) is adjacent to (4,4)'s '1', which already has a flag. Therefore, (5,4) can't have a bomb because it's adjacent to (4,4)'s '1', which already has a flag. Wait, no, (5,4) is a '1', so it's a separate tile. So (5,4) is a '1', which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. So the adjacent squares to (5,4) must include one bomb.\n\nSo, the adjacent squares to (5,4) are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,4) is a '1', which has a flag at (3,2). So (5,4) is a '1', which must have one bomb adjacent. So one of the other squares must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (6,5), which is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). If (6,5) is a '1', it must have one bomb adjacent. So one of these squares must be a bomb.\n\nBut (5,4) is a '1', which needs a bomb. So maybe (6,5) is the bomb for (5,4)'s '1'. Because (6,5) is a '1', which would require a bomb adjacent to it, but (6,5) itself could be a bomb. Wait, no, (6,5) is a '1', so it's a number, not a bomb. So the bomb must be adjacent to (6,5). So one of (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) must be a bomb.\n\nBut (5,4) is a '1', so it needs a bomb. So maybe (6,5) is adjacent to (5,4)'s bomb. So the bomb for (5,4)'s '1' could be at (6,5)'s adjacent squares.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should consider that I have 4 flags left, and I need to place them where I'm certain there are bombs.\n\nLooking back, I think the best approach is to look for a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and can only have one possible bomb location. For example, if a '1' has all adjacent squares revealed except one, then that one must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is a '1' with a flag at (0,9). So the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. Therefore, (0,7) is a '1', which must have a bomb adjacent. So (0,7) is a '1', which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,8) is a '1', which has a flag at (0,9). So (0,7) is a '1', which needs a bomb. So one of (0,6), (1,6), (1,7) must be a bomb.\n\nBut I don't know which one. Maybe I can look for other clues.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 1, column 8 is a '1' with a flag at (0,9). So the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. Therefore, (1,7) is a '.' and can't have a bomb because (1,8) is a '1' with a flag at (0,9). So (1,7) is safe.\n\nWait, no, (1,8) is a '1' with a flag at (0,9), so the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. So (1,7) is safe.\n\nTherefore, (0,7) is a '1', which needs a bomb. Its adjacent squares are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,8) is a '1', (1,8) is a '1', and (1,7) is safe. So the bomb must be at (0,6) or (1,6).\n\nLooking at (0,6), which is a '.'. Its adjacent squares include (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, (1,6) is a '.'. Its adjacent squares include (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). Not sure.\n\nI think I'm stuck again. Maybe I should consider placing a flag where I'm certain there's a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nWait, looking at row 3, column 4 is a '2' with a flag at (2,3). So it needs another bomb. The adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is an 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, the '2' at (3,4) needs another bomb. So one of the other squares must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (3,5), which is a '.'; (4,5), which is a '.'; (2,4), which is a '.'; (4,4), which is a '1'; (4,3), which is a '.'.\n\nNot sure yet.\n\nI think I've exhausted my options for now. Maybe I should reveal a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and can't be a bomb, or place a flag where I'm certain there's a bomb.\n\nWait, looking at row 9, column 1 is a '1' with a flag at (8,2). So the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. Therefore, (9,0) is safe. Maybe I can reveal (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can look for a tile that is adjacent to a '1' and can only have one possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). If I can determine that one of these must be a bomb, then I can flag it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 6, column 5 is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). If I can find that one of these must be a bomb, then I can flag it.\n\nI think I've considered most possibilities, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should take a guess and place a flag where I think there's a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nWait, looking at row 7, column 1 is a '2' with a flag at (8,2). So it needs another bomb. The possible squares are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1). But (6,1) is a '1', which can't have another bomb. So the other bomb must be at (7,0) or (6,0).\n\nLooking at (7,0), which is a '.'. Its adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1). (6,1) is a '1', which has a flag at (8,2). So (7,0) can't be a bomb because it's adjacent to (6,1)'s '1', which already has a flag. Wait, no, (7,0) is adjacent to (6,1), which is a '1' with a flag at (8,2). So (7,0) can't be a bomb because (6,1)'s '1' already has one bomb. Therefore, (7,0) can't be a bomb. So the other bomb for (7,1)'s '2' must be at (6,0).\n\nTherefore, (6,0) must be a bomb. So I can place a flag there.\n\nSo my next move would be to place a flag at (6,0).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (6,0) because it's the only possible location for a bomb adjacent to the '2' at (7,1), which already has one bomb at (8,2). All other adjacent squares to (7,1) cannot be bombs due to nearby '1's with existing flags.\n\nMOVE: 6,0,true", "flags_remaining": 4, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

Let me start by looking at the board and the game info provided.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 3 flags remaining, which means I can place up to 3 more flags if needed. My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without hitting any.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares are already revealed, some are flagged (marked with F), and others are still unexplored (marked with .). The numbers on the board indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that square. For example, the square at (0,8) is a 1, meaning there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares.\n\nI should start by checking all the revealed numbers against the existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. If a number shows '1' but there are already two flags around it, that's a problem because the number indicates exactly one bomb. Similarly, if a '2' has only one flag nearby, there must be another bomb adjacent.\n\nLet me go through each revealed number one by one.\n\nStarting with row 0: At (0,8), it's a 1. The surrounding squares are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), and (1,8). (0,9) is unexplored, (0,7) is a 1, (1,7) is unexplored, and (1,8) is a 1. Wait, actually, (0,8) is a 1, so it has exactly one bomb around it. But looking at the surrounding squares, I don't see any flags yet, so that's okay.\n\nNext, row 1: (1,0) is a 1, (1,1) is a 1, (1,2) is a 2, (1,8) is a 1, and (1,9) is unexplored. Let's check (1,2) which is a 2. The surrounding squares include (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). From the board, (0,1) is 1, (0,2) is unexplored, (0,3) is unexplored, (1,1) is 1, (1,3) is unexplored, (2,1) is F, (2,2) is unexplored, and (2,3) is F. So, there are two flags at (2,1) and (2,3). But the number is 2, so if both those flags are correct, that's two bombs, which matches the number. So that's okay.\n\nRow 2: (2,0) is F, (2,4) is 1, (2,7) is 1, (2,8) is 2. Let's check (2,4) as a 1. The surrounding squares would be (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). From the board, (2,3) is F, so that's one bomb. So the number 1 is satisfied because there's exactly one bomb adjacent. So that's okay.\n\n(2,7) is a 1. Surrounding squares: (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). From the board, (1,8) is 1, (2,8) is 2, (3,7) is unexplored, (3,8) is 1. I don't see any flags around (2,7), so that's fine.\n\n(2,8) is a 2. The surrounding squares include (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). (1,8) is 1, (2,7) is 1, (3,8) is 1. I don't see any flags here, so that's okay.\n\nMoving on to row 3: (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 2, (3,3) is F, (3,4) is 1, (3,8) is 1. Let's check (3,1) which is a 2. The surrounding squares are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) is F, (2,1) is F. So that's two flags, which matches the number 2. So that's okay.\n\n(3,4) is a 1. Surrounding squares: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is F, so that's one bomb. So the number 1 is satisfied.\n\n(3,8) is a 1. Surrounding squares: (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). I don't see any flags here, so that's okay.\n\nRow 4: (4,1) is 1, (4,3) is 1, (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is 2. Let's check (4,8) which is a 2. Surrounding squares: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). I don't see any flags here, so that's okay.\n\nRow 5: (5,1) is 1, (5,2) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is 1, (5,7) is 2. Let's check (5,7) which is a 2. Surrounding squares: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). I don't see any flags here, so that's okay.\n\nRow 6: (6,0) is F, (6,5) is 1, (6,8) is F. Let's check (6,5) which is a 1. Surrounding squares: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). I don't see any flags here, so that's okay.\n\nRow 7: (7,1) is 1, (7,2) is 2, (7,3) is 2, (7,5) is 1, (7,6) is 1. Let's check (7,2) which is a 2. Surrounding squares: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (6,1) is unexplored, (6,2) is unexplored, (6,3) is unexplored, (7,1) is 1, (7,3) is 2, (8,1) is 1, (8,2) is unexplored, (8,3) is F. So there's a flag at (8,3). So the number 2 requires exactly two bombs. So if (8,3) is a bomb, there must be another bomb adjacent. Let's see: (7,3) is a 2, so maybe that's where the other bomb is, but (7,3) is a number, not a flag. Wait, no, (7,3) is a 2, which means it has two bombs around it. So perhaps the other bomb is somewhere else around (7,2). Maybe (6,3) or (8,2), but I can't tell yet.\n\n(7,3) is a 2. Surrounding squares: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (8,3) is F, so that's one bomb. So the number 2 requires another bomb. So perhaps (6,3) or (7,4) or (8,2) or (8,4). But I don't have enough info yet.\n\nRow 8: (8,2) is F, (8,3) is F. So two flags here. Since the total bombs are 10, and I have 3 flags remaining, I need to make sure I don't place flags where the numbers don't allow it.\n\nRow 9: (9,1) is 1, (9,2) is unexplored, etc. Not much info here.\n\nNow, considering the critical flag placement rules, I need to make sure that any new flag I place doesn't conflict with the numbers. Also, before placing a flag, I should check if it's possible that the square is a bomb based on the surrounding numbers.\n\nLooking at the board, I have some squares that are unexplored but adjacent to numbers. For example, (0,9) is unexplored, and (0,8) is a 1. Since (0,8) is a 1, and (0,9) is adjacent, if (0,8)'s 1 is already accounted for by another bomb, then (0,9) might be safe. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, (6,0) is F, so that's one bomb. (6,8) is F, so that's another. So two flags there, but the total bombs are 10, and I have 3 flags left. So I can place up to 3 more flags, but I have to be careful.\n\nWait, actually, the total bombs are 10, and the number of flags placed so far: let me count the F's.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: (0,8) is 1, but (0,9) is F? Wait no, (0,9) is unexplored. Wait, looking back, the initial board shows:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\nSo (0,9) is F. So that's one flag.\n\nRow 2: (2,0) is F, (2,3) is F.\n\nRow 6: (6,0) is F, (6,8) is F.\n\nRow 8: (8,2) is F, (8,3) is F.\n\nSo that's a total of 1 (row0) + 2 (row2) + 2 (row6) + 2 (row8) = 7 flags. But the game info says flags remaining: 3. So total flags placed are 10 - 3 = 7. So that matches.\n\nSo I can place 3 more flags if needed.\n\nNow, looking for possible places to flag. Let's see where the numbers indicate that a bomb must be.\n\nFor example, looking at (7,2) which is a 2, and (8,3) is F. So (7,2) needs another bomb adjacent. The possible squares are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (8,3) is already F, so the other bomb must be in one of the other squares.\n\nLooking at (7,1) which is a 1. It's adjacent to (6,0) which is F, so that's one bomb. So (7,1) can't have any other bombs adjacent. Therefore, the other bomb for (7,2) must be in (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2). But (8,2) is F, so that's another bomb. Wait, (8,2) is F, so that's two bombs: (8,3) and (8,2). So does that satisfy the 2 for (7,2)? Let me see: (7,2) is adjacent to (8,2) and (8,3), both F. So that's two bombs, which matches the number 2. So (7,2) is okay.\n\nWait, but (7,2) is a 2, so it needs exactly two bombs adjacent. Since (8,2) and (8,3) are both F, that's two bombs, so that's correct. So that's okay.\n\nLooking elsewhere, maybe at (5,7) which is a 2. The surrounding squares are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (6,8) is F, so that's one bomb. So the other bomb must be in one of the other squares. Let's see: (5,6) is 1, so it can't have more than one bomb adjacent. Wait, (5,6) is a 1, so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (5,6) include (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (5,7) is a 2, which we're considering, and (6,5) is 1. So if (5,6) is a 1, it must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. Since (5,7) is a 2, which is a number, not a flag, and (6,5) is 1, which is also a number. So maybe the bomb is at (4,6) or (4,7) or (6,6) or (6,7). But I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (0,9) which is F. The surrounding squares are (0,8), which is 1, and (1,8), which is 1, and (1,9), which is unexplored. So (0,9) is F, which is a bomb. That would satisfy the 1 at (0,8) because (0,9) is a bomb adjacent to it. So that's okay.\n\nWait, (0,8) is a 1, so it has exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (0,9) is F, that's the one bomb. So that's correct.\n\nLooking at (2,0) which is F. The surrounding squares are (1,0), which is 1, and (1,1), which is 1, and (2,1), which is F, and (3,0), which is 1, and (3,1), which is 2. So (2,0) is F, which is a bomb. That would satisfy the 1 at (1,0) because it's adjacent. Also, (3,0) is a 1, which would be satisfied by (2,0). So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is F. The surrounding squares include (1,2) which is 2, (1,3) which is unexplored, (2,2) which is unexplored, (2,4) which is 1, (3,2) which is unexplored, (3,3) which is F. So (2,3) is F, which is a bomb. That would satisfy the 2 at (1,2) because there's another F at (2,1) and (2,3). Wait, (1,2) is a 2, and the surrounding squares include (2,1) F and (2,3) F, which makes two bombs, so that's correct.\n\nSo far, all the existing flags seem to be correctly placed based on the numbers.\n\nNow, considering the remaining flags, I have 3 left. I need to find where to place them without conflicting with the numbers.\n\nLooking at (6,8) which is F. The surrounding squares include (5,7), which is 2, (5,8), which is unexplored, (6,7), which is unexplored, (7,7), which is unexplored, (7,8), which is unexplored, (7,9), which is unexplored, and (6,9), which is unexplored. So (6,8) is F, which is a bomb. That would satisfy the 2 at (5,7) because there's another bomb needed. But I don't know where that other bomb is yet.\n\nAnother approach: look for squares that are unexplored but are adjacent to numbers that might indicate a bomb must be there.\n\nFor example, looking at (9,1) which is a 1. The surrounding squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,0), (10,1), (10,2). Wait, but the board is 10x10, so x goes up to 9. So (8,0) is unexplored, (8,1) is 1, (8,2) is F, (9,0) is unexplored, (9,2) is unexplored. So (9,1) is a 1, so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (8,2) is F, that's the one bomb, so the rest must be safe. Therefore, (9,0), (9,2), (8,0), (8,1), etc., must be safe. So maybe I can reveal some of these squares safely.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, making it a likely candidate for a bomb.\n\nLooking at (8,3) which is F. The surrounding squares include (7,2), which is 2, (7,3), which is 2, (7,4), which is unexplored, (8,2), which is F, (8,4), which is unexplored, (9,2), which is unexplored, (9,3), which is unexplored, (9,4), which is unexplored. So (8,3) is F, which is a bomb, satisfying the 2 at (7,2) and (7,3).\n\nWait, (7,3) is a 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. One is (8,3) F, and the other must be somewhere else. Let's see: (7,3) is adjacent to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (8,3) is F, and (8,2) is F. So that's two bombs, which satisfies the 2 at (7,3). So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking for a square that must be a bomb because the numbers require it. For example, if a square is the only possible spot for a bomb based on the surrounding numbers.\n\nLooking at (5,7) which is a 2. The surrounding squares include (6,8) F, so that's one bomb. The other bomb must be in one of the other squares. Let's see: (5,6) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (5,6) are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (5,7) is a 2, which is a number, not a bomb, so the bomb must be elsewhere. Wait, no, (5,7) is a number, so it indicates two bombs around it. Since (6,8) is F, the other bomb must be in another square adjacent to (5,7).\n\nLooking at (5,7)'s adjacent squares: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (6,8) is F, so the other bomb must be in one of the other squares. Let's see which of these could be a bomb without conflicting with other numbers.\n\n(4,8) is a 2, so it needs two bombs. Let's check (4,8): surrounding squares include (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (5,7) is a 2, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (3,8) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. (3,8) is adjacent to (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). (2,8) is a 2, which is a number, so not a bomb. So if (4,8) is a 2, it needs two bombs. Let's see: (5,7) is a number, so not a bomb. (3,7) is unexplored, (3,8) is a 1, which already has (2,8) as a number, but (2,8) is a 2, not a bomb. Wait, no, (2,8) is a 2, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. So (3,8) is a 1, which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. So the bomb must be in one of the surrounding squares. Let's see: (2,7) is a 1, (2,8) is a 2, (3,7) is unexplored, (4,7) is unexplored, (4,8) is a 2, (4,9) is unexplored, (3,9) is unexplored. So (3,8) needs exactly one bomb. If (4,8) is a bomb, that would satisfy (3,8)'s 1. But (4,8) is a 2, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. Wait, no, (4,8) is a number, so it's not a bomb. So the bomb must be somewhere else around (3,8). Maybe (3,7) or (4,7) or (4,9). But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1, which would indicate that it must be a bomb or not.\n\nLooking at (0,9) which is F, as I thought earlier. It's adjacent to (0,8) which is a 1, so that's correct.\n\nLooking at (6,0) which is F. It's adjacent to (5,0), which is unexplored, and (7,0), which is unexplored. But (6,0) is F, so that's a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, making it a likely candidate for a bomb.\n\nLooking at (8,3) which is F. It's adjacent to (7,2) which is a 2 and (7,3) which is a 2. So that's correct.\n\nAnother approach: look for a square that is the only possible spot for a bomb based on the surrounding numbers.\n\nFor example, looking at (5,7) which is a 2, and (6,8) is F. So the other bomb must be in one of the remaining adjacent squares. Let's see: (5,7) is adjacent to (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (6,8) is F, so the other bomb must be in one of the other squares.\n\nLooking at (5,6) which is a 1. It's adjacent to (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (5,7) is a 2, which is a number, so not a bomb. So the bomb must be in one of the other squares. But (5,6) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If I place a flag on (4,7), would that satisfy both (5,7) and (5,6)?\n\nWait, (5,7) needs two bombs, one is (6,8), the other could be (4,7). If (4,7) is a bomb, then (5,6) would have (4,7) as a bomb, which would satisfy its 1. That could work.\n\nBut I don't know if (4,7) is a bomb yet. Alternatively, maybe (6,7) is the bomb. Let me check.\n\nIf I consider (6,7) as a bomb, then (5,7) would have two bombs: (6,8) and (6,7). That would satisfy the 2. Also, (6,7) is adjacent to (6,6), which is unexplored, and (6,5) which is a 1. So (6,5) is a 1, which would have (6,7) as a bomb adjacent, satisfying its 1. That seems possible.\n\nSo maybe (6,7) is a bomb. But I can't be sure yet. Alternatively, (4,7) could be a bomb, which would satisfy both (5,7) and (5,6).\n\nBut without more info, it's hard to tell. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at (3,3) which is F. It's adjacent to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (3,3) is F, which is a bomb. That would satisfy (2,4) which is a 1, as (3,3) is adjacent. Also, (3,4) is a 1, which would be satisfied by (3,3). So that's correct.\n\nAnother idea: look for a square that is surrounded by numbers that require it to be a bomb. For example, if a square is adjacent to two 1s, and those 1s can't be satisfied otherwise, then that square must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (5,7) again. If (5,7) is a 2, and (6,8) is F, then the other bomb must be in one of the adjacent squares. Let's see which of those could be a bomb without conflicting other numbers.\n\nIf I consider (5,8) as a bomb, then (5,7) would have (6,8) and (5,8) as bombs, satisfying the 2. Also, (5,8) is adjacent to (5,9), which is unexplored, and (4,8), which is a 2. So (4,8) is a 2, which would have (5,8) as a bomb, but it needs another bomb. So maybe (4,7) is also a bomb. But then (5,6) is a 1, which would have (4,7) as a bomb, satisfying its 1. That could work.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Maybe I should instead look for a square that is the only possible spot for a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at (7,3) which is a 2, and it's adjacent to (8,3) F and (8,2) F. So that's two bombs, which satisfies the 2. So that's correct.\n\nLooking at (5,5) which is a 1. The surrounding squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (5,5) is a 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. Let's see: (6,5) is a 1, which is a number, so not a bomb. (4,5) is unexplored, (4,6) is unexplored, (5,4) is unexplored, (5,6) is a 1, (6,4) is unexplored, (6,6) is unexplored. So the bomb must be in one of these squares. But without more info, I can't tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb location.\n\nFor example, (9,1) is a 1. It's adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,2) is F, so that's the one bomb. Therefore, (9,1) is satisfied, and the other adjacent squares must be safe. So (9,0), (9,2), (8,0), (8,1) must be safe. So maybe I can reveal (9,0) safely.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, maybe I can flag a square that is likely to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at (6,7), which is adjacent to (5,7) which is a 2 and (6,5) which is a 1. If (6,7) is a bomb, then (5,7) would have (6,8) and (6,7) as bombs, satisfying the 2. Also, (6,5) would have (6,7) as a bomb, satisfying its 1. So that seems possible.\n\nBut I don't know for sure. Maybe I can check if placing a flag at (6,7) would conflict with any numbers.\n\nIf I place a flag at (6,7), then (5,7) would have two bombs: (6,8) and (6,7). That's correct. Also, (6,5) would have (6,7) as a bomb, satisfying its 1. So that seems okay.\n\nBut I only have 3 flags left, and I don't want to waste them. Alternatively, maybe I can reveal a square that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at (9,0), which is adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), and (9,1). (8,1) is a 1, which is satisfied by (8,2) F. So (9,0) is adjacent to (8,0) and (9,1). If (8,0) is safe, then (9,0) is safe. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (0,0), which is unexplored. It's adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (1,0) is a 1, which is satisfied by (2,0) F. So (0,0) is adjacent to (1,0) which is a 1, but (2,0) is F, so (0,0) is safe because it's not adjacent to any other bombs. Wait, no, (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1), which is unexplored, and (1,0), which is a 1. Since (1,0) is a 1 and has (2,0) F as its only bomb, then (0,0) is safe because it's not adjacent to any other bombs. So I can safely reveal (0,0).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb.\n\nWait, (0,1) is unexplored and adjacent to (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (1,0) is a 1, which is satisfied by (2,0) F. So (0,1) is adjacent to (1,0) which is a 1, but (2,0) is the bomb. So (0,1) is safe because it's not adjacent to any other bombs. So I can reveal (0,1) safely.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure if that's the best move. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 2 and is the only possible bomb location.\n\nLooking back at (5,7) which is a 2, and (6,8) is F. The other bomb must be in (4,7), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), or (6,7). If I consider (5,8) as a bomb, then (5,7) would have two bombs, satisfying the 2. Also, (5,8) is adjacent to (4,8) which is a 2, so that would require another bomb. So (4,8) is a 2, so it needs two bombs. If (5,8) is a bomb, then the other bomb must be in one of (4,7), (3,8), or (4,9). But I don't know.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb.\n\nLooking at (3,4) which is a 1. It's adjacent to (2,3) F, so that's the one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares must be safe. So (3,4) is satisfied, and the surrounding squares like (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) must be safe. So maybe I can reveal some of these.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (4,8) which is a 2. It's adjacent to (5,7) which is a 2, and (6,8) which is F. So (4,8) needs two bombs. One is (6,8) F, the other must be in (5,7) or elsewhere. But (5,7) is a number, not a bomb, so the other bomb must be in (3,7), (4,7), (5,8), etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think the safest move is to reveal a square that is definitely safe based on the numbers. For example, (0,0) is safe because it's adjacent to (1,0) which is a 1, and the only bomb is (2,0) F. So (0,0) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, (9,0) is adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), and (9,1). (8,1) is a 1, which is satisfied by (8,2) F. So (9,0) is safe because it's not adjacent to any other bombs.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is adjacent to a 2 and must be a bomb.\n\nWait, looking at (5,7) again, which is a 2. If I place a flag at (5,8), that would satisfy (5,7)'s 2 with (6,8) and (5,8). Then, (5,8) would also satisfy (4,8)'s 2, needing another bomb. So maybe (4,8) is a bomb, but (4,8) is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Wait, no, (4,8) is a number, so it's not a bomb. So the other bomb must be in another square adjacent to (4,8). Maybe (4,7) or (3,8). But (3,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (2,8) F. So (4,7) could be a bomb, which would satisfy both (5,7) and (4,8). But I don't know.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should just reveal a square that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at (0,0): adjacent to (1,0) which is a 1, and the only bomb is (2,0) F. So (0,0) is safe. So I can reveal (0,0) without any problem.\n\nAlternatively, (9,0) is safe because it's adjacent to (8,1) which is a 1, satisfied by (8,2) F. So (9,0) is safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure which one to choose. Maybe I'll go with (0,0) because it's in the corner and less likely to be a bomb.\n\nSo my move would be to reveal (0,0), which is safe.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (0,0) as it's adjacent to a 1 at (1,0) which is already satisfied by a flag at (2,0), making (0,0) safe.\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 1, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the information given. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 3 flags remaining, which means I can place up to 3 more flags if needed. \n\nFirst, I should check all the revealed numbers against the existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. I remember that each number must exactly match the number of adjacent bombs. If a '1' has two flags next to it, that's a conflict because it can only have one bomb nearby. Similarly, a '2' with only one flag must have another bomb somewhere else around it.\n\nLooking at the board, let's go row by row. \n\nStarting with row 0: It has some revealed numbers and a flag at (0,8). The first few cells are empty, then at (0,8) it's a flag, and then (0,9) is unexplored. Since (0,8) is a flag, I should check if any adjacent numbers are affected. For example, the cell at (0,7) is 1, which means it has exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (0,8) is a flag, that accounts for the '1' at (0,7), so that seems okay.\n\nMoving to row 1: There are several 1s and 2s. At (1,0) it's 1, (1,1) is 1, (1,2) is 2, and so on. The cell (1,8) is 1, and (1,9) is unexplored. I should check if any of these numbers have conflicting flags nearby. For instance, the 2 at (1,2) should have exactly two bombs around it. If there are already two flags nearby, that would be a problem, but looking around (1,2), I don't see any flags adjacent yet, so that's fine.\n\nRow 2: There's an F at (2,0) and (2,3). The cell (2,4) is 1, and (2,7) is 1. Let's check the 1s. The 1 at (2,4) should have exactly one bomb adjacent. It's next to (2,3) which is a flag, so that's accounted for. Similarly, (2,7) is 1, and it's next to (2,8) which is 2, but (2,8) is a number, not a flag. Wait, no, (2,8) is 2, so that's a number indicating two bombs nearby, not a flag. So the 1 at (2,7) has to have one bomb adjacent, which could be somewhere else.\n\nRow 3: Starts with 1, then 2, then F at (3,2), and so on. The 2 at (3,1) should have two bombs nearby. There's a flag at (3,2), so that's one. So there must be another bomb adjacent to (3,1). Let me see where that could be. Maybe (2,1) or (3,0), but (3,0) is 1, which is a number, not a bomb. Hmm, so perhaps (4,1) or (3,3)? Not sure yet.\n\nRow 4: The cell (4,1) is 1, (4,3) is 1, and (4,6) is 1. Each of these should have exactly one bomb nearby. Let's check (4,1): it's adjacent to (3,1) which is 2, but that's a number, not a flag. So maybe there's a flag or a bomb near (4,1). Wait, (3,2) is a flag, which is adjacent to (4,1). So that's the one bomb for (4,1). That makes sense.\n\nRow 5: (5,1) is 1, (5,2) is 1, (5,3) is 1, and (5,5) is 1. Let's check (5,1): adjacent to (4,1) which is 1, but that's a number. So the bomb for (5,1) must be somewhere else, maybe (5,0) or (4,0) or (6,1). Similarly, (5,2) is 1, so it must have a bomb adjacent. The same goes for (5,3).\n\nRow 6: (6,0) is F, (6,5) is 1, (6,7) is F, and (6,9) is unexplored. The 1 at (6,5) must have one bomb adjacent. It's next to (6,4), which is unexplored, (5,5) which is 1, and (7,5) which is 1. So the bomb for (6,5) could be at (6,4) or (5,4) or (7,4), etc.\n\nRow 7: (7,1) is 2, (7,2) is 2, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is 1, (7,5) is 1. Let's look at (7,1): it's 2, so two bombs nearby. It's adjacent to (6,1), which is unexplored, (7,0) unexplored, (7,2) which is 2, and (8,1) which is 1. So maybe (6,1) and (7,0) are bombs? Or perhaps (8,1) is a bomb, but (8,1) is 1, so that can't be. Wait, (8,1) is 1, so it has exactly one bomb adjacent. So if (8,1) is 1, then the bomb must be near it, perhaps (7,1) or (8,0) or (8,2) or (9,1). But (7,1) is 2, which is a number, not a bomb.\n\nRow 8: (8,1) is 1, (8,2) is F. So the 1 at (8,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The flag at (8,2) is a bomb, so that accounts for it. So (8,1) is satisfied because it's next to a flag.\n\nRow 9: (9,1) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. It's next to (8,1) which is 1, so the bomb must be somewhere else, maybe (9,0), (9,2), or (8,0).\n\nNow, looking at the flags remaining: I have 3 flags left. There are 10 bombs in total, and I've already placed some flags. Let me count the flags on the board:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: (0,8) is F.\n\nRow 2: (2,0) and (2,3) are F.\n\nRow 6: (6,0) and (6,7) are F.\n\nRow 8: (8,2) is F.\n\nSo that's 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 flags placed. Since the total bombs are 10, and I have 3 flags left, I can place 3 more flags. But I need to make sure that placing a flag doesn't conflict with any numbers.\n\nNow, let's look for obvious conflicts. For example, a '1' that already has a flag adjacent can't have another. Or a '2' that has two flags adjacent would be a conflict.\n\nLooking at (0,7) which is 1. It's adjacent to (0,8) which is a flag, so that's okay. No conflict there.\n\nLooking at (1,8) which is 1. It's adjacent to (1,9) which is unexplored, and (0,8) which is a flag. So if (1,8) is 1, it can't have another bomb adjacent. So if I place a flag at (1,9), that would make two flags adjacent to (1,8), which is a conflict. So I can't place a flag at (1,9) because (1,8) is 1.\n\nSimilarly, let's check other numbers. For example, (2,4) is 1, and it's adjacent to (2,3) which is a flag. So that's okay. (2,7) is 1, adjacent to (2,8) which is 2. So (2,7) needs one bomb, which could be (3,7) or (2,6) or (1,7). But (2,8) is 2, which is a number, so it's okay.\n\nLooking at (3,1) which is 2. It's adjacent to (3,2) which is a flag, so that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb adjacent to (3,1). Let's see where that could be. The adjacent cells are (2,1), (4,1), (3,0), and (3,2). (3,2) is a flag, so that's one. The other could be (2,1) or (4,1). (4,1) is 1, so it can't have a bomb because it's a number. Wait, no, (4,1) is 1, meaning it has exactly one bomb adjacent. So if (4,1) is 1, and (3,1) is 2, then (3,1) needs another bomb. So the bomb could be at (2,1) or (4,0) or (4,2). But (4,2) is unexplored. Hmm, maybe (2,1) is a bomb.\n\nWait, (2,1) is unexplored. If I flag (2,1), that would satisfy both (3,1)'s 2 and (4,1)'s 1. Because (4,1) is 1 and adjacent to (3,1) which is 2, but (4,1) needs only one bomb. Wait, no, (4,1) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. If (3,1) is 2, it needs two bombs. So if I place a flag at (2,1), then (3,1) would have two flags adjacent: (3,2) and (2,1). But (3,1) is 2, so that's okay. However, (4,1) is 1, and if (2,1) is a flag, then (4,1) is adjacent to (3,1) which is 2, but (4,1) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb. So if (2,1) is a flag, that would be the one bomb for (4,1). So that seems okay.\n\nBut before placing a flag, I need to make sure that it doesn't conflict with any numbers. Let me check the numbers around (2,1). The cells around (2,1) are:\n\n- (1,0): 1\n- (1,1): 1\n- (1,2): 2\n- (2,0): F\n- (2,2): unexplored\n- (3,0): 1\n- (3,1): 2\n- (3,2): F\n\nSo if I place a flag at (2,1), let's see the impact on the adjacent numbers.\n\n(1,0) is 1: it's adjacent to (0,0), which is unexplored, (1,1) which is 1, and (2,0) which is a flag. So (1,0) is 1, and it's adjacent to (2,0) which is a flag, so that's okay. Placing a flag at (2,1) would not affect (1,0) because it's already satisfied.\n\n(1,1) is 1: it's adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). If (2,1) is a flag, then (1,1) is 1, which is okay because it's adjacent to (2,1). So that's fine.\n\n(1,2) is 2: it's adjacent to (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2). If (2,1) is a flag, does that affect (1,2)? (1,2) is 2, so it needs two bombs. If (2,1) is a flag, that's one. It might have another from (2,2) or (1,3). But (1,3) is 2, so it's a number. So (1,2) would have one flag and potentially another bomb elsewhere, which is okay.\n\n(3,0) is 1: it's adjacent to (2,0) which is a flag, and (3,1) which is 2. So placing a flag at (2,1) doesn't affect (3,0) because it's already satisfied by (2,0).\n\nSo placing a flag at (2,1) seems okay. It satisfies (3,1)'s 2 and (4,1)'s 1. Let me check if any other numbers would be affected. \n\nWait, (2,1) is adjacent to (2,2), which is unexplored. If I flag (2,1), then (2,2) is adjacent to a flag, which is okay unless (2,2) is a number. But (2,2) is unexplored, so it's fine.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that I have 3 flags left. If I place one at (2,1), that leaves me with 2 more. But I need to make sure that I don't place a flag where a number is expecting a certain count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better move. Let me check other areas.\n\nLooking at row 5, cell (5,5) is 1. It's adjacent to (5,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,5). (6,5) is 1, so that's a number. So (5,5) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. If I can find where that bomb is, maybe I can flag it.\n\nBut without revealing, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal a cell that's likely to be safe based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at (9,1), which is 1. It's adjacent to (8,1) which is 1, and (9,0), (9,2), (8,0), (8,2). (8,2) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So (9,1) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (8,2) is a flag, that's the one. So (9,1) is okay.\n\nLooking at (0,0), it's unexplored. It's adjacent to (0,1), which is unexplored, and (1,0) which is 1, and (1,1) which is 1. So (0,0) is surrounded by numbers. Maybe it's safe to reveal, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (0,9), which is unexplored. It's adjacent to (0,8) which is a flag, and (1,9) which is unexplored. So (0,9) could be a bomb or safe. But since (0,8) is a flag, (0,7) is 1, which is satisfied by the flag at (0,8). So (0,9) could be safe, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to look for cells that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which might help narrow down where the bombs are.\n\nFor example, cell (5,5) is 1, adjacent to (6,5) which is 1. So both (5,5) and (6,5) are 1. That means each has exactly one bomb adjacent. If they are adjacent to each other, maybe they share a common bomb. So the bomb could be at (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), or (6,6). But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at (7,1) which is 2. It's adjacent to (6,1), (7,0), (7,2), and (8,1). (8,1) is 1, which is satisfied by the flag at (8,2). So (7,1) is 2, so it needs two bombs. One could be at (6,1) and another at (7,0) or (7,2). But (7,2) is 2 as well, so maybe (7,0) is a bomb and (7,2) is a number that needs two bombs, one of which is (7,0). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, (7,2) is 2. It's adjacent to (6,2), (7,1), (7,3), (8,2). (8,2) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So (7,2) needs another bomb, which could be at (6,2), (7,1), or (7,3). But (7,1) is 2, which is a number, not a bomb. So the other bomb must be at (6,2) or (7,3). \n\nSimilarly, (7,3) is 2. It's adjacent to (6,3), (7,2), (7,4), (8,3). (7,4) is 1, so it needs one bomb. If (7,3) is 2, it needs two bombs. So maybe (6,3) and (8,3) are bombs? Or (7,2) and (7,4). But (7,2) is 2, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So perhaps (6,3) and (8,3) are bombs.\n\nWait, (6,3) is unexplored. If I could flag it, that would help, but I need to check if it's possible without conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a cell that's adjacent to multiple numbers to get more info. For example, revealing (5,5) could help because it's adjacent to (5,4), (5,6), (6,5), etc. But I'm not sure if it's safe.\n\nAnother idea: let's count the number of bombs placed so far. There are 6 flags, so 6 bombs are already flagged. Since there are 10 bombs, there are 4 left. But I have 3 flags remaining, so I can flag 3 more. But I also need to consider that some bombs might still be unflagged and hidden under unexplored cells.\n\nWait, no. Each flag represents a bomb, so if I have 6 flags, that means 6 bombs are already accounted for. So there are 4 bombs left to be either flagged or revealed. But since the goal is to flag all bombs or reveal all safe cells, I need to be careful.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on areas where numbers can help me deduce where the bombs are.\n\nLooking back at (3,1) which is 2, and it's adjacent to (3,2) which is a flag. So it needs one more bomb. The possible cells are (2,1), (4,1), (3,0). (4,1) is 1, so it can't have a bomb because it's a number. So the bomb must be at (2,1) or (3,0). \n\nIf I place a flag at (2,1), that would satisfy both (3,1)'s 2 and (4,1)'s 1. Let me check if placing a flag at (2,1) would cause any conflicts with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (2,1)'s adjacent cells:\n\n- (1,0): 1\n- (1,1): 1\n- (1,2): 2\n- (2,0): F\n- (2,2): unexplored\n- (3,0): 1\n- (3,1): 2\n- (3,2): F\n\nPlacing a flag at (2,1) would mean that (1,1) is 1 and is adjacent to a flag, which is okay. (1,2) is 2, which would have one flag at (2,1), so it needs another bomb elsewhere, which is possible. (3,0) is 1 and adjacent to (2,0) which is a flag, so that's okay.\n\nSo placing a flag at (2,1) seems safe and would help satisfy the numbers around it. It uses one of my remaining flags, leaving me with 2 more.\n\nTherefore, my next move would be to place a flag at (2,1).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (2,1) satisfies the '2' at (3,1) by providing the second bomb and also satisfies the '1' at (4,1) by being the single adjacent bomb. This move doesn't conflict with any other revealed numbers and uses one of the remaining flags effectively.\n\nMOVE: 2,1,true", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 8, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the game info provided. \n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 2 flags remaining, so I can place two more flags if needed. My goal is to either reveal all the safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs without hitting a bomb when revealing. \n\nLooking at the board state, I see several revealed numbers and some flagged squares. I need to analyze the numbers and the surrounding squares to see where I can place a flag or reveal a tile without causing a conflict.\n\nStarting with the top row (row 0), I see that at (0,8) there's a 1, and (0,9) is flagged as F. Since the number 1 indicates exactly one bomb in the adjacent squares, and (0,9) is already flagged, that means the other adjacent squares around (0,8) shouldn't have any bombs. So I can check the squares around (0,8) to see if they're safe. The adjacent squares would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). But (0,7) is a 1, so that's already revealed, and (1,9) is a . (unexplored). Hmm, but since (0,8) is a 1 and (0,9) is flagged, maybe that's okay. I don't see an immediate conflict here.\n\nMoving down to row 1, I see three 1s in columns 0,1,2 and a 2 at (1,3). Then at (1,8) it's a 1, and (1,9) is a . So maybe I can look around the 2 at (1,3). The 2 means there are exactly two bombs adjacent to it. Let's see which squares are around it. The adjacent squares would be (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). \n\nLooking at these, (0,2) is a _, which is a revealed empty space, so no bomb there. (0,3) is a _, also empty. (0,4) is a ., unexplored. (1,2) is a 1, which is a number. (1,4) is a 1. (2,2) is a F, so that's a flagged square. (2,3) is a F. (2,4) is a 1. \n\nSo around (1,3), the 2 is indicating two bombs. We already have two flags at (2,2) and (2,3). Wait, that's two bombs right there. But (1,3) is a 2, so that's exactly two bombs. So that seems correct. So maybe that's okay.\n\nLooking at row 2, there are two Fs at (2,0) and (2,1), and a 1 at (2,4). Also, (2,5) is a ., (2,6) is a ., (2,7) is a 1, (2,8) is a 2, and (2,9) is a .. So maybe the 2 at (2,8) is interesting. It's a 2, so two bombs around it. The adjacent squares would be (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). \n\nLooking at these, (1,7) is a ., (1,8) is a 1, (1,9) is a .. (2,7) is a 1, (2,9) is a .. (3,7) is a ., (3,8) is a 1, (3,9) is a .. So, how many bombs are around (2,8)? We don't have any flags in these squares except maybe (3,8) is a 1, but that's a number, not a flag. So the two bombs must be somewhere else. Hmm, maybe I should check other areas.\n\nLooking at row 3, there's a 1 at (3,0), a 2 at (3,2), and a 1 at (3,4). Then (3,5) is a ., (3,6) is a ., (3,7) is a ., (3,8) is a 1, and (3,9) is a .. The 2 at (3,2) indicates two bombs around it. Let's see the adjacent squares: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). \n\n(2,1) is F, so that's one bomb. (2,2) is F, that's another bomb. So that's two bombs, which matches the 2 at (3,2). So that's correct. \n\nMoving to row 4, I see a 1 at (4,1), a 2 at (4,4), and a 2 at (4,7). Let's check the 2 at (4,4). Adjacent squares would be (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). \n\nLooking at these, (3,3) is a ., (3,4) is a 1, (3,5) is a .. (4,3) is a ., (4,5) is a .. (5,3) is a 1, (5,4) is a ., (5,5) is a 1. So I don't see any flags around here. So the two bombs must be somewhere in these squares. Maybe I can check if any of these are likely to be bombs based on other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 5, there's a 1 at (5,1), a 1 at (5,2), a 1 at (5,3), a 1 at (5,5), (5,6) is a 1, and (5,7) is a 2. The 2 at (5,7) indicates two bombs around it. Let's see the adjacent squares: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). \n\n(4,6) is a ., (4,7) is a 2, (4,8) is a 1. (5,6) is a 1, (5,8) is a ., (6,6) is a ., (6,7) is a F, (6,8) is a .. So, the two bombs around (5,7) must be somewhere here. I see that (6,7) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb adjacent. Maybe (4,6) or (5,8) or (6,6) or (6,8). \n\nLooking at row 6, there's an F at (6,0), (6,1) is a ., (6,2) is a ., (6,3) is a ., (6,4) is a ., (6,5) is a 1, (6,6) is a ., (6,7) is F, (6,8) is a ., and (6,9) is a .. So two Fs here. That's two bombs. \n\nRow 7 has a 1 at (7,1), a 2 at (7,2), a 2 at (7,3), and a 1 at (7,4), (7,5) is a 1, (7,6) is a ., (7,7) is a ., (7,8) is a ., (7,9) is a .. \n\nLooking at the 2 at (7,2), the adjacent squares are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). \n\n(7,1) is a 1, (7,3) is a 2, (8,1) is a 1, (8,2) is a F, (8,3) is a .. So, the two bombs around (7,2) must be in these squares. I see that (8,2) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb adjacent. Maybe (6,1) or (6,2) or (6,3) or (8,3). \n\nRow 8 has a 1 at (8,1), an F at (8,2), and the rest are . except (8,9) which is .. \n\nRow 9 has a 1 at (9,1), and the rest are . except (9,9) which is ..\n\nNow, I need to check if any of the existing flags conflict with the numbers. For example, if a number says 1 but there are two flags adjacent, that's a problem. Let me go through each number and see.\n\nStarting with (0,8) which is a 1. It has a flag at (0,9). So the other adjacent squares shouldn't have any bombs. Let's check the other adjacent squares: (0,7) is a 1, (1,7) is a ., (1,8) is a 1, (1,9) is a .. So (0,8)'s adjacent squares are all either numbers or unexplored, but no other flags. So that seems okay.\n\nNext, (1,3) is a 2, and adjacent squares include two Fs at (2,2) and (2,3). That's exactly two bombs, so that's correct.\n\n(2,8) is a 2. Adjacent squares include (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). I don't see any flags here except maybe (3,8) is a 1, which is a number, not a flag. So the two bombs must be among these squares. I'm not sure yet, but I don't see a conflict.\n\n(3,2) is a 2, with two Fs at (2,1) and (2,2). That's correct.\n\n(4,4) is a 2, but I don't see any flags around it, so the two bombs must be in the adjacent squares.\n\n(5,7) is a 2, with one flag at (6,7), so another bomb must be adjacent.\n\n(7,2) is a 2, with one flag at (8,2), so another bomb must be adjacent.\n\nNow, considering that I have two flags remaining, I need to decide where to place them. I should look for squares where the numbers indicate that a bomb must be there, and it's safe to flag without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 6, there's an F at (6,0) and (6,7). That's two bombs. Let me check around (6,0). Adjacent squares are (5,0), which is a ., (5,1) is a 1, (6,1) is a ., and (7,0) is a ., (7,1) is a 1. Since (6,0) is a flag, it's considered a bomb. The 1 at (5,1) is adjacent to (6,0), which is a bomb, so that's correct. \n\nSimilarly, (6,7) is a flag, so it's a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. For example, (5,7) is a 2, which is correct because it has two bombs: (6,7) and another one nearby.\n\nLooking at (8,2), which is a flag. Let's check the numbers around it. (7,2) is a 2, which is correct because it has (8,2) as one bomb and another bomb adjacent.\n\nI think the next step is to look for squares where the numbers indicate that a specific square must be a bomb, and then flag it if possible. Alternatively, I can look for squares where revealing them would give me more information without risk.\n\nLooking at row 9, (9,1) is a 1. It's adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,2) is a flag, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares shouldn't have any bombs. So (8,0), (8,1), (9,0), and (9,2) must be safe. So I can consider revealing one of these to get more info.\n\nBut since I have flags left, maybe I can find a square that must be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at (5,7) which is a 2, and it has a flag at (6,7). So the other bomb must be adjacent. Let's see: adjacent squares are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8). \n\n(4,7) is a 2, (5,6) is a 1, (5,8) is a ., (6,6) is a ., (6,8) is a .. \n\nI don't see any other flags here. So maybe one of these is a bomb. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking back at row 7, (7,3) is a 2. Its adjacent squares are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). \n\n(8,2) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So the other bomb must be in one of the other squares. Maybe (6,2) or (6,3) or (6,4). But I don't have enough info yet.\n\nAnother approach is to look for squares that are surrounded by numbers that can only be satisfied by a bomb. For example, if a square is adjacent to a 1 and all other adjacent squares are either numbers or flags, then it must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (3,5), which is a ., and it's adjacent to (3,4) which is a 1. So (3,4) is a 1, meaning it has exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (3,4) are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). \n\n(2,3) is a F, which is a bomb. So that's the one bomb for (3,4). So (3,5) must be safe because (3,4)'s bomb is already accounted for. So I can reveal (3,5) safely.\n\nWait, but (3,5) is adjacent to (3,4) which is a 1, and since (3,4) has a bomb at (2,3), (3,5) is safe. So revealing (3,5) would give me a number or an empty space. If I reveal it, I can get more info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a square that must be a bomb based on the numbers. For example, if a square is adjacent to a 1 and all other adjacent squares are either numbers or flags except one, then that square must be the bomb.\n\nLooking at (9,5), which is a ., and it's adjacent to (9,4) which is a ., and (8,4) which is a .. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe looking at row 4, (4,7) is a 2. Adjacent squares include (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). \n\n(5,7) is a 2, which has a flag at (6,7). So (4,7)'s two bombs could be (6,7) and another one. But (4,7) is a 2, so it needs two bombs. So maybe (5,7) is one, and another is elsewhere. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, which can help me deduce where the bombs are.\n\nLooking at (5,5), which is a 1. Adjacent squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). \n\n(5,5) is a 1, so only one bomb in these squares. Let's see if any of these are already flagged or have numbers indicating bombs. (4,4) is a 2, which needs two bombs. (5,4) is a 1, (5,6) is a 1, (6,5) is a 1, (6,6) is a .. \n\nNot sure, but maybe I can find a square here that must be a bomb.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the squares where the numbers are 1, as they have only one bomb adjacent. Let's check (0,8) again. It's a 1 with a flag at (0,9). So the other adjacent squares should have no bombs. So (0,7) is a 1, (1,7) is a ., (1,8) is a 1, (1,9) is a .. \n\nSince (0,8) is a 1 and (0,9) is a flag, the other adjacent squares can't have bombs. So (1,9) must be safe, but it's a ., so maybe I can reveal it. But since I have flags left, maybe I should flag a square instead.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (3,8) which is a 1. Adjacent squares are (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). \n\n(2,8) is a 2, (3,7) is a ., (3,9) is a ., (4,7) is a 2, (4,8) is a 1, (4,9) is a .. \n\nNot sure, but maybe (3,8) being a 1 means only one bomb in its adjacent squares. Since (2,8) is a 2, which has two bombs, but (3,8) is a 1, so only one bomb. So maybe the bomb for (3,8) is (4,8), which is a 1, but that doesn't make sense because (4,8) is a number, not a bomb. Wait, no, (4,8) is a 1, meaning it has one bomb adjacent. So maybe (3,8)'s bomb is somewhere else.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to find a square where all adjacent squares except one are either numbers or flags, and that one must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (5,5) again, which is a 1. It's adjacent to (4,4) which is a 2, (4,5) which is a ., (4,6) which is a ., (5,4) which is a 1, (5,6) which is a 1, (6,4) which is a ., (6,5) which is a 1, (6,6) which is a .. \n\nSince (5,5) is a 1, only one bomb in these squares. Let's see if any of these squares are likely to be bombs based on other numbers.\n\n(4,4) is a 2, so it needs two bombs. The adjacent squares to (4,4) are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). \n\n(3,4) is a 1, (5,4) is a 1, (5,5) is a 1. So (4,4)'s two bombs must be in (3,3), (4,3), or (5,3). Because (3,4), (5,4), and (5,5) are numbers, not bombs.\n\nWait, (5,3) is a 1, so it can't have a bomb adjacent except one. So if (4,4) needs two bombs, and (5,3) is a 1, which is adjacent to (4,4), then maybe (4,3) is a bomb. Because (5,3) is a 1, and it's adjacent to (4,3), which would be the bomb for (5,3). So if (4,3) is a bomb, then (4,4)'s two bombs would be (4,3) and maybe (3,3). \n\nBut I'm not sure. This is getting a bit too involved. Maybe I should instead look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and all other possible bomb locations are already flagged or numbered, so it must be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's surrounded by numbers that require it to be a bomb.\n\nWait, looking at (8,5), which is a ., and it's adjacent to (8,4) which is a .. Not helpful.\n\nLooking at (9,5), which is a ., and adjacent to (9,4) which is a ., (8,4) which is a .. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at (7,6), which is a ., and it's adjacent to (7,5) which is a 1, (7,7) which is a ., (6,5) which is a 1, (6,6) which is a ., (8,5) which is a ., (8,6) which is a .. \n\nSince (7,5) is a 1, it has one bomb adjacent. If I can find where that bomb is, maybe I can flag it.\n\nThe adjacent squares to (7,5) are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). \n\n(6,5) is a 1, which is a number, not a bomb. (7,4) is a 1, (7,6) is a ., (8,4) is a ., (8,5) is a ., (8,6) is a .. \n\nSo the bomb adjacent to (7,5) must be in one of these squares. Maybe (6,4) or (6,6) or (8,4) etc. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nPerhaps I should consider placing a flag where I'm more certain. Let me look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and all other adjacent squares are either numbers or flags, making it the only possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at (5,0), which is a ., adjacent to (5,1) which is a 1. So (5,1) is a 1, meaning it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (5,1) are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). \n\n(6,0) is a F, which is a bomb. So that's the one bomb for (5,1). Therefore, all other adjacent squares must be safe. So (5,0) must be safe because (5,1)'s bomb is already at (6,0). So I can reveal (5,0) safely, but since I have flags left, maybe I should flag a square instead.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (0,0), which is a ., adjacent to (0,1) which is a ., and (1,0) which is a 1. (1,0) is a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (1,0) are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). \n\n(2,0) is a F, which is a bomb. So that's the one bomb for (1,0). Therefore, (0,0) must be safe. So I can reveal (0,0) if I want, but again, maybe I should flag a square instead.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and all other adjacent squares are either numbers or flags except one, which must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (9,9), which is a ., adjacent to (9,8) which is a ., and (8,8) which is a ., (8,9) which is a .. Not helpful.\n\nLooking at (4,9), which is a ., adjacent to (4,8) which is a 1, (3,8) which is a 1, (3,9) which is a ., (5,8) which is a ., (5,9) which is a .. \n\n(4,8) is a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). \n\n(5,7) is a 2, which has a flag at (6,7). So (4,8)'s one bomb must be somewhere else. Maybe (3,7) or (4,7) or (5,8) or (5,9). But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nThis is getting a bit too time-consuming. Maybe I should consider placing a flag where I'm more certain. Let me check if any squares are definitely bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLooking back at row 6, (6,7) is a F. Let's check the numbers around it. (5,7) is a 2, which is correct because it has (6,7) as one bomb and another bomb adjacent. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at row 7, (7,3) is a 2, with a flag at (8,2). So the other bomb must be adjacent. Let's see, the adjacent squares are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). \n\n(7,2) is a 2, which has a flag at (8,2), so the other bomb must be in one of the other squares. Maybe (6,2) or (6,3) or (6,4). But I don't see any flags there.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at (7,3) again. It's a 2, so two bombs. One is at (8,2), the other must be in one of the other squares. Let's see if any of those squares are adjacent to other numbers that might indicate a bomb.\n\nFor example, (6,2) is adjacent to (5,2) which is a 1. So if (6,2) is a bomb, then (5,2)'s 1 would be satisfied. Because (5,2) is a 1, it can only have one bomb adjacent. So if (6,2) is a bomb, that would satisfy (5,2)'s 1. So maybe (6,2) is a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is adjacent to (5,3) which is a 1. So if (6,3) is a bomb, that would satisfy (5,3)'s 1.\n\nSo, either (6,2) or (6,3) could be the other bomb for (7,3)'s 2. But I can't be sure yet.\n\nMaybe I can check the numbers around (5,2). (5,2) is a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). \n\n(6,2) and (6,3) are possible bombs, but only one of them can be a bomb because (5,2) is a 1. So if I can determine which one, I can flag it.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (5,3) which is a 1, adjacent squares are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). \n\n(5,3) is a 1, so only one bomb adjacent. If (6,2) is a bomb, that would satisfy both (5,2) and (5,3). But (5,3) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb. So if (6,2) is a bomb, then (5,3)'s bomb is at (6,2). But (5,3) is adjacent to (6,3) as well, which could be another bomb, but that would make (5,3) have two bombs, which contradicts the 1. So (6,3) cannot be a bomb if (6,2) is a bomb because that would give (5,3) two bombs. Therefore, (6,3) must not be a bomb, and the other bomb for (7,3) must be somewhere else.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. If (5,3) is a 1, it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (6,2) is a bomb, then (5,3) is satisfied. But (7,3) is a 2, which needs two bombs. One is at (8,2), the other must be at either (6,2) or (6,3). But if (6,2) is a bomb, then (5,3) is satisfied. If (6,3) is a bomb, then (5,3) would have two bombs: (6,3) and maybe (4,3), but (4,3) is a ., so I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (6,4) is the other bomb for (7,3). Let's check (6,4). It's adjacent to (5,3) which is a 1, so if (6,4) is a bomb, (5,3) would have two bombs: (6,3) and (6,4), which can't be because (5,3) is a 1. So (6,4) can't be a bomb. Therefore, the other bomb for (7,3) must be either (6,2) or (6,3).\n\nBut (5,3) is a 1, so if (6,3) is a bomb, then (5,3) is satisfied. Then (6,2) can't be a bomb because (5,2) is a 1 and would need only one bomb. So maybe (6,3) is the bomb, and (6,2) is safe.\n\nWait, let me try to map this out:\n\n- (7,3) is a 2, needs two bombs. One is at (8,2), the other must be at (6,2) or (6,3).\n\n- If (6,3) is a bomb, then (5,3)'s 1 is satisfied.\n\n- Then (5,2)'s 1 must be satisfied by another bomb, which can't be (6,2) because that would make (5,2) have two bombs if (6,2) is a bomb, but (5,2) is a 1.\n\nWait, no, (5,2) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (6,2) is a bomb, then (5,2) is satisfied. But if (6,3) is a bomb, then (5,3) is satisfied, but (5,2) would still need a bomb. So maybe (6,2) is the bomb for both (7,3) and (5,2).\n\nSo, if I place a flag at (6,2), that would satisfy both (7,3)'s 2 and (5,2)'s 1. Let me check:\n\n- (7,3) is a 2: one bomb at (8,2), another at (6,2). That works.\n\n- (5,2) is a 1: adjacent to (6,2) which is a bomb. That works.\n\n- (5,3) is a 1: adjacent to (6,3), which would then need to be a bomb, but that would make (5,3) have two bombs: (6,3) and (6,2) if (6,2) is a bomb. Wait, no, (5,3) is adjacent to (6,3), not (6,2). So if (6,3) is a bomb, then (5,3) is satisfied. But if (6,2) is a bomb, (5,3) isn't affected because it's not adjacent.\n\nWait, no, (5,3) is adjacent to (6,3), not (6,2). So if (6,3) is a bomb, (5,3) is satisfied. If (6,2) is a bomb, (5,2) is satisfied. So both can be bombs without conflicting.\n\nBut wait, (7,3) is a 2, so it can only have two bombs. If both (6,2) and (6,3) are bombs, that would make (7,3) have three bombs, which contradicts the 2. So that's a problem.\n\nTherefore, only one of (6,2) or (6,3) can be a bomb. So which one is it?\n\nIf I place a flag at (6,2), then:\n\n- (7,3) has bombs at (8,2) and (6,2): total two, which is correct.\n\n- (5,2) has a bomb at (6,2): correct.\n\n- (5,3) would still need a bomb, but the only adjacent square that could be a bomb is (6,3). But (6,3) is adjacent to (7,3), which is a 2, so that's possible. But then (5,3) would have a bomb at (6,3), making it correct.\n\nWait, but (7,3) is a 2, so it can't have more than two bombs. If (6,2) and (6,3) are both bombs, then (7,3) would have three bombs: (8,2), (6,2), and (6,3). That's a problem because it's a 2.\n\nTherefore, only one of them can be a bomb. So I need to decide which one.\n\nLooking at (5,3), which is a 1, if (6,3) is a bomb, that satisfies (5,3). Then (7,3) would have bombs at (8,2) and (6,3): total two, which is correct.\n\nBut then (5,2) is a 1, which would need a bomb adjacent. The only option is (6,2). So if (6,2) is a bomb, that satisfies (5,2). But then (7,3) would have three bombs: (8,2), (6,2), and (6,3), which is a problem.\n\nTherefore, I can't have both (6,2) and (6,3) as bombs. So I have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe neither (6,2) nor (6,3) is a bomb, and the other bomb for (7,3) is somewhere else. Let me check the other adjacent squares.\n\n(7,3) is a 2, adjacent squares are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). \n\nWe have (8,2) as a bomb. The other bomb must be in one of the other squares. Let's see:\n\n- (6,2): if it's a bomb, (5,2) is satisfied, but (7,3) would have three bombs if (6,3) is also a bomb.\n\n- (6,3): if it's a bomb, (5,3) is satisfied, but (7,3) would have three bombs if (6,2) is also a bomb.\n\n- (6,4): adjacent to (5,3) which is a 1. If (6,4) is a bomb, (5,3) would have two bombs: (6,3) and (6,4), which is not allowed.\n\n- (7,2): it's a 2, not a bomb.\n\n- (7,4): it's a 1, not a bomb.\n\n- (8,3): adjacent to (8,2) which is a bomb, but (8,3) could be a bomb. Let me check if (8,3) can be a bomb.\n\nIf (8,3) is a bomb, then (7,3)'s 2 would be satisfied with (8,2) and (8,3). That would mean (7,3) has two bombs, which is correct.\n\nThen, (5,3) would still need a bomb. The only option would be (6,3), but if (6,3) is a bomb, then (5,3) is satisfied, but (7,3) would have three bombs: (8,2), (8,3), and (6,3). That's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if (8,3) is a bomb, then (7,3) is satisfied, and (5,3) would need a bomb elsewhere. Maybe (4,3) is a bomb. Let me check (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to (4,4) which is a 2. If (4,3) is a bomb, then (4,4)'s 2 would need another bomb. Let's see:\n\n(4,4) is a 2, adjacent to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). \n\nIf (4,3) is a bomb, then (4,4) needs another bomb. The only other possible is (3,3) or (5,3). \n\n(3,3) is a ., (5,3) is a 1. If (5,3) is a 1, it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (4,3) is a bomb, that would satisfy (5,3)'s 1. So (4,4) would have two bombs: (4,3) and (5,3). Wait, but (5,3) is a 1, not a bomb. So that can't be. Therefore, (4,4) would need another bomb, which can't be (5,3). So (4,4) would need a bomb at (3,3) or (5,5). \n\nIf (3,3) is a bomb, then (4,4)'s 2 is satisfied with (4,3) and (3,3). Then, (5,3) is a 1, which would have a bomb at (4,3), which is correct. \n\nBut I don't know if (3,3) is a bomb. It's a . right now. So maybe that's possible.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and all other possible bomb locations are already accounted for, making it a must-be bomb.\n\nLooking at (3,5), which is a ., adjacent to (3,4) which is a 1. Since (3,4) is a 1, it has one bomb adjacent, which is at (2,3). So (3,5) must be safe. So I can reveal (3,5) safely. But since I have flags left, maybe I should flag a square instead.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (5,0), which is a ., adjacent to (5,1) which is a 1. (5,1) is a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent at (6,0). So (5,0) must be safe. So I can reveal it, but maybe I should flag a square.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and all other possible bomb locations are already flags or numbers, making it the only possible bomb.\n\nLooking at (5,8), which is a ., adjacent to (5,7) which is a 2. (5,7) is a 2, with a flag at (6,7). So (5,7) needs another bomb. The adjacent squares are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8). \n\n(4,7) is a 2, which needs two bombs. (5,6) is a 1, (5,8) is a ., (6,6) is a ., (6,8) is a .. \n\nSo (5,7) needs another bomb. Maybe (5,8) is the bomb. If I flag (5,8), that would satisfy (5,7)'s 2. Let me check if that causes any conflicts.\n\nIf (5,8) is a bomb, then (5,7) is satisfied. Also, (5,8) is adjacent to (5,9), which is a .. So (5,9) would have a bomb at (5,8). But (5,9) is a ., so that's okay.\n\nAdditionally, (4,8) is a 1, which would have a bomb at (5,8). So that's correct.\n\nSo flagging (5,8) would satisfy both (5,7)'s 2 and (4,8)'s 1. That seems like a good move. Also, I have two flags left, so I can place one here.\n\nSo my next move would be to place a flag at (5,8).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (5,8) satisfies the number 2 at (5,7) and the number 1 at (4,8) without conflicting with other revealed numbers. This move correctly accounts for the required bombs adjacent to these numbers.\n\nMOVE: 5,8,true", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 8, "y": 2, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the information provided.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with 10 bombs in total. There are some flags already placed, and I have one flag remaining. My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without revealing any.\n\nFirst, I'll check the revealed numbers against the existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. Let me go through each revealed number and see if the adjacent flags make sense.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is a 1. It has a flag at (0,9), so that might be a conflict because if the 1 at (0,8) is supposed to have exactly one adjacent bomb, and there's a flag at (0,9), then that should be the only bomb adjacent to it. But wait, (0,8) is a 1, so it should have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. The flag at (0,9) is to the right of it, so that's one bomb. Are there any other bombs adjacent? Let me check the surrounding cells.\n\n(0,8) is at the top row, so it's adjacent to (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). (0,7) is a ., which is unexplored. (1,8) is a 1, which is a revealed number. So, the 1 at (0,8) has a flag at (0,9), which is one bomb. Are there any others? If (0,7) is a bomb, that would make two bombs adjacent to (0,8), which would conflict because it's a 1. So, (0,7) can't be a bomb because that would make the count at (0,8) 2. Therefore, (0,7) must be safe. So maybe I should reveal (0,7) to confirm.\n\nWait, but I have only one flag left. Maybe I should check other areas first.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0 is a 1. It's adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0). (0,0) is a ., (0,1) is a ., (1,1) is a 1, and (2,0) is an F. So, the 1 at (1,0) has a flag at (2,0), which is one bomb. So that's correct because the number is 1. So that's fine.\n\nRow 1, column 2 is a 2. It's adjacent to (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Let me see which of these are revealed or flagged. (1,1) is 1, (1,3) is 2, (2,3) is F. So, the 2 at (1,2) has a flag at (2,3), which is one bomb. So, there must be another bomb adjacent to it. So, the other bomb could be in any of the other adjacent cells. But I don't know where yet.\n\nRow 1, column 8 is a 1. It's adjacent to (0,7), (0,8), (1,7), (2,7), (1,9), (2,8), (2,9). (0,8) is 1, (1,9) is ., (2,9) is ., (2,8) is 1. So, the 1 at (1,8) needs exactly one bomb adjacent. There are flags at (0,9) and (2,3), but those are not adjacent to (1,8). Wait, (1,8) is adjacent to (0,7), which is ., (0,8) is 1, (1,7) is ., (2,7) is ., (1,9) is ., (2,8) is 1, (2,9) is .. So, none of these are flagged except (0,9), which is not adjacent. So, the 1 at (1,8) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. So, maybe one of the adjacent cells is a bomb, but I don't know which yet.\n\nRow 2, column 0 is F, so that's a flag. It's adjacent to (1,0) which is 1, (1,1) which is 1, (2,1) which is F, (3,0) which is 1, (3,1) which is 2. Wait, the flag at (2,0) is adjacent to (3,0) which is 1. So, the 1 at (3,0) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0) is a flag, that's one bomb. So, (3,0) can't have any other bombs adjacent. So, the cells around (3,0) like (2,0) is F, (4,0) is ., (3,1) is 2, (2,1) is F, (4,1) is 1. Wait, (3,0) is 1, so only one bomb adjacent. So, since (2,0) is a flag, that's the only one. So, the other adjacent cells must be safe. So, (4,0) must be safe, and (3,1) is 2, which has two bombs adjacent. So, (3,1) is 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. It's adjacent to (2,0) F, (2,1) F, (2,2) is ., (3,0) is 1, (3,2) is F, (4,0) is ., (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is .. So, (3,1) is 2, so it needs two bombs. It's adjacent to (2,0) F and (2,1) F, which are two flags. Wait, that's two bombs, so that's correct. So, (3,1) is 2, and it's adjacent to two flags, which is correct.\n\nWait, but (2,1) is F, which is a flag. So, that's one bomb. (2,0) is another flag, so that's two bombs. So, (3,1) is 2, which is correct. So, that's okay.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 2 is F. So, that's a flag. It's adjacent to (2,1) F, (2,2) ., (2,3) F, (3,1) 2, (3,3) 2, (4,1) 1, (4,2) ., (4,3) 1. So, (3,2) is F, so it's a flag. So, any numbers adjacent to it must account for this flag. For example, (3,3) is 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. It's adjacent to (2,2) ., (2,3) F, (3,2) F, (4,2) ., (4,3) 1, (3,4) 1. So, (3,3) is 2, and it's adjacent to two flags: (2,3) and (3,2). So that's two bombs, which matches the number. So that's correct.\n\nRow 4, column 8 is 2. It's adjacent to (3,7) ., (3,8) 1, (4,7) ., (5,7) ., (5,8) F, (5,9) ., (4,9) .. So, the 2 at (4,8) needs two bombs adjacent. It's adjacent to (5,8) F, which is one bomb. So, there must be another bomb adjacent. So, perhaps (3,7) or (4,7) or (5,9) could be bombs, but I don't know yet.\n\nRow 5, column 8 is F. So, that's a flag. It's adjacent to (4,7) ., (4,8) 2, (5,7) ., (6,7) ., (6,8) F, (5,9) ., (6,9) .. So, the flag at (5,8) is adjacent to (6,8) F, which is another flag. So, the numbers around must account for both.\n\nRow 6, column 0 is F. So, that's a flag. It's adjacent to (5,0) ., (5,1) 1, (6,1) ., (7,0) ., (7,1) 1. So, the flag at (6,0) is one bomb. The numbers around it, like (5,1) is 1, which should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (6,0) is a flag, that's one bomb. So, (5,1) is 1, which is correct.\n\nRow 7, column 1 is 2. It's adjacent to (6,0) F, (6,1) ., (6,2) ., (7,0) ., (7,2) 2, (8,0) ., (8,1) F, (8,2) F. So, the 2 at (7,1) has adjacent flags at (6,0), (8,1), and (8,2). That's three flags, but the number is 2. That's a problem because it can't have three bombs adjacent if it's a 2. So, this is a conflict. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a critical issue. The cell at (7,1) is a 2, but it's adjacent to three flags: (6,0), (8,1), and (8,2). That's three bombs, but the number is 2. So, this is a conflict. Therefore, one of these flags must be wrong. Since I have only one flag remaining, I might need to remove one of these flags to resolve the conflict.\n\nBut I can only place or remove a flag in my next move. So, perhaps I should remove a flag from one of these positions. Let me see which ones are possible.\n\nLooking at the flags at (6,0), (8,1), and (8,2). If I remove one of these flags, the count at (7,1) would go down to 2, which would be correct.\n\nBut I can only make one move, so I have to choose which flag to remove. Let's consider each option.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (6,0), then (7,1) would have two flags left: (8,1) and (8,2). That would make the count 2, which is correct. But does removing the flag at (6,0) cause any other issues?\n\nLooking at the cell (5,1), which is a 1. It's adjacent to (6,0) F, (5,0) ., (5,2) 1, (6,1) ., (6,2) ., (4,0) ., (4,1) 1, (4,2) .. So, if I remove the flag at (6,0), then (5,1) would have zero bombs adjacent, which would make it incorrect because it's a 1. So, that's a problem. Therefore, I can't remove the flag at (6,0) because it would cause (5,1) to have zero bombs, which contradicts its value of 1.\n\nNext, consider removing the flag at (8,1). If I remove that, then (7,1) would have flags at (6,0) and (8,2), which is two, matching the number 2. Does that cause any other issues?\n\nLooking at the cell (8,1): if it's a flag, but it's removed, then the adjacent cells would have one less bomb. Let's see which cells are affected.\n\nThe cell (8,1) is adjacent to (7,0) ., (7,1) 2, (7,2) 2, (8,0) ., (8,2) F, (9,0) ., (9,1) 1, (9,2) .. So, if I remove the flag at (8,1), then (7,1) goes from 3 to 2 bombs, which is correct. Also, (7,2) is a 2, which is adjacent to (8,1) and (8,2). So, if (8,1) is removed, (7,2) would have one bomb at (8,2). So, (7,2) is a 2, so it needs another bomb. Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (7,2) besides (8,2). So, perhaps (7,3) or (6,2) or (8,3) could be bombs, but I don't know yet.\n\nAlso, (9,1) is a 1, which is adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). If (8,1) is removed, then (9,1) would have one less bomb adjacent. So, if (8,1) was a flag, and it's removed, then (9,1) would have zero bombs adjacent, which would make it incorrect because it's a 1. So, that's a problem. Therefore, I can't remove the flag at (8,1) because it would cause (9,1) to have zero bombs, which contradicts its value of 1.\n\nNext, consider removing the flag at (8,2). If I remove that, then (7,1) would have flags at (6,0) and (8,1), which is two, matching the number 2. Does that cause any other issues?\n\nLooking at the cell (8,2), which is a flag. If I remove it, then (7,2) is a 2, which was adjacent to (8,1) and (8,2). So, removing (8,2) would leave (7,2) with only (8,1) as a flag, which is one bomb. So, (7,2) is a 2, so it needs another bomb. Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (7,2). So, perhaps (7,3) or (6,2) or (8,3) could be bombs, but I don't know yet.\n\nAlso, (9,1) is a 1, which is adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). If (8,2) is removed, then (9,1) would have (8,1) as a flag and possibly others. So, (9,1) is a 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. If (8,1) is still a flag, then that's one bomb. So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, (8,2) is adjacent to (7,1) and (7,2), which are both 2s. If I remove (8,2), then (7,1) would have two flags (6,0) and (8,1), which is correct. (7,2) would have (8,1) and possibly another bomb. So, that might be okay.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again. The main issue is that (7,1) is a 2 but is adjacent to three flags, which is a conflict. So, I need to resolve this by removing one of the flags. The options are (6,0), (8,1), or (8,2). But removing (6,0) causes (5,1) to have zero bombs, which is bad. Removing (8,1) causes (9,1) to have zero bombs, which is also bad. Removing (8,2) might be the only option, even though it could cause (7,2) to need another bomb, but perhaps that's manageable.\n\nSo, perhaps I should remove the flag at (8,2). That would fix the conflict at (7,1), and I can then see if (7,2) needs another bomb, which might be placed elsewhere.\n\nBut wait, I have only one flag remaining. If I remove a flag, I don't gain a flag; I just unflag a cell. So, I can only remove one flag in my move. So, if I remove (8,2), that would leave me with one flag remaining, which I could use elsewhere if needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for other areas where I can place a flag without causing conflicts. Let me check other parts of the board.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 8 is F. It's adjacent to (4,7) ., (4,8) 2, (5,7) ., (6,7) ., (6,8) F, (5,9) ., (6,9) .. So, the flag at (5,8) is one bomb. The 2 at (4,8) is adjacent to (5,8) F, so that's one bomb, and it needs another. So, perhaps (4,7) or (5,7) or (5,9) could be bombs.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 8 is 2. It's adjacent to (3,7) ., (3,8) 1, (4,7) ., (5,7) ., (5,8) F, (5,9) ., (4,9) .. So, (4,8) is 2, with one flag at (5,8). So, another bomb must be adjacent. Maybe (4,7) or (5,7) or (5,9) is a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 8 is F. It's adjacent to (5,7) ., (5,8) F, (6,7) ., (7,7) ., (7,8) ., (7,9) ., (6,9) .. So, the flag at (6,8) is one bomb. The cell (6,8) is F, so it's a flag. So, any numbers adjacent must account for this.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 7 is . It's adjacent to (6,6) ., (6,7) ., (6,8) F, (7,6) ., (7,8) ., (8,6) ., (8,7) ., (8,8) .. So, (7,7) is unexplored. Not sure.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 1 is F. It's adjacent to (7,0) ., (7,1) 2, (7,2) 2, (8,0) ., (8,2) F, (9,0) ., (9,1) 1, (9,2) .. So, (8,1) is a flag. If I remove (8,2), then (8,1) remains, and (7,1) would have two flags: (6,0) and (8,1), which is correct.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to reveal a cell instead of removing a flag, but I have to consider the conflict first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for cells that are definitely safe to reveal without causing any issues. For example, if I can find a cell that is adjacent to a number that already has all its bombs accounted for, then that cell is safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 7 is . It's adjacent to (0,6) ., (0,8) 1, (1,6) ., (1,7) ., (1,8) 1. The 1 at (0,8) has a flag at (0,9), so (0,7) must be safe because (0,8) can't have another bomb. So, revealing (0,7) would be safe.\n\nSo, maybe I should reveal (0,7). That would confirm it's safe and might help with other cells.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for other cells that are safe. For example, row 3, column 0 is 1. It's adjacent to (2,0) F, (4,0) ., (3,1) 2. So, (3,0) is 1, with a flag at (2,0). So, (3,0) can't have any other bombs adjacent. Therefore, (4,0) must be safe. So, revealing (4,0) would be safe.\n\nBut I have only one flag left, so maybe revealing is better.\n\nWait, but the conflict at (7,1) is critical. I must resolve that first. So, perhaps I should remove the flag at (8,2) to fix that conflict.\n\nSo, my move would be to remove the flag at (8,2), which is (8,2), flag=true? Wait, no. To remove a flag, I have to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So, the move would be x=8, y=2, flag=true, which would remove the flag.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, maybe I can place a flag somewhere else that doesn't cause a conflict, but I only have one flag left.\n\nWait, the conflict at (7,1) is that it's a 2 with three flags adjacent. So, I have to remove one of those flags. The options are (6,0), (8,1), or (8,2). Removing (8,2) seems to be the only option that doesn't cause another conflict elsewhere.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to remove the flag at (8,2). So, the move would be (8,2), flag=true, which removes the flag.\n\nAfter that, (7,1) would have two flags left: (6,0) and (8,1), which matches its value of 2. Also, (7,2) is a 2, which would then have one flag at (8,1) and possibly another bomb elsewhere, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, I think that's the best move to make.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (7,1) is a 2 but is adjacent to three flags, causing a conflict. Removing the flag at (8,2) resolves this conflict without causing issues elsewhere.\n\nMOVE: 8,2,true", "flags_remaining": 1, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 9, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the information provided. The board is 10x10, with 10 bombs in total. There are 2 flags remaining, so I can place two more flags if needed.\n\nLooking at the board, I see several revealed numbers and some flagged squares. My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. Since I have flags left, I should consider whether placing a flag is a good move or if I should reveal a square instead.\n\nFirst, I should check all the revealed numbers to see if any of them have conflicts with the existing flags. For example, if a square with a '1' has two adjacent flags, that's a conflict because it can only have one bomb nearby. Similarly, a '2' with only one flag must have another bomb adjacent, so I need to make sure that's possible.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is a '1', and it's adjacent to a flag at (0,9). Wait, no, (0,9) is an 'F', so that's a flag. So the '1' at (0,8) is next to a flag, meaning it can't have another bomb adjacent. So I should check if that's consistent.\n\nAlso, in row 2, columns 0,1,3 are flagged. So that's three flags already placed. Wait, the game info says flags remaining are 2, so maybe I miscounted. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board, I see 'F's at (0,9), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (5,8), (6,0). That's six flags, but the game info says flags remaining: 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, perhaps the initial flags are already placed, and I have 2 left to place. So I can only place two more flags.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The game info says flags remaining: 2, meaning I can place two more. So the existing flags are separate from that. So I need to be careful not to place more than two additional flags.\n\nNow, looking for obvious conflicts. Let me check each number tile.\n\nStarting with row 0: (0,8) is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). (0,9) is a flag, so that's one bomb. Since it's a '1', there can't be any other bombs adjacent. So the other adjacent squares must be safe. So (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) should be safe. But (1,7) and (1,8) are '_', which are revealed but empty. (1,9) is '.', so unexplored. Wait, but (0,8) is '1', so (1,9) can't be a bomb because that would make the count 2, which contradicts the '1'. So (1,9) must be safe. But since it's unexplored, maybe I should reveal it. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 1: (1,0) is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (2,0) and (2,1) are flags, so that's two bombs. But the square (1,0) is '1', which means only one bomb adjacent. So this is a conflict because it's adjacent to two flags. That's a problem. So either the flags at (2,0) or (2,1) are incorrectly placed, or the '1' at (1,0) is wrong, which can't be. So this suggests that one of those flags is wrong.\n\nWait, that's a big issue. The '1' at (1,0) can only have one bomb adjacent, but it's next to two flags at (2,0) and (2,1). So that's impossible. Therefore, one of those flags must be incorrect. So I should consider removing one of those flags to resolve the conflict.\n\nSimilarly, looking at row 2: (2,4) is '1'. Its adjacent squares include (2,3) which is a flag, so that's one bomb. So the other adjacent squares can't have any bombs. So (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) must be safe. But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nAnother approach is to look for numbers that are '1's and see if their adjacent squares can be revealed safely. For example, (0,8) is '1', and we know (0,9) is a flag, so the other adjacent squares must be safe. So maybe I can reveal (0,7) or (1,8) to check.\n\nAlternatively, looking for '2's that might have only one flag adjacent, so another bomb must be nearby. For example, (3,1) is '2'. Its adjacent squares include (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) and (2,1) are flags, so that's two bombs. But (3,1) is '2', so that can't be. Wait, that would mean (3,1) is '2' but adjacent to two flags, which is a conflict. So that suggests that either the flags are wrong or the number is wrong, which can't be. So this is another conflict.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try to map this out.\n\nAt (3,1), which is '2', the adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,0): F\n- (2,1): F\n- (2,2): .\n- (3,0): 1\n- (3,2): .\n- (4,0): .\n- (4,1): 1\n- (4,2): .\n\nSo (3,1) is '2', but it's adjacent to two flags, which would mean two bombs, making the count '2' correct. Wait, that's possible. So maybe there's no conflict there. Because the '2' is correct if there are exactly two bombs adjacent. So the two flags are the two bombs, so that's fine. So no conflict there.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. So (3,1) is '2' and has two flags adjacent, so that's correct. So no problem there.\n\nBut going back to (1,0): '1' with two flags adjacent. That's a problem. So one of those flags must be incorrect. So perhaps I should remove a flag from either (2,0) or (2,1).\n\nBut how do I decide which one? Let me look at other clues.\n\nLooking at row 2, (2,0) is F, (2,1) is F, and (2,3) is F. So three flags in row 2. But the total bombs are 10, and I have 2 flags remaining. So maybe those flags are correct, but then (1,0) is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (2,0) or (2,1) is not a bomb, so I should remove the flag there.\n\nBut I can't be sure. Maybe I should look for other clues.\n\nLooking at row 4, (4,7) is '2'. Its adjacent squares include (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (5,8) is F, so that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb adjacent to (4,7). So the other adjacent squares must include one more bomb.\n\nLooking at (5,7), which is '1', adjacent to (5,8) F, so that's one bomb. So (5,7) is '1', so no other bombs adjacent. So that means (4,7)'s other bomb must be somewhere else. So perhaps (3,6), (3,7), (4,6), (4,8), or (5,6) is a bomb.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider other areas.\n\nLooking at row 5, (5,8) is F, and (5,7) is '1'. So (5,7) is adjacent to (5,8) F, so that's one bomb. So the other adjacent squares must be safe. So (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (6,6), (6,7) must be safe. But (4,7) is '2', which needs another bomb, so perhaps (5,6) is a bomb? Wait, but (5,7) is '1', so (5,6) can't be a bomb because that would make (5,7) adjacent to two bombs, which would make it '2', but it's '1'. So (5,6) can't be a bomb. So the other bomb for (4,7) must be elsewhere, maybe (3,7) or (4,6) or (4,8).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on the conflict at (1,0). Since it's a '1' but adjacent to two flags, I must resolve that. So perhaps I should remove one of the flags at (2,0) or (2,1).\n\nBut which one? Let's see if other numbers can help.\n\nLooking at row 2, (2,4) is '1'. Its adjacent squares include (2,3) F, so that's one bomb. So the other adjacent squares must be safe. So (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) must be safe. But (1,4) is '1', so that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 0, (0,8) is '1', adjacent to (0,9) F. So the other adjacent squares must be safe. So (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) must be safe. So perhaps I can reveal (1,9) to see if it's safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to find a square that is definitely safe to reveal. For example, (1,9) is adjacent to (0,8) '1', which is already accounted for by (0,9) F. So (1,9) should be safe. So revealing (1,9) would be a good move.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (0,7), which is adjacent to (0,8) '1' and (0,6) which is '.', but I don't know if that's safe.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to reveal (1,9). Let me think about that.\n\nIf I reveal (1,9), and it's safe, then I can confirm that (0,8) is correct, and (1,9) is safe. But if I reveal a bomb, the game ends. So I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for other squares that are definitely safe. For example, if a square is adjacent to a '1' and all other adjacent squares are either flags or revealed, then it might be safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider placing a flag somewhere else, but I only have two flags left. So I need to make sure that placing a flag doesn't conflict with any numbers.\n\nWait, looking at row 6, (6,0) is F. Its adjacent squares include (5,0), which is '.', and (6,1), which is '.', and (7,0), which is '.'.\n\nAlso, (6,7) is F, but that's in row 6, column 7? Wait, no, looking back, (6,0) is F, and (6,7) is '.'.\n\nWait, no, in row 6, (6,0) is F, and (6,7) is '.', (6,8) is '.', (6,9) is '.'.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should focus on the conflict at (1,0). Since it's a '1' with two flags adjacent, I need to fix that. So perhaps I should remove one of the flags at (2,0) or (2,1). Let's see which one would cause less conflict.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (2,0), then (1,0)'s '1' would be correct because it would have only one flag at (2,1). But then, what about other squares adjacent to (2,0)? For example, (1,0) is '1', and (3,0) is '1' as well. If (2,0) is not a bomb, then (3,0)'s '1' must have a bomb somewhere else. Maybe (3,1) is '2', which is already accounted for by two flags, so that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, if I remove the flag at (2,1), then (1,0)'s '1' would have only one flag at (2,0), which is correct. Then, (2,1) would be an empty square, but what about the squares around it? For example, (1,1) is '1', which is adjacent to (2,0) F and (2,1) which is now empty. So (1,1) is '1', so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. So if (2,0) is a bomb, that's fine. But if (2,1) is not a bomb, then (1,1) is okay.\n\nBut I'm not sure which flag to remove. Maybe I should look for other clues.\n\nLooking at row 2, (2,4) is '1', adjacent to (2,3) F. So that's correct. So no conflict there.\n\nLooking at row 3, (3,0) is '1', adjacent to (2,0) F and (4,0) '.'. So if (2,0) is a bomb, then (3,0) is correct. If (2,0) is not a bomb, then (3,0) must have another bomb adjacent, but I don't see any other flags nearby.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should consider that (2,0) and (2,1) are both bombs, which would make (1,0) a '2', but it's a '1', so that's impossible. Therefore, one of those flags must be wrong.\n\nI think the best move is to remove one of the flags, probably at (2,0) or (2,1). Let's say I remove the flag at (2,0). Then, (1,0)'s '1' is correct because it's adjacent to (2,1) F. Also, (3,0)'s '1' would still be correct because it's adjacent to (2,0), which is now not a flag, but maybe it's a bomb. Wait, no, because (3,0) is '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (2,0) is a bomb, then (3,0) is correct. But if (2,0) is not a bomb, then (3,0) must have another bomb adjacent, but I don't see any other flags nearby. So maybe (2,0) is a bomb, so removing the flag there would be incorrect because it's actually a bomb. So perhaps I should remove the flag at (2,1) instead.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (2,1), then (1,0)'s '1' is correct because it's adjacent to (2,0) F. Also, (1,1) is '1', which is adjacent to (2,0) F and (2,1) which is now empty. So (1,1) is '1', which is correct if there's only one bomb adjacent, which is (2,0). So that seems okay.\n\nBut then, what about (2,1)? If it's not a bomb, then the '1' at (1,1) is correct because it's adjacent to (2,0) F. So that seems fine.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to remove the flag at (2,1), making it empty, and then (1,0) and (1,1) are correct. But I can't be sure because I don't know if (2,1) is a bomb or not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that is definitely safe, like (1,9), which is adjacent to (0,8) '1' and (0,9) F. Since (0,8) is '1', and (0,9) is a flag, (1,9) must be safe. So revealing (1,9) would be a good move because it's safe.\n\nLet me think about that. If I reveal (1,9), and it's safe, then I can confirm that (0,8) is correct, and I can move on. If it's a bomb, the game ends, but I think it's safe because (0,8) is '1' and already has one flag adjacent.\n\nSo I think I'll go with revealing (1,9) as my next move. That way, I can safely reveal a square without causing a conflict and gain more information about the board.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (1,9) is safe because (0,8) is a '1' with an adjacent flag at (0,9), meaning no other bombs are nearby. Revealing this will confirm safety and provide more info.\n\nMOVE: 1,9,false", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . .\n2 F F .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 9, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me look at the board and the game info to see what I can do.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 2 flags remaining, which means I can place two more flags if needed. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without revealing any. Since the game ends if I reveal a bomb, I have to be careful where I click.\n\nLooking at the board, I see some revealed numbers and some flags already placed. Let me go through the board row by row to spot any patterns or possible moves.\n\nStarting from the top (row 0), I see that position (0,8) is a 1 and (0,9) is a 2. Both are revealed, so no flags there. Row 1 has several 1s and a 2 at (1,9). Row 2 has a couple of Fs (flags) at (2,0) and (2,1), and a 1 at (2,4). Row 3 has a 1 at (3,0), a 2 at (3,2), and a 1 at (3,8). Row 4 has a 1 at (4,1) and a 2 at (4,7). Row 5 has a 1 at (5,1), a 1 at (5,2), a 1 at (5,3), a 1 at (5,6), and a 2 at (5,9). Row 6 has an F at (6,0), and some numbers like 1 at (6,5) and an F at (6,8). Row 7 has a 1 at (7,1), a 2 at (7,2) and (7,3), and a 1 at (7,4). Rows 8 and 9 have some 1s and 2s but mostly unexplored spaces.\n\nI need to check if any of the revealed numbers conflict with the existing flags. For example, if a number shows 1 but there are two flags around it, that's a conflict. Similarly, if a number shows 2 and only one flag is adjacent, there must be another bomb nearby.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,8) is a 1, which means it has exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). (1,9) is a 2, so it's not a bomb. (1,8) is a 1, so it's not a bomb. (0,7) is a _, which is empty but could be a bomb. Wait, but (0,8) is a 1, so there must be exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. Since (0,7) is empty, maybe the bomb is somewhere else, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nIn row 1, (1,0) is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0). (2,0) is an F, so that's a flag, which counts as a bomb. So (1,0) is a 1, and it's adjacent to a flag, so that's correct. No conflict there.\n\nIn row 2, (2,0) and (2,1) are Fs. Let's check the numbers around them. (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0), which is a 1, and (2,1), which is an F. (1,0) is a 1, so it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0) is a flag, that accounts for the one bomb. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at (2,4), which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (1,3) is a 2, (1,4) is a 1, (1,5) is a _, (2,3) is an F, (2,5) is a _, (3,3) is a 2, (3,4) is a 1, (3,5) is a _. So (2,4) is a 1, and it's adjacent to (2,3) which is a flag. So that's one bomb. Are there any other bombs adjacent? Let me check. (3,3) is a 2, which means it has two bombs around it. Since (2,3) is a flag, that's one, so there must be another bomb somewhere around (3,3). But (2,4) is a 1, so it can't have another bomb adjacent. Hmm, maybe that's a conflict. Wait, (2,4) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent, which is (2,3). So that's okay.\n\nIn row 3, (3,0) is a 1, adjacent to (2,0) which is a flag. So that's correct. (3,2) is a 2, adjacent to (2,1) which is a flag, so that's one bomb. It needs another bomb somewhere else around it. The adjacent squares are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1) is a flag, so that's one. (2,3) is a flag, so that's two. Wait, but (3,2) is a 2, so it should have exactly two bombs adjacent. So that's correct because (2,1) and (2,3) are both flags. So that's okay.\n\nRow 4, (4,1) is a 1, adjacent to (3,0) which is a 1, (3,1) which is a 1, (4,0) which is a _, (4,2) which is a _, (5,0) which is a _, (5,1) which is a 1. Wait, (4,1) is a 1, so it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Let me check the adjacent squares: (3,0) is a 1, (3,1) is a 1, (4,0) is _, (4,2) is _, (5,0) is _, (5,1) is a 1. None of these are flags or bombs, so maybe the bomb is in one of the _ squares. But I can't tell yet.\n\nRow 5, (5,1) is a 1, adjacent to (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (6,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So (5,1) is a 1, which is correct because it's adjacent to one flag. So that's okay.\n\nRow 6, (6,0) is a flag. Let's check the adjacent squares for any numbers. (5,0) is a _, (5,1) is a 1, (6,1) is a _, (7,0) is a _, (7,1) is a 1. (5,1) is a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent, which is (6,0). So that's correct.\n\nRow 7, (7,1) is a 1, adjacent to (6,0) which is a flag, so that's correct. (7,2) is a 2, adjacent to (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (6,0) is a flag, but (7,2) is a 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. Let's see: (6,1) is a _, (6,2) is _, (6,3) is _, (7,1) is a 1, (7,3) is a 2, (8,1) is a 1, (8,2) is _, (8,3) is _. So (7,2) is a 2, but I don't see any flags around it. So the two bombs must be in the adjacent _ squares. Not sure yet.\n\nNow, considering the critical flag placement rules, I need to make sure that placing a flag doesn't conflict with any revealed numbers. Also, I have two flags left, and there are 10 bombs in total. Let me count the flags already placed: (0,9) is a 2, so not a flag. (2,0), (2,1), (6,0) are Fs. So that's three flags. Wait, the game info says flags remaining: 2, so I can place two more.\n\nWait, looking back, in row 0, (0,9) is a 2, not a flag. So the flags are at (2,0), (2,1), and (6,0). So that's three flags. But the game info says flags remaining: 2, so total flags placed so far must be 10 - 2 = 8? Wait, no, the total bombs are 10, so the number of flags placed should be equal to the number of bombs, which is 10. But the game info says flags remaining: 2, so I can place two more. So total flags placed so far must be 8.\n\nWait, looking at the board, I see Fs at (2,0), (2,1), (6,0), (6,8), and maybe others? Let me count again. Row 0: no Fs except (0,9) is a 2. Row 1: no Fs. Row 2: (2,0), (2,1). Row 3: no Fs. Row 4: no Fs. Row 5: no Fs except (5,9) is a 2. Row 6: (6,0) and (6,8). Row 7: no Fs. Row 8: no Fs. Row 9: no Fs. So that's five Fs. So flags placed: 5, remaining: 2. So I can place two more.\n\nNow, I need to find where to place the next flag without conflicting with the numbers. Let me look for a square that is adjacent to a number which requires a certain number of bombs, and where placing a flag would satisfy that.\n\nLooking at row 7, (7,2) is a 2. It needs two bombs adjacent. So far, I don't see any flags around it, so the two bombs must be in the adjacent _ squares. Maybe I can check if any of those could be bombs.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, (3,3) is a 2, adjacent to (2,3) which is a flag, so that's one bomb. So it needs another bomb. The adjacent squares are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,3) is a flag. So the other bomb could be in (3,4), which is a 1. Wait, (3,4) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If I place a flag at (3,4), would that conflict? Let me see.\n\n(3,4) is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is a flag, so that's one bomb. If I place a flag at (3,4), that would be two bombs adjacent to (3,4), which is a 1. That's a conflict because a 1 can only have one bomb. So I can't place a flag at (3,4).\n\nSo, the other bomb for (3,3) must be somewhere else. Maybe (4,3)? Let me check (4,3). It's a _ square. If I place a flag there, would that conflict with any numbers?\n\nLooking at (4,3), adjacent squares include (3,2) which is a 2, (3,3) which is a 2, (3,4) which is a 1, (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). If I place a flag at (4,3), then (3,3) would have two bombs: (2,3) and (4,3), which is correct because (3,3) is a 2. Also, (3,4) is a 1, which would now have (2,3) and (4,3) as adjacent bombs, but that's two bombs, which conflicts because (3,4) is a 1. So I can't place a flag at (4,3) because it would make (3,4) have two adjacent bombs, which is invalid.\n\nSo, the other bomb for (3,3) must be somewhere else. Maybe (4,4)? (4,4) is a _ square. If I place a flag there, let's see. (3,3) would have (2,3) and (4,4), which is two bombs, correct. (3,4) is a 1, adjacent to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). If (4,4) is a flag, then (3,4) would have (2,3) and (4,4) as adjacent bombs, which is two, but (3,4) is a 1. So that's a conflict. Therefore, I can't place a flag at (4,4).\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the bomb is at (2,2)? (2,2) is a _ square. Let me check. (3,3) is a 2, so it needs two bombs. (2,3) is a flag, so the other bomb could be at (2,2). Let me see if that's possible.\n\nIf I place a flag at (2,2), then (3,3) would have two bombs: (2,3) and (2,2). That's correct. Now, checking the adjacent squares for (2,2). (1,1) is a 1, (1,2) is a 2, (2,1) is a flag, (2,3) is a flag, (3,1) is a 1, (3,2) is a 2, (3,3) is a 2. So placing a flag at (2,2) would affect several numbers.\n\nLooking at (1,2), which is a 2. Its adjacent squares include (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (2,1) and (2,3) are flags, so that's two bombs. But (1,2) is a 2, which requires exactly two bombs. So if I place a flag at (2,2), that would make three bombs adjacent to (1,2), which is a conflict because (1,2) is a 2. So I can't place a flag at (2,2).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look elsewhere for a possible flag.\n\nLooking at row 5, (5,9) is a 2. Its adjacent squares are (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9). (6,8) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So (5,9) is a 2, so it needs another bomb. The other bomb could be at (4,8) or (5,8) or (6,9). (4,8) is a 1, (5,8) is a 2, (6,9) is a _.\n\nIf I place a flag at (4,8), let's see. (4,8) is a 1, so placing a flag there would make it a bomb. But (5,9) is a 2, which would then have two bombs: (6,8) and (4,8). That's correct. Also, (4,8) is a 1, which would have exactly one bomb adjacent. Wait, but (4,8) is a 1, so it should have one bomb adjacent. If I place a flag at (4,8), that would make (4,8) a bomb, but then the adjacent squares to (4,8) would have that bomb. Let me check.\n\n(4,8) is adjacent to (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (5,9) is a 2, (4,7) is a 2, (3,8) is a 1. If I place a flag at (4,8), then (3,8) is a 1, which would have one bomb at (4,8). That's correct. (4,7) is a 2, which would have (4,8) as one bomb, so it needs another bomb somewhere else. (5,9) would have (6,8) and (4,8) as bombs, which is two, correct.\n\nSo placing a flag at (4,8) seems possible. Let me check if that causes any conflicts elsewhere. (4,8) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If I place a flag there, it becomes a bomb, so the adjacent squares must have exactly one bomb. Wait, no: (4,8) is a 1, meaning it has exactly one bomb adjacent. If I place a flag there, that would mean (4,8) is a bomb, so the adjacent squares must account for that.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when I place a flag on a square, it's marking it as a bomb. So if I place a flag at (4,8), it's a bomb, and the numbers around it must reflect that.\n\nLooking at (4,8), which is a 1. If I place a flag there, then the adjacent squares must have exactly one bomb. But (4,8) is a bomb, so the adjacent squares that are numbers must account for that.\n\nFor example, (3,8) is a 1. It's adjacent to (4,8), which would be a bomb. So (3,8) is a 1, which is correct because it has one bomb adjacent.\n\n(4,7) is a 2. It's adjacent to (4,8), which is a bomb, so it needs another bomb somewhere else. So (4,7) is a 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. One is (4,8), so another must be nearby.\n\n(5,8) is a 2. It's adjacent to (4,8) and (5,9). (5,9) is a 2, which is already accounted for with (6,8) and (4,8). So (5,8) is a 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. It has (4,8) and (5,9), but (5,9) is a number, not a bomb. Wait, no: (5,9) is a 2, so it's a number, not a bomb. So (5,8) is a 2, adjacent to (4,8) which is a bomb, and (5,9) which is a number. So it needs another bomb. Maybe at (5,7) or (6,8). (6,8) is a flag, so that's a bomb. So (5,8) is adjacent to (4,8) and (6,8), which are two bombs, so that's correct.\n\nSo placing a flag at (4,8) seems okay. Let me check if any other numbers would be affected. (3,7) is a _, (3,9) is a ., (5,7) is a 1. (5,7) is a 1, adjacent to (4,7) which is a 2. If (4,8) is a bomb, then (5,7) is a 1, which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. So the adjacent squares to (5,7) are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (4,8) is a bomb, (6,8) is a bomb. So that's two bombs, which would make (5,7) a 2, but it's a 1. So that's a conflict.\n\nAh, that's a problem. If I place a flag at (4,8), then (5,7) is a 1 but would have two bombs adjacent: (4,8) and (6,8). That's a conflict because (5,7) is a 1, which can only have one bomb. So I can't place a flag at (4,8) because it would cause a conflict with (5,7).\n\nSo, I need to find another place to put a flag. Let me look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 6, (6,8) is a flag. Its adjacent squares include (5,7), (5,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). (5,7) is a 1, (5,8) is a 2, (6,7) is a ., (7,7) is a ., (7,8) is a ., (7,9) is a .. So (6,8) is a flag, which is a bomb. So (5,7) is a 1, which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. It's adjacent to (6,8), which is a bomb, so that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at row 7, (7,2) is a 2. It needs two bombs. The adjacent squares are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (6,0) is a flag, but not adjacent to (7,2). So (7,2) is a 2, needs two bombs. Are there any flags nearby? No. So the bombs must be in the _ squares. Maybe I can place a flag at (6,2) or (6,3). Let me check.\n\nIf I place a flag at (6,2), then (7,2) would have one bomb. It needs another. Also, (6,2) is adjacent to (5,1), which is a 1. (5,1) is a 1, which is adjacent to (6,0) (a flag) and (6,1), (6,2). If I place a flag at (6,2), then (5,1) would have two bombs adjacent: (6,0) and (6,2), but (5,1) is a 1, which can only have one bomb. So that's a conflict. Therefore, I can't place a flag at (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, placing a flag at (6,3) would affect (5,2), which is a 1. (5,2) is a 1, adjacent to (6,2) and (6,3). If I place a flag at (6,3), then (5,2) would have one bomb at (6,3), which is correct. Also, (7,2) would have one bomb at (6,3), but it needs two, so I'd still need another bomb. Maybe (8,2)? Let me check.\n\n(8,2) is a _ square. If I place a flag there, (7,2) would have two bombs: (6,3) and (8,2). That would be correct. Also, (8,2) is adjacent to (7,1), which is a 1. (7,1) is a 1, which would have one bomb at (8,2), correct. Also, (8,2) is adjacent to (8,1), which is a 1, and (8,3), which is a .. So placing flags at (6,3) and (8,2) would satisfy (7,2)'s requirement of two bombs. But I only have two flags left, so maybe I can do that.\n\nWait, but I can only place one flag at a time. So perhaps I should place one flag and see. Let me consider placing a flag at (6,3). Then, (7,2) would have one bomb, needing another. But I can only place two flags, so maybe that's a way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find another square that is more certain. Let me look at row 9. It's mostly unexplored, but maybe there's a number that can help.\n\nLooking at row 8, (8,1) is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,1) is a 1, which is adjacent to (6,0) (a flag). So (8,1) is a 1, which must have one bomb adjacent. The only flag nearby is (6,0), but that's two rows up. So maybe the bomb is at (7,0) or (8,0) or (9,1). Not sure.\n\nLooking back, maybe I should focus on row 5, (5,9) is a 2. It needs two bombs adjacent. It's adjacent to (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9). (6,8) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So it needs another bomb. The other bomb could be at (4,8), (5,8), or (6,9). (5,8) is a 2, so it's a number, not a bomb. (4,8) is a 1, which could be a bomb, but earlier that caused a conflict. (6,9) is a ., which is unexplored.\n\nIf I place a flag at (6,9), let's see. (5,9) is a 2, which would have (6,8) and (6,9) as bombs, which is two, correct. (6,9) is adjacent to (5,8), which is a 2, and (5,9), which is a 2. (5,8) is a 2, so it needs two bombs. It's adjacent to (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). If (6,9) is a flag, then (5,8) would have (6,8) and (6,9) as bombs, which is two, correct.\n\nAlso, (6,9) is adjacent to (7,8) and (7,9). (7,8) is a ., (7,9) is a .. So placing a flag at (6,9) seems okay.\n\nLet me check if placing a flag at (6,9) causes any conflicts. (5,9) is a 2, which would have two bombs: (6,8) and (6,9). Correct. (6,9) is adjacent to (5,8), which is a 2, so that's okay. (6,9) is also adjacent to (7,8) and (7,9), which are unexplored. So no conflict there.\n\nSo placing a flag at (6,9) seems safe. Let me check if that's allowed. The flags remaining are 2, so I can do that.\n\nSo, the next move would be to place a flag at (6,9). Let me write that.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (6,9) satisfies the requirement for (5,9) to have two adjacent bombs, as it already has one at (6,8). This move does not conflict with any revealed numbers nearby.\n\nMOVE: 6,9,true", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . 2\n2 F F .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. It's a 10x10 grid, and there are some numbers and flags already placed. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. I have one flag remaining, and there are 10 bombs in total.\n\nLooking at the board, I see several flags already placed, especially in rows 0, 2, and 6. I need to make sure that any new flag I place doesn't conflict with the numbers shown on the board. Also, I should check if any existing flags might be incorrectly placed based on the numbers around them.\n\nLet me start by checking the revealed numbers for any obvious conflicts with the flags. For example, if a square shows '1' and it's adjacent to two flags, that's a conflict because the number indicates only one bomb nearby.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 8 is a '1' and column 9 is an 'F'. The square at (0,8) has a '1', which means there's exactly one bomb in the adjacent squares. The adjacent squares to (0,8) are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). Since (1,9) is a '2', which might have its own implications, but I don't see any flags around (0,8) except (0,9), which is an 'F'. Wait, (0,9) is an 'F', so that's one flag. The number at (0,8) is '1', so that should be the only bomb adjacent. But I don't see any other flags around it, so that seems okay for now.\n\nMoving to row 1, column 0 is a '1', and it's adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0). There's a flag at (2,0), which is an 'F'. So the '1' at (1,0) has one flag adjacent. That's okay because the number is '1', so that's the only bomb. But wait, if (1,0) is '1' and it's adjacent to a flag, that flag must be the only bomb, so that seems correct.\n\nLooking at row 2, columns 0 and 1 are both 'F's. The square at (2,3) is an 'F' as well. Let me check the numbers around these flags. For example, (2,0) is an 'F', and the square above it at (1,0) is a '1', which we've already considered. The square at (2,1) is an 'F', and the square above it at (1,1) is a '1'. Wait, (1,1) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (2,1) which is an 'F'. So that's one bomb accounted for, which is correct.\n\nNow, looking at row 6, there are multiple 'F's at columns 0, 7, and 9. Let me check the numbers around these. For example, (6,0) is an 'F', and the square above it at (5,0) is a '1'. So (5,0) is a '1' and adjacent to (6,0)'s flag. That's correct because the '1' indicates one bomb, which is the flag. But wait, (5,0) is a '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (6,0) is an 'F', that's the only bomb. Let me check if there are any other bombs adjacent to (5,0). The adjacent squares are (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), and (6,1). (4,0) is '_', (4,1) is '1', (5,1) is '1', and (6,1) is '_'. So no other bombs except (6,0), which is correct.\n\nAnother area to check is row 3, column 0 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (2,0) which is an 'F', so that's the one bomb. Correct.\n\nNow, looking for potential conflicts or places where a flag might be misplaced. Let's see. Row 0, column 9 is an 'F', and the square at (0,8) is a '1'. So (0,8) has one bomb adjacent, which is (0,9)'s 'F'. That seems okay.\n\nWait, but looking at row 1, column 9 is a '2'. So (1,9) is '2', which means there are two bombs adjacent to it. Let's see where those bombs could be. The adjacent squares are (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), and (2,9). (0,8) is '1', (0,9) is 'F', (1,8) is '_', and (2,9) is '2'. So (1,9) is '2', and it's adjacent to (0,9)'s 'F', so that's one bomb. It needs another bomb somewhere else. Let's check the possible squares. (1,8) is '_', (2,8) is '1', (2,9) is '2'. Hmm, maybe the other bomb is at (2,8), which is '1', but that square is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Wait, no, (2,8) is '1', meaning it's a revealed square with one bomb adjacent. So the other bomb for (1,9) must be somewhere else. Maybe (1,8) is a bomb? But (1,8) is '_', which is unexplored. Alternatively, perhaps (2,9) is a bomb, but (2,9) is '2', which is a number. So that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\n(1,9) is '2', so it needs two bombs adjacent. It's adjacent to (0,8) which is '1', (0,9) 'F', (1,8) '_', and (2,9) '2'. So one bomb is at (0,9), so where's the other? It must be either (1,8) or (2,8). But (2,8) is '1', so it's a number, meaning it's a safe square. So the other bomb must be at (1,8). But (1,8) is '_', so it's unexplored. So maybe that's a possible location for a bomb.\n\nBut wait, I can't place a flag there yet because I have only one flag left. Maybe I should check if that's a good move.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 2, column 2 is '_', and column 3 is 'F'. Let me check the numbers around (2,3). The square at (2,3) is 'F', and the square above it at (1,3) is '2'. So (1,3) is '2', which means it has two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares to (1,3) are (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,4), and (2,3). (0,2) is '_', (0,3) is '_', (1,2) is '_', (1,4) is '1', and (2,3) is 'F'. So the two bombs must be (2,3) and possibly another one. But (1,3) is '2', so it needs two bombs. Since (2,3) is an 'F', that's one bomb, so there must be another bomb adjacent to (1,3). Let's see where that could be. Maybe (0,3) is a bomb? But (0,3) is '_', so it's unexplored. Alternatively, (1,2) or (1,4). (1,4) is '1', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So perhaps (0,3) is a bomb. But I don't know yet.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for other areas where I can place a flag without conflicting with the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 0 is 'F', and the square above it at (5,0) is '1'. That seems okay. Now, row 6, column 7 is 'F', and the square at (6,7) is 'F'. Let me check the numbers around it. The square at (6,6) is '_', (5,6) is '_', (5,7) is '_', (6,8) is '_', (7,6) is '_', (7,7) is '_', etc. Not sure if that's helpful.\n\nWait, looking at row 7, column 0 is '_', column 1 is '1', column 2 is '2', column 3 is '2', column 4 is '1', column 5 is '1', and columns 6-9 are '_'. So (7,1) is '1', which means it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (6,0), (6,1), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0) is 'F', so that's one bomb. So (7,1) is '1' and has one bomb at (6,0). That seems correct.\n\nNow, looking at row 8, column 1 is '1', so it needs one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,1) is '1', so that's a number. (6,0) is 'F', but that's two rows above. Wait, (8,1) is '1', so it needs one bomb. The possible squares are (7,0), (7,1), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,1) is '1', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. (6,0) is 'F', but that's not adjacent to (8,1). So the bomb must be in one of the other squares. Maybe (9,1) is a bomb? But (9,1) is '_', so it's unexplored. Alternatively, (8,0) or (8,2). Not sure.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck trying to find where to place the next flag. Maybe I should consider revealing a square instead. Let me see where it's safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0 is '_', but it's in the top-left corner. It's adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). (1,0) is '1', which has a flag at (2,0), so that's accounted for. (0,1) is '_', and (1,1) is '1' with a flag at (2,1). So maybe (0,0) is safe? But I'm not sure. If I reveal it, I might get a number that could help.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, column 0 is '_', and (5,0) is '1', so it's a number. That means it's safe, but it's already revealed. Wait, no, (5,0) is '1', so it's a number, but (5,0) is already revealed as '1'. So perhaps (5,1) is '1' as well. Wait, (5,1) is '1', so it's a number, meaning it's safe. Maybe I can reveal (5,1) but it's already revealed as '1'.\n\nWait, no, (5,1) is '1', so it's already a number. So maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 0 is '_', and (4,0) is adjacent to (3,0) which is '1', (4,1) which is '1', and (5,0) which is '1'. So if I reveal (4,0), what would happen? Since (3,0) is '1' and has a flag at (2,0), that's accounted for. (4,1) is '1', which is adjacent to (4,0). So if (4,0) is revealed, it might show a number that could help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that's surrounded by numbers which can help me deduce whether it's a bomb or not.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 5 is '_', and (2,5) is adjacent to (2,4) which is '1', (2,6) which is '_', (1,4) which is '1', (1,5) which is '_', (3,4) which is '1', and (3,5) which is '_'. So maybe (2,5) is a good candidate to reveal because it's surrounded by numbers that could give me clues.\n\nAlternatively, row 3, column 5 is '_', and (3,5) is adjacent to (3,4) which is '1', (2,4) which is '1', (4,4) which is '_', and others. So maybe revealing (3,5) could help.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Since I have one flag left, maybe it's better to use it where I'm certain. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's likely to be safe based on the numbers.\n\nWait, looking back at row 1, column 9 is '2', and I thought the other bomb might be at (1,8). If I can confirm that, maybe I can place a flag there. But I don't have any information about (1,8) yet. It's '_', so it's unexplored. But if I place a flag there, I need to make sure it doesn't conflict with any numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check row 9, column 1, which is '1'. It's adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,1) is '1', so it needs one bomb. If I can find where that bomb is, maybe I can place a flag.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a '1' and is the only possible bomb location. For example, row 5, column 5 is '_', and it's adjacent to (5,4) which is '_', (5,6) which is '1', and others. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at row 7, column 2 is '2', which means it has two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are (6,1), (6,2), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (7,1) is '1', which has a bomb at (6,0). So the other bomb for (7,2) must be somewhere else. Maybe (6,2) is a bomb? Or (8,2)? Not sure.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a '1' and is the only possible bomb location. For example, row 8, column 1 is '1', so it needs one bomb adjacent. The possible squares are (7,0), (7,1), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,1) is '1', so it has a bomb at (6,0). So the bomb for (8,1) must be in one of the other squares. Maybe (8,0) is a bomb? But (8,0) is '_', so it's possible. Alternatively, (9,1) could be a bomb.\n\nBut I don't know yet. Maybe I should consider placing a flag at (8,0) if it's the only possible location for the bomb adjacent to (8,1). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's adjacent to a '1' to see if it's a bomb or not. For example, revealing (4,0) which is adjacent to (3,0)'s '1' and (4,1)'s '1'. If I reveal (4,0) and it's a '1', that might help.\n\nBut I'm not certain. Since I have one flag left, I need to make sure it's placed correctly.\n\nWait, looking at row 6, column 9 is 'F', and (6,8) is '_', (6,9) is 'F', (7,8) is '_', (7,9) is '_', (5,8) is '1', (5,9) is '2'. So (5,9) is '2', which needs two bombs. It's adjacent to (5,8) which is '1', (4,8) which is '_', (4,9) which is '_', (6,8) which is '_', (6,9) which is 'F', (5,9) is '2', and (5,10) which is beyond the board. So one bomb is at (6,9), so the other must be at (5,8) or (4,8) or (4,9). But (5,8) is '1', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So the other bomb must be at (4,8) or (4,9). But I don't know yet.\n\nI think I need to make a move. Since I have one flag left, I should look for a square that is definitely a bomb based on the numbers. Alternatively, if I can't find such a square, maybe I should reveal a square that's likely to be safe.\n\nLooking back at row 0, column 0 is '_', and it's adjacent to (1,0) which is '1' and has a flag at (2,0). So (0,0) is adjacent to (1,0)'s '1', which has one bomb at (2,0). So (0,0) is adjacent to (1,0), which is '1', meaning (0,0) can't be a bomb because (1,0) already has its bomb accounted for. So (0,0) is safe. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, (1,0) is '1', which means it has exactly one bomb adjacent. That bomb is at (2,0). So (0,0) is adjacent to (1,0), which is '1', but (0,0) could still be a bomb if (1,0)'s '1' is from (2,0). So revealing (0,0) might be safe because (1,0) is '1' and already has its bomb. Alternatively, (0,0) could be a bomb, but that would conflict with (1,0)'s '1' because (1,0) is adjacent to both (0,0) and (2,0). So if (0,0) is a bomb, then (1,0) would have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts its '1'. Therefore, (0,0) cannot be a bomb. So it's safe to reveal (0,0).\n\nSo my move would be to reveal (0,0) because it's safe based on the '1' at (1,0) which already has its bomb at (2,0). Revealing (0,0) will give me more information about the board.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere else, but I'm not sure where. So I think revealing (0,0) is the safer move.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (0,0) is safe because the adjacent square (1,0) is a '1' with its bomb already flagged at (2,0), so (0,0) cannot be a bomb.\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 1, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . 2\n2 F F .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 1, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current board state and the game info provided. \n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The flags remaining are 1, which means I can place one more flag. I need to be careful not to place a flag where it's not a bomb because that would waste my flag, and I might not have another chance.\n\nLooking at the board, I see several revealed numbers and some flagged squares (marked with F). I should check if any of the revealed numbers are conflicting with the existing flags because that might indicate where a bomb is or isn't.\n\nStarting with row 0, I see that at (0,8) there's a 1 and at (0,9) there's a 2. The 1 at (0,8) means there's exactly one bomb in the surrounding eight squares. The 2 at (0,9) means there are two bombs around it. Since (0,8) is a 1, if any of its adjacent squares are flagged, that could help determine where the bomb is.\n\nLooking at row 1, there's a 1 at (1,0) and a 2 at (1,4). Also, there are some unexplored spaces and a few flags. I should check if these numbers are consistent with the flags around them.\n\nIn row 2, there are two F's at (2,0) and (2,1). These are flagged as bombs. I should see if the numbers around them make sense. For example, the 1 at (2,4) should have exactly one bomb around it, and since (2,0) and (2,1) are already flagged, maybe that's the only one.\n\nMoving to row 3, there's a 2 at (3,1), which means two bombs around it. The F at (3,2) might be one of them, so there should be another bomb nearby. But I need to check the surrounding squares to see if that's possible without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nRow 4 has a 1 at (4,1), which is adjacent to some unexplored spaces. I need to make sure that placing a flag here or revealing it doesn't conflict with the existing numbers.\n\nLooking at row 5, there's a 1 at (5,1) and a 2 at (5,8). The 2 at (5,8) is next to an F at (5,9), so there should be another bomb nearby.\n\nRow 6 has F's at (6,0), (6,7), and (6,9). That's three flags, but the total bombs are 10, so I need to be cautious. The numbers around these flags should add up correctly.\n\nRow 7 has a 1 at (7,1), a 2 at (7,2), and another 2 at (7,3). These numbers should help determine where the remaining bombs are.\n\nRows 8 and 9 have some 1's and unexplored spaces, but not as many numbers as the upper rows.\n\nNow, I need to check each revealed number to see if the adjacent flags and numbers make sense. For example, if a 1 has two flags next to it, that's a conflict because a 1 should only have one bomb adjacent. Similarly, a 2 with only one flag should have another bomb somewhere else.\n\nLooking at (0,8) which is a 1. The adjacent squares would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). (0,9) is a 2, so it's not a bomb. (1,8) is 1, (1,9) is 2. So the bomb adjacent to (0,8) must be either (0,7) or (1,7). But I don't see any flags there, so maybe that's where a bomb is.\n\nWait, (0,7) is a 1, so maybe that's a bomb? But no, (0,7) is a 1, meaning it's a number, not a bomb. So the bomb must be somewhere else. Maybe (1,7) is a bomb, but (1,7) is an empty revealed space, so that can't be. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, (0,8) is a 1, so it has exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,7): which is a 1, so it's a number, not a bomb.\n- (1,7): which is empty.\n- (1,8): which is 1, so a number.\n- (1,9): which is 2, a number.\n\nSo none of these are bombs, which is confusing because (0,8) is a 1. That suggests that the bomb must be elsewhere, but I'm not seeing it. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, (0,8) is at row 0, column 8. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- Up: None, since it's row 0.\n- Down: (1,8)\n- Left: (0,7)\n- Right: (0,9)\n- Diagonals: (1,7) and (1,9).\n\nSo the only possible bombs are in (1,7) or (1,9). But (1,9) is a 2, which is a number, not a bomb. So the bomb must be at (1,7). But (1,7) is an empty space, so maybe it's unexplored. So perhaps (1,7) is a bomb, but I can't confirm yet.\n\nLooking at (1,7), it's an empty revealed space, so it's not a bomb. Wait, that's confusing. If (0,8) is a 1, and none of the adjacent squares are bombs, then something's wrong. Maybe I'm miscalculating the adjacent squares.\n\nWait, (0,8) is at row 0, column 8. So the adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,7), (0,9)\n- (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)\n\nBut (1,7) is empty, (1,8) is 1, (1,9) is 2. So none of these are bombs. That can't be right because (0,8) is a 1, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the board state.\n\nWait, looking back, the board state shows row 0 as: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F. So (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2, and (0,10) is F? Wait, no, the columns go from 0 to 9 because it's a 10x10 board. So (0,9) is the last column, and (0,10) doesn't exist. So (0,9) is 2, and (0,8) is 1.\n\nSo the adjacent squares to (0,8) are:\n\n- (0,7), (0,9)\n- (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)\n\nSo (0,7) is _, (0,9) is 2, (1,7) is _, (1,8) is 1, (1,9) is 2.\n\nSo the only possible bomb is in (0,7) or (1,7). But (0,7) is a revealed empty space, so it's not a bomb. (1,7) is also empty. So that's a problem because (0,8) is a 1, meaning there should be exactly one bomb adjacent, but I don't see any. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe (0,7) is a bomb, but it's revealed as empty. No, that can't be. So perhaps the bomb is elsewhere, but that's impossible because those are the only adjacent squares. This suggests that there's a conflict, meaning that maybe the flag at (0,9) is incorrect. But (0,9) is a 2, so it's a number, not a flag. Wait, no, in row 0, the last square is F, which is (0,9). Wait, no, looking back:\n\nRow 0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n\nSo (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2, and (0,10) is F? No, columns go from 0 to 9, so (0,9) is F. Wait, that can't be because the board is 10x10, so (0,9) is the 10th column, which is F. So (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2, and (0,10) doesn't exist. Wait, maybe the board is written as columns 0-9, so row 0 has columns 0-9, with (0,8) as 1, (0,9) as 2, but that would make (0,9) the last column. So (0,9) is 2, not F. Wait, looking again:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n\nWait, that's 11 elements, which is impossible for a 10x10 board. So perhaps the user made a typo. Maybe it's:\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2\n\nAnd then F is at (0,9)? Or perhaps it's a mistake. This is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the board state is written as:\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n\nBut that's 11 columns, which can't be right. So perhaps it's a typo, and the F is at (0,9). So (0,8)=1, (0,9)=2, and maybe (0,10) is F, but that's beyond the board. So perhaps the F is at (0,9), making (0,9)=F. That would make sense because the last element is F.\n\nSo, assuming (0,9) is F, then (0,8)=1, (0,9)=F. So the adjacent squares to (0,8) would be:\n\n- (0,7), (0,9)\n- (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)\n\n(0,9) is F, which is a flag, so that's a bomb. Therefore, the 1 at (0,8) is satisfied by the flag at (0,9). So that makes sense because (0,8) is 1, and it's adjacent to a bomb at (0,9). So that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on. Let's check other numbers.\n\nLooking at (1,0)=1. Its adjacent squares would be:\n\n- (0,0), (0,1)\n- (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)\n\n(2,0) and (2,1) are F, so that's two flags. But (1,0) is 1, meaning only one bomb should be adjacent. However, there are two flags adjacent, which is a conflict. That suggests that either one of the flags is incorrect or the number is wrong, but since the number is given, it must be that one of the flags is wrong.\n\nSo, (1,0) is a 1, but it's adjacent to two F's at (2,0) and (2,1). That's a conflict because a 1 can only have one adjacent bomb. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrect. But since I can only place one more flag, I need to consider whether to remove one of these flags.\n\nBut wait, the game allows placing or removing flags. So maybe I should remove one of these flags because they're causing a conflict with the 1 at (1,0). But which one?\n\nLooking at (2,0) and (2,1), both are F. Let's see what other numbers are around them.\n\nLooking at (2,4)=1. Its adjacent squares would include (2,3), (2,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Since (2,4)=1, there should be exactly one bomb adjacent.\n\nIf (2,0) and (2,1) are both F, then (2,4) is 1, which would mean that the only bomb adjacent to it is one of these, but (2,0) and (2,1) are two bombs, which would make (2,4) at least 2, which contradicts the 1. Therefore, this is a problem.\n\nSo, the presence of both F at (2,0) and (2,1) is causing conflicts with (1,0)=1 and (2,4)=1. Therefore, at least one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\nSince the game has 10 bombs and I have 1 flag remaining, I need to decide whether to remove a flag or place a new one. But removing a flag would allow me to place another, but I only have one left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square to get more information. Let's see where I can safely reveal a square without hitting a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,0) is empty. Maybe revealing that would help, but it's a bit risky. Alternatively, looking at (1,5) which is empty, but I don't know the number.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, so that revealing them would give me more info.\n\nLooking at (1,5) which is empty, but (1,4)=2. So (1,5) is adjacent to (1,4)=2, which could help determine if it's a bomb or not.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (3,5) which is empty, adjacent to (3,4)=1. If (3,5) is revealed, and it's a number, that could help.\n\nBut perhaps the best move is to address the conflict caused by the two F's at (2,0) and (2,1). Since (1,0)=1 is conflicting with two F's, I need to remove one of them. But which one?\n\nLooking at (2,0): what other numbers are around it? (0,0) is empty, (1,0)=1, (2,1)=F, (3,0)=1. So (3,0)=1 is adjacent to (2,0). If (2,0) is a bomb, then (3,0)=1 is correct because it's adjacent to one bomb. Similarly, (2,1) is adjacent to (1,0)=1 and (3,1)=2.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (2,0), then (1,0)=1 would still have (2,1)=F as an adjacent bomb, which would satisfy the 1. Also, (3,0)=1 would lose its adjacent bomb, which would be a problem because (3,0)=1 would then have no adjacent bombs, which is a conflict. Therefore, (3,0)=1 must have exactly one bomb adjacent. So if I remove (2,0), (3,0)=1 would have no bombs adjacent, which is wrong. Therefore, (2,0) must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, if I remove (2,1), then (1,0)=1 would still have (2,0)=F as an adjacent bomb, satisfying the 1. Also, (3,1)=2 would lose one adjacent bomb, so it should have another one elsewhere. Let's see: (3,1)=2 is adjacent to (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F (if not removed), (2,2)=., (3,0)=1, (3,2)=F, (4,0)=., (4,1)=1, (4,2)=.. So if (2,1) is removed, (3,1)=2 would have (2,0)=F and (3,2)=F as adjacent bombs, which is two, satisfying the 2. So that might be okay.\n\nWait, but (3,1)=2 would have (2,0)=F and (3,2)=F as adjacent, so that's two bombs, which is correct. So if I remove (2,1), then (1,0)=1 would still have (2,0)=F as an adjacent bomb, which is correct. Also, (3,0)=1 would still have (2,0)=F as adjacent, which is correct. So removing (2,1) seems better because it resolves the conflict without causing other issues.\n\nSo, perhaps I should remove the flag at (2,1). That would mean making a move with flag=true on (2,1) to remove it. But wait, in the move format, flag=true is to place a flag, and to remove, I need to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So, the move would be (2,1), flag=true, which would remove the flag.\n\nBut I have only one flag remaining, so I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe I should instead reveal a square that would give me more information about whether (2,1) is a bomb or not.\n\nLooking at (2,2), which is empty. If I reveal (2,2), and it's a number, that could help. But if it's a bomb, the game ends, which is risky.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (2,3)=F, which is a flag. Let me check if that's correct. (2,3)=F is adjacent to (2,4)=1. So (2,4)=1 must have exactly one bomb adjacent. If (2,3)=F is a bomb, then (2,4)=1 is satisfied. But if (2,3) is not a bomb, then there must be another bomb adjacent to (2,4)=1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus back on the conflict at (1,0)=1.\n\nSo, to resolve the conflict, I think removing the flag at (2,1) would be the correct move because it would satisfy both (1,0)=1 and (3,1)=2. Let me check:\n\nAfter removing (2,1), (1,0)=1 would have only (2,0)=F as adjacent, which is correct. (3,1)=2 would have (2,0)=F and (3,2)=F as adjacent, which is correct. (3,0)=1 would have (2,0)=F as adjacent, which is correct. So this seems to resolve the conflict.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to remove the flag at (2,1). So the move would be (2,1), flag=true, which would remove the flag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere else, but I only have one flag left. But considering the conflict, it's better to remove the incorrect flag first.\n\nSo, the move is to remove the flag at (2,1), which would be (2,1), flag=true.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The flag at (2,1) is causing a conflict with the number 1 at (1,0), as it creates an impossible scenario where a '1' would have two adjacent bombs. Removing this flag resolves the conflict without introducing others.\n\nMOVE: 2,1,true", "flags_remaining": 1, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . 2\n2 F F .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 7, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let's start by understanding the current board state and the rules provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board. It's a 10x10 grid, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has already placed some flags, and there are 2 flags remaining. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without revealing any.\n\nI notice that some squares are already revealed with numbers, which indicate the number of adjacent bombs. For example, at position (0,8) there's a 1, and at (0,9) there's a 2. Also, there are several 'F's indicating flags placed by the player.\n\nThe critical flag placement rules are important here. Each number must exactly match the number of adjacent bombs. So, if a square shows '1', it can only have one bomb adjacent to it. If it already has a flag next to it, there can't be another bomb nearby. Similarly, a '2' must have exactly two bombs adjacent, so if one is already flagged, another must be present.\n\nI should start by checking all revealed numbers against existing flags to spot any conflicts. Let's go row by row.\n\nLooking at row 0: positions (0,8) is 1 and (0,9) is 2. Since (0,8) is 1, it can only have one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). Since (0,7) is a '.', it's unexplored, but (1,8) is 1 and (1,9) is 2. Wait, no, (1,8) is 1 and (1,9) is 2. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up rows and columns. Let me clarify: the board is x (row) and y (column), so (0,8) is row 0, column 8. Its adjacent squares are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). Since (0,8) is 1, it must have exactly one bomb in those three squares.\n\nLooking at row 1: (1,0) is 1, (1,1) is 1, (1,2) is 1, (1,3) is 2, (1,8) is 1, and (1,9) is 2. So, for (1,0) which is 1, the adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). But (0,0) is '_', so it's empty, and (1,1) is 1, which is another number. This might mean that the bomb adjacent to (1,0) is in one of the other squares.\n\nI also notice that in row 2, there are flags at (2,0) and (2,3). Let me check if these flags are correctly placed without conflicting with the numbers. For example, the square at (2,0) is F, so it's flagged as a bomb. Let's see if any adjacent numbers are affected. The square above it, (1,0) is 1. So, if (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,0) should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0) is a bomb, that satisfies the '1' at (1,0). So that seems okay.\n\nSimilarly, the flag at (2,3) is F. Let's check the adjacent squares. The square above it is (1,3) which is 2. So, if (2,3) is a bomb, then (1,3) must have exactly two bombs adjacent. Let's see the adjacent squares to (1,3): (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). But (2,3) is a bomb, so that's one. Are there any other bombs nearby? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nNow, I need to check for any obvious conflicts. For example, if a '1' has two adjacent flags, that's a problem because it can only have one bomb. Similarly, if a '2' has only one flag and no other possible bombs, that could be a problem.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,8) is 1. Its adjacent squares are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). (1,8) is 1, so maybe the bomb is in (1,7) or (0,7). But (1,7) is '_', so it's revealed but empty. Wait, no: in the board, (1,7) is '_', which means it's been revealed and is empty. So, if (0,8) is 1, and (1,7) is empty, then the only possible bomb adjacent to (0,8) is (0,7) or (1,8). But (1,8) is 1, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. Therefore, the bomb must be at (0,7). But (0,7) is '.', meaning it's unexplored. So, that could be a bomb, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, but (0,7) is unexplored, so maybe I should consider revealing it to check. But I have to be careful not to reveal a bomb. Alternatively, maybe I can deduce it based on other information.\n\nLooking at row 1, (1,8) is 1. Its adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). We know (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2, (1,9) is 2, and (2,8) is 1, (2,9) is 2. So, for (1,8) being 1, there must be exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nIf I consider that (0,7) is a bomb, then (0,8) would have its required bomb, and (1,8) would also have that same bomb. But (1,8) is 1, so it can only have one bomb. If (0,7) is a bomb, then (1,8)'s count is satisfied, but what about (0,8)? It's also satisfied. So that could work.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me check other areas. Maybe there's a place where I can safely reveal a square without hitting a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 3, (3,0) is 1. Its adjacent squares include (2,0), which is F, so that's a bomb. Therefore, (3,0) being 1 is satisfied because it's adjacent to one bomb. So that's fine.\n\nIn row 4, (4,1) is 1. Its adjacent squares include (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0) is 1, which is a number, not a bomb. (4,0) is '_', which is empty. So, the bomb adjacent to (4,1) must be somewhere else. Maybe (5,1) is a bomb? Because (5,1) is 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Wait, no: (5,1) is 1, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. So, maybe the bomb is at (3,1) or (4,2). But (3,1) is 2, so it's a number, not a bomb. Hmm, perhaps (5,0) is a bomb? But (5,0) is '_', which is empty. So I'm a bit stuck here.\n\nMaybe I should look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which could help deduce where the bombs are. For example, in row 6, there are several F's: (6,0), (6,6), (6,8), (6,9). Let me check if these flags are correctly placed.\n\n(6,0) is F. Let's see the adjacent squares: (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). (5,0) is '_', which is empty. (5,1) is 1. So, if (6,0) is a bomb, then (5,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (6,0) is a bomb, that satisfies (5,1)'s count. So that seems okay.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is F. Its adjacent squares include (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,6) is 1, so if (6,6) is a bomb, then (5,6) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (6,6) is a bomb, that satisfies (5,6)'s count. So that seems okay too.\n\nNow, looking at row 7: (7,1) is 2, (7,2) is 2, (7,3) is 1, (7,4) is 1. Let me check these. For (7,1) being 2, the adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0) is a bomb, so that's one. Are there any other bombs adjacent? Maybe (6,2) is a bomb? But (6,2) is '.', so unexplored. Or maybe (8,1) is a bomb? But (8,1) is 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, (7,1) needs another bomb adjacent. Since (6,0) is already a bomb, perhaps (6,2) is another bomb. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at row 8: (8,1) is 1. Its adjacent squares include (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,1) is 2, which is a number, so not a bomb. (8,0) is '_', which is empty. So, the bomb adjacent to (8,1) must be elsewhere. Maybe (7,0) is a bomb? But (7,0) is '_', which is empty. Hmm, not sure.\n\nI think I need to find a square where revealing it won't result in a bomb and can help me get more information. Let's look for a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, which might give me clues.\n\nLooking at (9,1), which is 1. Its adjacent squares include (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,1) is 1, which is a number, so not a bomb. So, the bomb must be in one of the other squares. Maybe (9,0) or (9,2). But both are '.'.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (5,6) which is 1. Its adjacent squares include (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (6,6) is a bomb, so that satisfies (5,6)'s count. So that's fine.\n\nWait, maybe I can look for a square that's surrounded by numbers which can help me deduce its state. For example, if a square is adjacent to a '1' and a '2', maybe I can figure out if it's a bomb or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of flags left. There are 2 flags remaining, and there are 10 bombs in total. Let me count the current flags: in row 0, there's none; row 1 has none; row 2 has two F's at (2,0) and (2,3); row 3 none; row 4 none; row 5 none; row 6 has four F's at (6,0), (6,6), (6,8), (6,9); row 7 none; row 8 none; row 9 none. Wait, that's 2 (row 2) + 4 (row 6) = 6 flags. But the game info says flags remaining: 2. So, total flags placed are 10 - 2 = 8? Wait, no, the game info says flags remaining: 2, which means the player can place 2 more flags. So, total flags placed so far are 8, because there are 10 bombs. Wait, no: the total number of flags should equal the number of bombs, which is 10. So, if flags remaining are 2, the player has placed 8 flags already. Let me count again.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: no F's.\n\nRow 1: no F's.\n\nRow 2: F at (2,0) and (2,3) \u2192 2.\n\nRow 3: no F's.\n\nRow 4: no F's.\n\nRow 5: no F's.\n\nRow 6: F at (6,0), (6,6), (6,8), (6,9) \u2192 4.\n\nRow 7: no F's.\n\nRow 8: no F's.\n\nRow 9: no F's.\n\nTotal flags placed: 2 + 4 = 6. So, flags remaining: 10 - 6 = 4? But the game info says flags remaining: 2. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the board again.\n\nWait, looking back, the game info says flags remaining: 2, so the player can place 2 more flags. That means they've already placed 8 flags. But when I count the F's on the board, I see:\n\nRow 2: 2 F's.\n\nRow 6: 4 F's.\n\nThat's 6. So, where are the other 2? Maybe I missed some. Let me check each row again.\n\nRow 0: no F's.\n\nRow 1: no F's.\n\nRow 2: (2,0) and (2,3) \u2192 2.\n\nRow 3: no F's.\n\nRow 4: no F's.\n\nRow 5: no F's.\n\nRow 6: (6,0), (6,6), (6,8), (6,9) \u2192 4.\n\nRow 7: no F's.\n\nRow 8: no F's.\n\nRow 9: no F's.\n\nSo total is 6. Therefore, the game info must have a typo, or I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the flags remaining are 2, so the player has placed 8 flags. But I only see 6. Hmm, perhaps I need to proceed without worrying about that.\n\nNow, considering the remaining flags, I should be cautious about placing new flags without conflicting with the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 6, which has four F's. Let me check if these flags are correctly placed. For example, (6,0) is F. Let's see the adjacent squares: (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). (5,1) is 1, so if (6,0) is a bomb, that satisfies (5,1)'s count. So that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is F. Adjacent squares include (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,6) is 1, so if (6,6) is a bomb, that satisfies (5,6)'s count. So that's okay.\n\nNow, looking at (6,8) and (6,9), both F. Let's check their adjacent squares. (6,8) is adjacent to (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). (5,8) is 2, (5,9) is F. Wait, (5,9) is F? No, looking back, (5,9) is '.' according to the board. Wait, no: in row 5, the last column is '.'.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nRow 5: _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 F . \n\nWait, (5,8) is 2 and (5,9) is F? No, (5,8) is 2, (5,9) is '.'.\n\nSo, (6,8) is F, so it's a bomb. The adjacent square (5,8) is 2, so that means (5,8) must have exactly two bombs adjacent. Since (6,8) is a bomb, there must be another bomb adjacent to (5,8). Let's see the adjacent squares to (5,8): (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). (6,8) is a bomb, and (6,9) is F, which is another bomb. So, (5,8) is 2, which is satisfied by (6,8) and (6,9). So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (6,9) is F, so it's a bomb. The adjacent square (5,9) is '.', so it's unexplored. Also, (6,8) is a bomb, which is adjacent to (5,8), which is 2. So that's okay.\n\nNow, let's look for a square where I can safely reveal it. Maybe a square that's adjacent to a '1' which already has a flag, so revealing it would be safe.\n\nLooking at (0,7), which is '.'. If I reveal it, and if it's a bomb, the game ends. But if it's safe, I can get more info. Let me see if (0,7) is adjacent to any numbers that can help me.\n\n(0,7) is adjacent to (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,8) is 1, (1,7) is '_', (1,8) is 1. If (0,7) is a bomb, then (0,8) would have its count satisfied, but (1,7) is empty. But (1,8) is 1, which would require exactly one bomb adjacent. So, if (0,7) is a bomb, then (1,8)'s count is satisfied, but (0,8)'s count is also satisfied. But (1,7) is empty, so that's okay.\n\nBut I'm not sure if (0,7) is a bomb. Maybe I can find another square that's safer to reveal.\n\nLooking at (1,7), which is '_'. It's been revealed but is empty. Wait, no: in row 1, (1,7) is '_', which means it's been revealed and is empty. So, that's safe. But I can't reveal it again; I can only place a flag there, but that would be incorrect because it's already empty.\n\nWait, no: '_' is an empty revealed space, so I can't place a flag there. So, maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at (3,5), which is '_'. It's empty, so revealing it won't help, but maybe it's adjacent to numbers that can give me info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's adjacent to a '1' which already has a flag, making it safe to reveal.\n\nFor example, (3,0) is 1, and it's adjacent to (2,0), which is F. So, (3,0) is 1, which is satisfied by (2,0) being a bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares of (3,0) must be safe. So, (3,1) is 2, which is a number, so it's safe. (4,0) is '_', which is empty. So, maybe revealing (4,0) is safe because (3,0) is already satisfied by (2,0). But (4,0) is adjacent to (3,0), which is 1, so (4,0) can't be a bomb because (3,0) only has one bomb adjacent. Therefore, (4,0) must be safe. So, revealing (4,0) would be safe.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think: (3,0) is 1, which is adjacent to (2,0) F. So, (3,0) is satisfied. Therefore, the other squares adjacent to (3,0) cannot be bombs because (3,0) only has one bomb. So, (4,0) is adjacent to (3,0), which is 1, so (4,0) can't be a bomb. Therefore, revealing (4,0) is safe.\n\nSo, my next move could be to reveal (4,0). Let me check if that's a good move.\n\nBut wait, (4,0) is '_', which means it's already been revealed as empty. So, I can't reveal it again. I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back at the board, row 4: _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 . \n\nSo, (4,0) is '_', which is empty. So, I can't reveal it again. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at (5,0), which is '_', so it's empty. But (5,0) is adjacent to (6,0) F. So, (5,0) is safe because it's already empty.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (7,5), which is 1. Its adjacent squares include (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (6,6) is F, so that's a bomb. Therefore, (7,5) is 1, which is satisfied by (6,6). So, the other adjacent squares must be safe. Therefore, (7,5) is 1, so revealing any of its adjacent squares that aren't already numbers or flags should be safe.\n\nWait, (7,5) is 1, so it has exactly one bomb adjacent, which is (6,6). Therefore, the other adjacent squares must be safe. So, for example, (7,6) is '.', which is unexplored. Revealing (7,6) should be safe because it can't be a bomb, as (7,5) only has one bomb adjacent. So, revealing (7,6) would be safe.\n\nBut (7,6) is in row 7, column 6. Let me check the board: row 7 is _ 1 2 2 1 1 . . . . \n\nSo, (7,6) is '.'.\n\nTherefore, revealing (7,6) is safe because (7,5) is 1, which is already satisfied by (6,6). So, (7,6) can't be a bomb. So, I can safely reveal it.\n\nBut wait, (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). (6,6) is a bomb, so (7,5) is satisfied. Therefore, (7,6) is safe.\n\nSo, my next move could be to reveal (7,6). But I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, maybe I can find a better square to reveal.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (1,5), which is '_', so it's empty. But I can't reveal it again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a square that's adjacent to a '2' which already has one flag, so I can deduce where the other bomb is.\n\nFor example, (1,3) is 2. Its adjacent squares include (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (2,3) is F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, (1,3) needs another bomb adjacent. So, one of the other squares must be a bomb. Let's see: (0,3) is 4, which is a number, so not a bomb. (1,4) is 1, which is a number. (2,2) is '.', (2,4) is 1. So, the other bomb must be at (0,2) or (0,4) or (2,2) or (2,4).\n\nBut (0,2) is '.', (0,4) is 5, which is a number, so not a bomb. (2,2) is '.', (2,4) is 1, which is a number. So, the only possible square is (2,2). Therefore, (2,2) must be a bomb because (1,3) is 2 and already has one flag at (2,3). So, (2,2) must be the other bomb.\n\nWait, but (2,2) is '.', which means it's unexplored. So, if I can confirm that, I can place a flag there. But I can only place a flag if I'm sure. Alternatively, I can reveal it to check, but that's risky.\n\nBut according to the rules, I should only place a flag if I'm sure. Since (1,3) is 2 and already has one flag at (2,3), the other must be at (2,2). So, placing a flag at (2,2) would be correct.\n\nBut I have to make sure that placing a flag there doesn't conflict with other numbers. Let's check the adjacent squares of (2,2). The adjacent squares include (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1) is 1, (1,2) is 1, (1,3) is 2, (2,1) is '.', (2,3) is F, (3,1) is 2, (3,2) is F, (3,3) is 2.\n\nWait, (3,2) is F? No, looking back, row 3 is 1 2 F 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . \n\nSo, (3,2) is F. Therefore, if I place a flag at (2,2), then (3,2) is already F, which is a bomb. So, (3,2) being F (bomb) is adjacent to (2,2), which would be another bomb. But (3,2) is F, so it's a bomb, and (2,2) would be another bomb adjacent to it. But (3,2) is 2 in row 3, column 2? Wait, no: row 3, column 2 is F, which is a flag, not a number. Wait, no: the board shows row 3 as 1 2 F 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . So, (3,2) is F, which is a flag, meaning it's marked as a bomb. Therefore, if (2,2) is a bomb, then (3,2) is also a bomb, making them adjacent. But that's allowed because bombs can be adjacent. However, I need to check if any numbers are affected by this.\n\nLooking at (3,1) which is 2. Its adjacent squares include (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) is F, (2,2) would be F if I place a flag, (3,2) is F. So, (3,1) is 2, which would have three bombs adjacent: (2,0), (2,2), and (3,2). That's a problem because (3,1) is 2, but it would have three bombs adjacent. Therefore, placing a flag at (2,2) would conflict with (3,1)'s count of 2. So, that's not allowed.\n\nTherefore, my earlier deduction must be wrong. So, (1,3) is 2 with one flag at (2,3), so the other bomb must be somewhere else, but not at (2,2) because it would cause a conflict with (3,1).\n\nSo, perhaps the other bomb is at (0,2). Let me check: (0,2) is '.'. If I place a flag there, does it conflict with any numbers?\n\nThe adjacent squares to (0,2) include (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is '_', (0,3) is 4, (1,1) is 1, (1,2) is 1, (1,3) is 2.\n\nIf (0,2) is a bomb, then (1,2) is 1, which would have one bomb adjacent. But (1,2) is 1, so it can only have one bomb. If (0,2) is a bomb, that satisfies (1,2)'s count. So, that's okay.\n\nAlso, (0,3) is 4, which is a number. So, (0,2) being a bomb would contribute to (0,3)'s count. (0,3) is 4, so it needs four bombs adjacent. Let's see: the adjacent squares to (0,3) are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2) would be a bomb, (1,3) is 2, but that's a number, not a bomb. (1,4) is 1, which is a number. (0,4) is 5, which is a number. So, (0,3) is 4, but only (0,2) is a bomb. That's only one bomb, but it needs four. So, that's a problem. Therefore, (0,2) can't be a bomb because it would make (0,3)'s count incorrect.\n\nSo, that means the other bomb for (1,3) can't be at (0,2). Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me try again.\n\n(1,3) is 2, with one flag at (2,3). So, the other bomb must be somewhere else. Let's look at the adjacent squares again: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4). (0,3) is 4, (0,4) is 5, (1,2) is 1, (1,4) is 1, (2,2) is '.', (2,4) is 1.\n\nIf I consider (2,4) as a bomb, but it's a number, so that's not possible. So, the only remaining square is (0,2), but that causes a problem with (0,3). Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and (1,3) can't have another bomb adjacent without conflicting with other numbers. This suggests that maybe (2,3) isn't a bomb, but that can't be because it's flagged. So, perhaps I need to remove the flag at (2,3) because it's causing a conflict.\n\nWait, but according to the rules, if placing a new flag would conflict, I should consider removing an existing flag. So, maybe (2,3) isn't a bomb, and the flag there is incorrect. Therefore, I should remove the flag at (2,3) by making a move with flag=true on that square.\n\nBut before doing that, I need to check if that's the case. Let me see: if (2,3) isn't a bomb, then (1,3) is 2, which would need two bombs adjacent. But (2,3) is F, so if I remove that flag, (1,3) would need two bombs elsewhere. But where?\n\nThe adjacent squares to (1,3) are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4). If (2,3) isn't a bomb, then (1,3) needs two bombs in these squares. But (0,2) can't be a bomb because it would affect (0,3). (2,2) can't be a bomb because it would affect (3,1). So, perhaps (2,4) is a bomb, but it's a number. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for another square to reveal that's definitely safe. Let's go back to (7,6). As I thought earlier, revealing (7,6) is safe because (7,5) is 1, which is satisfied by (6,6). So, (7,6) can't be a bomb. So, revealing (7,6) would give me more information.\n\nSo, my next move would be to reveal (7,6). Let me write that down.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (7,6) is safe because (7,5) is 1, which is already satisfied by the flag at (6,6). Therefore, (7,6) cannot be a bomb and revealing it will provide more information about adjacent squares.\n\nMOVE: 7,6,false", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . 2\n2 F . .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 1, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current board state and the game info.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has 2 flags remaining. My goal is to either reveal a safe square or correctly flag a bomb without causing a conflict with the existing numbers.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice that some squares are already revealed with numbers, and some are flagged. I should check if any of the revealed numbers are conflicting with the current flags. For example, if a square with a '1' has two flags adjacent to it, that would be a problem because it can only have one bomb nearby.\n\nLet me go row by row to spot any obvious conflicts or opportunities.\n\nStarting with row 0: The last two squares are 1 and 2. Since they're at the edge, maybe they can help me figure out something about their neighbors.\n\nRow 1 has several numbers: 1s and a 2. The last square is a 2. Maybe the squares around it can give clues.\n\nRow 2 has two Fs (flags) and some numbers. I should check if the flags here are correctly placed. For instance, if a '1' is next to a flag, it should only have one bomb adjacent. If there's another flag nearby, that could be a problem.\n\nRow 3 has a 2, which might indicate two bombs around it. If I can find where those bombs might be, that could help.\n\nRow 4 has some 1s and a 2, and some empty squares. Maybe I can deduce something from the numbers here.\n\nRow 5 has a 1 and a 2 towards the end. The 2 might indicate two bombs nearby, so I should look around that area.\n\nRow 6 has several Fs and a 1. I need to make sure that the flags here don't conflict with the numbers.\n\nRow 7 has a 2 and some 1s. Maybe the 2 can help me find where another bomb is.\n\nRow 8 and 9 have some 1s and empty squares. Not much to go on there yet.\n\nI think I should focus on areas where the numbers can give me clear information. For example, if a square with a '1' has only one possible spot for a bomb, that might be a good place to flag. Alternatively, if a '2' has one flag already, I might need to place another flag nearby without conflicting.\n\nLooking at position (0,8) which is a 1. It's in the top row, so it only has a few adjacent squares. It's adjacent to (0,7) which is a 1, (1,7) which is a 1, and (1,8) which is a 2, and (0,9) which is an F. Wait, no, (0,9) is an F. So the square at (0,8) is a 1, meaning it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), and (1,8). (0,9) is an F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the 1 at (0,8) is satisfied because it's next to a flag. So no other bombs can be adjacent to (0,8). That means the squares around (0,8) other than (0,9) cannot have bombs. So (0,7), (1,7), and (1,8) must be safe. Wait, but (1,8) is a 2. So if (1,8) is a 2, it must have two bombs adjacent. But if (0,8) is a 1 and already has a flag at (0,9), then (1,8) can't have a bomb at (0,8) because that's already accounted for. So (1,8) must have two bombs elsewhere. Maybe that's something to consider.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a square that's a '1' and already has a flag adjacent, so I can eliminate possibilities. For example, (0,8) is a 1 and has a flag at (0,9). Therefore, the other adjacent squares cannot have bombs. So (0,7), (1,7), and (1,8) are safe. So (1,8) is a 2, but if (0,8) is a 1 with a flag, then (1,8) must have two bombs in its other adjacent squares.\n\nWait, let me map out the adjacent squares for (1,8). It's at row 1, column 8. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n(0,7), (0,8), (0,9),\n(1,7),        (1,9),\n(2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nWe know (0,8) is a 1, which is accounted for by the flag at (0,9). So (1,8) being a 2 must have two bombs in its adjacent squares. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the current board, (0,9) is an F, so that's one bomb. (1,9) is a 2, so that's another. Wait, (1,9) is a 2, meaning it has two bombs adjacent. But (1,9) is adjacent to (0,8), which is a 1, so (0,8) is already accounted for by (0,9). Therefore, (1,9) must have two bombs in its other adjacent squares. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that's a '1' and has only one possible spot for a bomb, which would be a good place to flag. Alternatively, if a '2' has one flag, I might need to place another.\n\nLooking at row 6, there's an F at (6,0), (6,7), and (6,9). Let me check the numbers around these flags to ensure they don't conflict.\n\nFor example, (6,0) is an F. The square above it is (5,0), which is a 1. So (5,0) is a 1, meaning it has one bomb adjacent. If (6,0) is a flag, that accounts for the bomb. So (5,0) is satisfied. But let's check other squares around (5,0). Its adjacent squares are (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1). (6,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other squares around (5,0) must be safe. So (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) are safe.\n\nWait, but (6,1) is a '.' so it's unexplored. Maybe I can reveal it since it's safe, but I don't know that for sure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (2,0) which is an F. The square above it is (1,0) which is a 1. So (1,0) is a 1, meaning it has one bomb adjacent. If (2,0) is a flag, that accounts for it. So (1,0) is satisfied. Let's check the other squares around (1,0). They are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (0,0) is '_', (0,1) is '_', (1,1) is a 1, (2,0) is F, (2,1) is '.'.\n\nSo (1,0) is a 1, and it's adjacent to a flag at (2,0), so the other squares around it must be safe. Therefore, (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1) are safe. But (1,1) is a 1, so it must have one bomb adjacent. Since (1,0) is a 1 and has a flag, (1,1) must have a bomb somewhere else. Its adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). We know (2,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb. Therefore, (1,1) is a 1, so it can't have any other bombs adjacent. So all other squares around (1,1) must be safe except (2,0). Therefore, (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) are safe.\n\nWait, but (0,2) is '_', so it's revealed as empty. That's fine.\n\nThis is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should look for a square that's a '1' with only one possible spot for a bomb, which would be a good flag candidate.\n\nLooking at (3,0) which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is an F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, (3,0) is a 1, so it can't have any other bombs adjacent. So the other squares around it must be safe. So (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1) are safe.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is a 2. Wait, no, (3,0) is a 1, and (3,1) is a 2. Wait, (3,1) is a 2, so it must have two bombs adjacent. Let me see. The adjacent squares for (3,1) are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). We know (2,0) is an F, so that's one bomb. So (3,1) being a 2 must have another bomb somewhere in its adjacent squares. Since (3,0) is a 1, and it's already accounted for by (2,0), the other squares around (3,1) must have another bomb.\n\nSo possible candidates are (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). But (3,0) is a 1, so (4,0) and (4,1) are safe because (3,0)'s other adjacent squares are safe. So the bomb must be in (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), or (4,2).\n\nWait, but (2,1) is a '.' so unexplored, (2,2) is a '.' as well. (3,2) is a '.' and (4,2) is a '.'.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at (5,5) which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (6,5) is a '.' and (6,6) is a '.'.\n\nBut I don't see any flags around here, so it's hard to tell. Maybe not the best place.\n\nLooking at (7,0) which is a '.' and (7,1) is a 1. (7,1) is a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent. Let's see its adjacent squares: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0) is an F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, (7,1) is a 1, so it can't have any other bombs adjacent. So the other squares must be safe. Therefore, (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2) are safe.\n\nWait, (6,1) is a '.' so maybe I can reveal it, but I don't know if it's safe. But according to this, it should be safe because (7,1) is a 1 and already has a flag at (6,0). So (6,1) must be safe. So I could reveal (6,1) safely.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Maybe I should look for a place where placing a flag would satisfy a '1' without conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (9,1) which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,1) is a 1, so it must have one bomb. But (9,1) is a 1 as well. So maybe they share a bomb. Wait, (8,1) is a 1, and (9,1) is a 1. They are adjacent, so perhaps they both have a bomb at (8,2) or (9,0) or something.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should consider that since there are 10 bombs and 2 flags left, I need to place flags carefully.\n\nLooking back at (0,9) which is an F, and (0,8) is a 1. That seems correct because (0,8) is a 1 and has a flag next to it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the existing flags are conflicting with the numbers. For example, if a '1' has two flags next to it, that's a conflict.\n\nLooking at (2,0) which is an F. The square (1,0) is a 1, which is correct because it has one flag. Similarly, (2,3) is an F. The square (2,4) is a 1, so it must have one bomb adjacent. Since (2,3) is an F, that accounts for it, so the other squares around (2,4) must be safe.\n\nWait, (2,4) is a 1, and it's adjacent to (2,3) which is an F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other squares around (2,4) must be safe. So (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) must be safe.\n\nBut (1,4) is a 1, so that's okay because (2,3) is the bomb. Wait, no, (1,4) is a 1, so it must have one bomb adjacent. Since (2,3) is a flag, that's the one. So (1,4) is satisfied.\n\nThis seems okay. So perhaps the flags are correctly placed.\n\nNow, considering the remaining flags, I have 2 left. I need to find where to place them without conflicting.\n\nLooking at row 6, there's an F at (6,0), (6,7), and (6,9). Let me check if these are conflicting.\n\nFor (6,0): adjacent squares include (5,0), which is a 1. Since (5,0) is a 1 and (6,0) is a flag, that's correct. So (5,0) is satisfied.\n\nFor (6,7): adjacent squares include (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). (6,8) is a 1, so it must have one bomb. (6,7) is a flag, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other squares around (6,8) must be safe. So (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8) must be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (6,9) is a flag. The square (6,8) is a 1, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other squares around (6,8) must be safe.\n\nWait, but (6,8) is a 1, and it's adjacent to (6,7) which is a flag and (6,9) which is a flag. That would mean (6,8) is a 1 but has two flags adjacent, which is a conflict because it can only have one bomb. So this is a problem.\n\nOh no, that's a conflict. So (6,8) is a 1, but it's adjacent to two flags at (6,7) and (6,9). That's a problem because a '1' can only have one bomb adjacent. Therefore, this is an invalid state. But wait, the game is still ongoing, so perhaps one of those flags is incorrect.\n\nBut in the current state, the player has 2 flags remaining, so they must have placed 8 flags already (since there are 10 bombs). Wait, no, the flags remaining are 2, meaning they've used 8 flags already. But the board shows several Fs, but I need to count them.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is F \u2192 1 F\n\nRow 1: (1,0) is 1, (1,9) is 2 \u2192 no F\n\nRow 2: (2,0) is F, (2,3) is F \u2192 2 Fs\n\nRow 3: no Fs\n\nRow 4: no Fs\n\nRow 5: no Fs\n\nRow 6: (6,0) F, (6,7) F, (6,9) F \u2192 3 Fs\n\nRow 7: no Fs\n\nRow 8: no Fs\n\nRow 9: no Fs\n\nSo total Fs: 1 (row0) + 2 (row2) + 3 (row6) = 6 Fs. But the game info says flags remaining: 2, which implies total flags placed are 8 (since 10 bombs - 2 remaining = 8 placed). But according to the board, only 6 Fs are present. So there's a discrepancy here. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) \u2192 1\n\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,3) \u2192 2\n\nRow 6: (6,0), (6,7), (6,9) \u2192 3\n\nTotal: 1+2+3=6. So the player has placed 6 flags, with 4 remaining (since 10-6=4, but game info says 2 remaining). Hmm, perhaps the game info is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the game info says flags remaining: 2, meaning the player can place 2 more flags, having already placed 8. But the board only shows 6 Fs, so that's confusing. Maybe I should proceed as if the game info is correct, and the player has 2 flags left to place.\n\nBut back to the conflict: (6,8) is a 1, but adjacent to two Fs at (6,7) and (6,9). That's a conflict because a '1' can only have one bomb adjacent. Therefore, one of those flags must be incorrect. So the player needs to remove one of those flags.\n\nBut according to the rules, to remove a flag, the player must make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So the next move could be to remove a flag from either (6,7) or (6,9).\n\nWhich one to remove? Let's see.\n\nIf we remove (6,7), then (6,8) is a 1, so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The other adjacent squares would need to have one bomb. Alternatively, if we remove (6,9), same logic.\n\nBut perhaps (6,7) is causing more issues. Let's check the squares around (6,7). It's a flag, so the adjacent squares must have bombs accounted for.\n\nThe square (5,6) is a 1. It's adjacent to (6,7) which is a flag. So (5,6) is a 1, which is satisfied by the flag at (6,7). Therefore, the other squares around (5,6) must be safe. So (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) are safe except for (6,7). So if we remove the flag at (6,7), (5,6) would no longer have a bomb adjacent, which would be a problem because it's a '1' and would have zero bombs, which is invalid. Therefore, removing (6,7) would cause a conflict with (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, if we remove (6,9), let's see the impact. The square (5,8) is a 2. It's adjacent to (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). If we remove (6,9), then (5,8) is a 2, so it must have two bombs adjacent. Currently, (6,7) is a flag, so that's one. If we remove (6,9), then (5,8) must have another bomb somewhere else. But (5,8) is a 2, so it needs two bombs. If (6,7) is still a flag, then (5,8) would have one bomb, which is insufficient. Therefore, removing (6,9) would also cause a problem because (5,8) is a 2 and would only have one bomb.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe the better move is to remove one of the conflicting flags to resolve the issue. Since both (6,7) and (6,9) are causing conflicts, perhaps the correct move is to remove one of them.\n\nBut which one? Let's see.\n\nIf I remove (6,9), then (6,8) is a 1, which would only have (6,7) as a flag, satisfying it. But (5,8) is a 2, which would then have only one bomb at (6,7), which is insufficient. So (5,8) would need another bomb, which would have to be elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, if I remove (6,7), then (6,8) is a 1 with only (6,9) as a flag, which is okay. But (5,6) is a 1 that was relying on (6,7) as a flag. So removing (6,7) would make (5,6) have zero bombs, which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the better option might be to remove (6,9). Even though it causes (5,8) to have only one bomb, perhaps there's another bomb adjacent to (5,8) that I'm not seeing.\n\nWait, (5,8) is a 2, so it needs two bombs. If (6,7) is a flag, that's one. If (6,9) is removed, then (5,8) needs another bomb. The adjacent squares to (5,8) are (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). If (6,9) is removed, then (5,8) must have another bomb. So perhaps (4,8) or (5,7) is a bomb.\n\nBut (5,7) is a '.' so unexplored. If I remove (6,9), I can then check if (5,8) is still valid, but it's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that can give me more information. For example, revealing (6,1) which I thought was safe because (7,1) is a 1 and already has a flag at (6,0). So (6,1) should be safe.\n\nIf I reveal (6,1), and it's safe, that could help me figure out more about the surrounding squares.\n\nSo, the move would be to reveal (6,1). Let me check again: (7,1) is a 1, adjacent to (6,0) which is a flag. Therefore, (7,1) is satisfied, and (6,1) must be safe.\n\nSo the move would be to reveal (6,1), flag=false.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for another square.\n\nWait, another approach: since there are 10 bombs and 2 flags left, I have to find 8 more bombs, but I can only flag 2. So I need to reveal as many safe squares as possible.\n\nLooking at (5,5) which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). None of these are flags, so it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (9,1) which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,1) is a 1, so it must have one bomb. If I can find where that bomb is, maybe I can flag it.\n\nBut without more info, it's hard.\n\nI think the safest move is to reveal (6,1) because I believe it's safe based on (7,1) being a 1 with a flag at (6,0). So I'll make that move.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (6,1) because it's adjacent to a '1' at (7,1) which already has a flag at (6,0), indicating (6,1) is safe.\nMOVE: 6,1,false", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . 2\n2 F . .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 3, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let's see, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has already placed some flags, and there are 2 flags remaining. My goal is to decide whether to place a flag or reveal a tile, and where.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the board state and see if any numbers are conflicting with the current flags. Let me go row by row.\n\nLooking at row 0, I see a 1 at (0,8) and a 2 at (0,9). Since (0,9) is flagged as F, that might be a problem. The 1 at (0,8) indicates there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. If (0,9) is a flag, then (0,8)'s bomb count is already satisfied. But wait, (0,9) is flagged, so that should be a bomb. But let me check if that makes sense.\n\nWait, no. The flag is just a flag; it's not necessarily a bomb yet. The player has placed flags on squares they think are bombs. So, I need to check if any of the revealed numbers are conflicting with the flags.\n\nLooking at row 1, I see a 1 at (1,0), which is revealed. It has adjacent squares, but I'm not sure if any flags are next to it. The 1 at (1,0) should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Let me check the surrounding squares. To the right is (1,1), which is 1, and below is (2,0), which is F. So, the 1 at (1,0) has a flag at (2,0). That means the bomb count is satisfied, so no other bombs can be adjacent. Therefore, the other adjacent squares around (1,0) should not have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, looking at row 2, there's an F at (2,0). The 1 at (1,0) is next to this flag, so that's consistent. But I need to make sure that the flag at (2,0) is correct. If (2,0) is a bomb, then the adjacent numbers should reflect that. Let's check the numbers around (2,0). The square above is (1,0) with a 1, which is fine because it's already accounted for. To the right of (2,0) is (2,1), which is a dot, so unexplored. Below (2,0) is (3,0) with a 1. So, if (2,0) is a bomb, then (3,0) should have at least one bomb adjacent. But (3,0) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (2,0) is a bomb, then (3,0)'s count is satisfied, so the other adjacent squares around (3,0) shouldn't have bombs.\n\nWait, but (3,0) is a 1, so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. If (2,0) is a bomb, then (3,0) is satisfied. So, that seems okay. But I need to make sure that placing a flag at (2,0) doesn't conflict with any other numbers.\n\nNow, looking at row 6, there are flags at (6,0) and (6,8) and (6,9). Wait, no, looking at the board, row 6 has F at (6,0), (6,8) is F, and (6,9) is F. Wait, that's three flags, but the game info says flags remaining are 2. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 0: ...1 2 F (so (0,8)=1, (0,9)=2, and (0,9) is F? Wait, the board state is:\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n\nWait, no, the 0th row is:\n\n0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n\nSo, (0,8)=1, (0,9)=2, and (0,9) is F? Or is the F at (0,9)? Wait, the way it's written is:\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n\nSo, the 9th column (index 9) is F. So, (0,9) is F. Similarly, row 6:\n\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 . F 1 F\n\nSo, (6,0)=F, (6,8)=F, and (6,9)=F. That's three flags. But the game info says flags remaining: 2. So, the total flags placed so far should be 10 (total bombs) minus flags remaining (2), so 8 flags placed. But in the board, I count:\n\nRow 0: (0,9)=F \u2192 1\n\nRow 1: no F's.\n\nRow 2: (2,0)=F \u2192 1\n\nRow 3: no F's.\n\nRow 4: no F's.\n\nRow 5: no F's.\n\nRow 6: (6,0), (6,8), (6,9) \u2192 3\n\nRow 7: no F's.\n\nRow 8: no F's.\n\nRow 9: no F's.\n\nTotal flags: 1+1+3=5. But the game info says flags remaining: 2, so total placed should be 10-2=8. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: columns 8,9,10? Wait, the board is 10x10, so columns 0-9. So row 0 has at column 9: F. So that's 1.\n\nRow 1: no F's.\n\nRow 2: column 0: F \u2192 1.\n\nRow 3: no F's.\n\nRow 4: no F's.\n\nRow 5: no F's.\n\nRow 6: columns 0,8,9: F \u2192 3.\n\nRow 7: no F's.\n\nRow 8: no F's.\n\nRow 9: no F's.\n\nTotal flags: 1+1+3=5. So, the game info says flags remaining:2, so total placed should be 10-2=8. Therefore, I must have miscounted. Maybe row 6 has only two F's? Let me check the board state again.\n\nRow 6: F _ _ _ _ 1 . F 1 F\n\nSo, columns 0,8,9: F. So that's three. Hmm, perhaps the game info is incorrect, but I have to go with the given info. So, assuming that the flags remaining are 2, and total bombs are 10, so flags placed should be 8. But I count 5. Maybe I'm missing some.\n\nWait, maybe row 2 has another F? Let me check row 2:\n\n2 F . . F 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n\nSo, columns 0 and 4: F \u2192 2.\n\nSo, row 2: 2 F's.\n\nRow 0:1, row2:2, row6:3 \u2192 total 6. Still not 8. Maybe row 9 has some? No, row9 has none. Hmm, perhaps the initial analysis is wrong, but I'll proceed.\n\nAnyway, the main point is that I have to place flags carefully, considering the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,9) is F. The square to its left is (0,8)=1. So, the 1 at (0,8) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (0,9) is F, that satisfies the count. So, the other adjacent squares around (0,8) should not have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, looking at row 1, (1,0)=1. It has a flag at (2,0), so that's the one bomb it needs. So, the other adjacent squares around (1,0) should not have bombs.\n\nNow, looking at row 6, there are multiple F's. Let's check if any of them conflict with the numbers.\n\nFor example, (6,0) is F. The square above it is (5,0), which is _, meaning revealed but empty. The square to the right is (6,1)=_. The square below is (7,0)=_. The square diagonally up-right is (5,1)=1. So, the 1 at (5,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. If (6,0) is a bomb, then (5,1) is satisfied. But I need to check if there are other possible bombs around (5,1).\n\nLooking at (5,1)=1. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n(4,0)=_, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=., (5,0)=_, (5,2)=1, (6,0)=F, (6,1)=_, (6,2)=_.\n\nSo, (5,1) has a flag at (6,0). So, that's one bomb. It can't have any other bombs adjacent. Therefore, the other squares around (5,1) should not have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (6,8)=F. The square above is (5,8)=2, and to the left is (6,7)=., and below is (7,8)=., and right is (6,9)=F. So, (5,8)=2 must have exactly two bombs adjacent. Since (6,8) is F, that's one bomb. So, there must be another bomb adjacent to (5,8). Let's see where that could be.\n\nThe adjacent squares to (5,8) are:\n\n(4,7)=., (4,8)=1, (4,9)=., (5,7)=., (5,9)=., (6,7)=., (6,8)=F, (6,9)=F.\n\nWait, (5,8) is 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. It already has (6,8)=F and (6,9)=F, which are two bombs. So, that's correct. So, (5,8)=2 is satisfied by the two flags at (6,8) and (6,9). Therefore, those flags are correctly placed.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (6,9)=F. The square above is (5,9)=., and to the left is (6,8)=F. So, (5,9) is unexplored, but since (5,8)=2 is already satisfied by (6,8) and (6,9), (5,9) shouldn't have a bomb.\n\nNow, looking at row 2, (2,4)=F. Let's check the numbers around it.\n\nThe square above is (1,4)=1, and to the right is (2,5)=1. So, (1,4)=1 must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,4)=F, that satisfies it. Similarly, (2,5)=1 must have exactly one bomb adjacent. So, the other squares around (2,5) shouldn't have bombs.\n\nLooking at (2,5)=1. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n(1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=., (2,4)=F, (2,6)=., (3,4)=1, (3,5)=., (3,6)=., etc.\n\nSo, (2,5) has a flag at (2,4). So, that's one bomb. It can't have any other bombs adjacent. So, the other squares around (2,5) shouldn't have bombs.\n\nLooking at row 3, (3,0)=1. It has a flag at (2,0). So, that's one bomb. The other squares around (3,0) shouldn't have bombs.\n\nNow, looking for other potential conflicts. Let's check row 9, (9,1)=1. Its adjacent squares:\n\n(8,0)=., (8,1)=1, (8,2)=., (9,0)=., (9,2)=., etc.\n\nSo, (9,1)=1 needs exactly one bomb adjacent. Let's see if any flags are nearby. The only nearby flag is (6,0), which is far away. So, maybe there's a bomb somewhere else near (9,1).\n\nBut I don't have enough info yet. Let me look for other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 7, (7,0)=_. It's adjacent to (6,0)=F. So, (7,0) is empty, but it's next to a flag. So, it's safe.\n\nLooking at row 8, (8,1)=1. It needs exactly one bomb adjacent. Let's check its adjacent squares:\n\n(7,0)=., (7,1)=2, (7,2)=2, (8,0)=., (8,2)=., (9,0)=., (9,1)=1, (9,2)=.\n\nSo, (8,1)=1 has a flag at (6,0)? No, that's too far. Wait, (6,0) is far from (8,1). So, the bomb must be somewhere else.\n\nLooking at (7,1)=2 and (7,2)=2. Let's check (7,1)=2. It needs two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent squares:\n\n(6,0)=F, (6,1)=., (6,2)=., (7,0)=., (7,2)=2, (8,0)=., (8,1)=1, (8,2)=.\n\nSo, (7,1)=2 has one flag at (6,0). So, it needs another bomb. Therefore, one of the adjacent squares must have another bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (7,2)=2 needs two bombs adjacent. It has (6,2)=., (6,3)=., (7,1)=2, (7,3)=1, (8,1)=1, (8,2)=., (8,3)=.\n\nSo, (7,2)=2 needs two bombs. It doesn't have any flags adjacent yet, so both bombs must be in the unexplored squares.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a square where placing a flag would satisfy a number, or where revealing would give more info.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,8)=1. It's adjacent to (0,9)=F, which is a flag. So, that's correct. The other adjacent squares shouldn't have bombs.\n\nLooking at row 1, (1,0)=1. It's adjacent to (2,0)=F, which is correct.\n\nLooking at row 2, (2,0)=F and (2,4)=F. Both seem correctly placed based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 6, the three F's at (6,0), (6,8), (6,9) seem to satisfy the numbers around them.\n\nNow, looking for a square to reveal that would give maximum information. Maybe a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers.\n\nLooking at (5,1)=1. It's adjacent to (6,0)=F, so that's the one bomb. Therefore, the other squares around (5,1) shouldn't have bombs. So, (5,0), (5,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (6,1), (6,2) shouldn't have bombs.\n\nBut (5,1)=1 is already satisfied by (6,0)=F. So, revealing (5,0) or (5,2) might be safe, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, (3,0)=1. It's adjacent to (2,0)=F. So, the other squares around (3,0) shouldn't have bombs. So, (3,1) is 2, which needs two bombs. Wait, (3,1)=2? Let me check.\n\nRow 3: _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n\nSo, (3,1)=1? Wait, the row is:\n\n3 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n\nSo, (3,1)=1. It needs exactly one bomb adjacent. It's adjacent to (2,0)=F, which is a bomb. So, that's correct. Therefore, the other squares around (3,1) shouldn't have bombs.\n\nWait, but (3,1)=1 is adjacent to (2,0)=F, so it's satisfied. So, the other squares around (3,1) shouldn't have bombs.\n\nBut (3,3)=1, which is in row 3, column 3. It's 1, so it needs one bomb adjacent. Let's see where that could be.\n\nAdjacent squares to (3,3):\n\n(2,2)=., (2,3)=F, (2,4)=F, (3,2)=., (3,4)=., (4,2)=., (4,3)=1, (4,4)=.\n\nSo, (3,3)=1 is adjacent to (2,3)=F and (2,4)=F. That's two flags, but it's a 1. That's a problem because a 1 can't have two bombs adjacent. So, this is a conflict.\n\nWait, (3,3)=1 is adjacent to (2,3)=F and (2,4)=F. That would mean two bombs, but (3,3) is a 1, which can only have one. So, this is a conflict. Therefore, either (2,3) or (2,4) is not a bomb, which means one of the flags is incorrect.\n\nThis is a critical conflict. So, the flags at (2,3) and (2,4) can't both be bombs because (3,3)=1 can only have one bomb adjacent.\n\nTherefore, one of those flags is incorrectly placed. Since the player has only 2 flags remaining, they might want to remove one of these flags.\n\nSo, the options are to remove either (2,3) or (2,4). Let's see which one makes more sense.\n\nLooking at (2,3)=F. It's adjacent to (3,3)=1, which can only have one bomb. So, if (2,3) is a bomb, then (3,3)'s count is satisfied. But (2,3) is also adjacent to (1,3)=2. Let's check (1,3)=2.\n\n(1,3)=2 needs two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent squares:\n\n(0,2)=., (0,3)=., (0,4)=., (1,2)=1, (1,4)=1, (2,2)=., (2,3)=F, (2,4)=F.\n\nSo, (1,3)=2 has two flags adjacent: (2,3) and (2,4). That's two bombs, which satisfies the 2. So, (1,3)=2 is okay.\n\nBut (3,3)=1 can't have both (2,3) and (2,4) as bombs. Therefore, one of them must not be a bomb. So, one of the flags is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (2,4)=F. It's adjacent to (3,4)=., which is 1 in row 3, column 4. Wait, row 3, column 4 is _, not 1. Wait, row 3 is:\n\n3 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n\nSo, (3,4)=_. Hmm. So, (2,4)=F is adjacent to (3,4)=_, which is unexplored. Also, (2,4) is adjacent to (1,4)=1, which is satisfied by (2,4)=F.\n\nWait, (1,4)=1 is adjacent to (2,4)=F, which is correct. So, (1,4)=1 is satisfied.\n\nBut back to (3,3)=1. It's adjacent to (2,3)=F and (2,4)=F. So, that's two bombs, which is a conflict.\n\nTherefore, one of those flags must be removed. Since both are in row 2, columns 3 and 4.\n\nWhich one to remove? Let's see.\n\nIf we remove (2,3)=F, then (3,3)=1 would only have (2,4)=F as a bomb, which is correct. But then, (1,3)=2 would only have (2,4)=F as a bomb, which would leave it needing another bomb. So, (1,3)=2 would require another bomb adjacent, which would have to be in one of its other adjacent squares.\n\nAlternatively, if we remove (2,4)=F, then (3,3)=1 would only have (2,3)=F, which is correct. Also, (1,4)=1 would no longer have a bomb adjacent, which is a problem because (1,4)=1 needs exactly one bomb. So, (1,4)=1 would need another bomb adjacent if (2,4) is not a bomb.\n\nTherefore, removing (2,4)=F would cause (1,4)=1 to have no bombs adjacent, which is a conflict because it needs one. So, that's worse.\n\nTherefore, it's better to remove (2,3)=F. Because then:\n\n- (3,3)=1 is satisfied by (2,4)=F.\n\n- (1,3)=2 would have only (2,4)=F as a bomb, so it needs another bomb adjacent. So, one of the other squares around (1,3) must have a bomb.\n\nLooking at (1,3)=2, its adjacent squares are:\n\n(0,2)=., (0,3)=., (0,4)=., (1,2)=1, (1,4)=1, (2,2)=., (2,3)= (was F, now removed), (2,4)=F.\n\nSo, (1,3)=2 now has only (2,4)=F as a bomb. Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent. The only other possible square is (0,3)=., but that's in row 0, which is mostly unexplored. Alternatively, (0,4)=., but that's also unexplored.\n\nBut (1,2)=1 and (1,4)=1 are both 1's, which are satisfied by their own flags or other bombs.\n\nWait, (1,2)=1 is adjacent to (2,2)=., which is unexplored. So, if (1,2)=1 is satisfied, it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. If (2,2) is a bomb, then (1,2) is satisfied. But if (2,3) is not a bomb, then (1,3)=2 needs another bomb.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but the key point is that there's a conflict at (3,3)=1 due to two flags adjacent. So, one of the flags must be removed.\n\nSince the player has 2 flags remaining, they might want to remove a flag to correct this conflict.\n\nSo, the next move should be to remove one of the conflicting flags. Let's choose to remove (2,3)=F.\n\nTherefore, the move would be to set flag=true on (2,3), but since it's already flagged, setting flag=true would remove it.\n\nWait, according to the rules, to remove a flag, you make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\n\nSo, the move would be x=2, y=3, flag=true.\n\nBut wait, the current state of (2,3) is F. So, to remove the flag, you send flag=true.\n\nAlternatively, if the player wants to place a new flag, but in this case, the problem is that the existing flags are causing a conflict, so the solution is to remove one.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be to remove the flag at (2,3).\n\nSo, the explanation is that the flag at (2,3) is causing a conflict with (3,3)=1, which can only have one bomb adjacent. By removing this flag, we resolve the conflict.\n\nSo, the move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: Remove the flag at (2,3) because it causes a conflict with the number at (3,3)=1, which can only have one adjacent bomb.\n\nMOVE: 2,3,true\n</think>\n\nTo resolve the conflict where the number at (3,3) indicates only one adjacent bomb, but both (2,3) and (2,4) are flagged, we must remove one flag. Removing (2,3) resolves the conflict without causing issues elsewhere.\n\nEXPLANATION: Remove the flag at (2,3) to resolve conflict with (3,3)=1.\nMOVE: 2,3,true", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . 2\n2 F . .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 7, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has 3 flags remaining. My goal is to either reveal a tile or place a flag, but I have to be careful not to reveal a bomb, which would end the game.\n\nLooking at the board, I see several numbers and some flagged tiles (marked as F). I'll start by checking the revealed numbers to see if any of them have conflicting flags nearby. According to the critical flag placement rules, each number must have exactly the number of bombs adjacent to it as indicated. So, for example, a '1' must have exactly one bomb in the surrounding eight tiles, no more, no less.\n\nLet me go row by row to spot any obvious conflicts or opportunities.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- At (0,8) there's a 1, and (0,9) is an F. So, the '1' at (0,8) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The F at (0,9) is one bomb, so that's accounted for. But I should check if there are any other bombs adjacent to (0,8) that might conflict. The tiles around (0,8) are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). (0,7) is a 2, which I'll check later. (1,7) is _, (1,8) is 1, and (1,9) is 2. So, (0,8)'s bomb is at (0,9), so that's fine.\n\nMoving to row 1:\n- (1,0) is 1. The adjacent tiles are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (0,0) is _, (0,1) is _, (1,1) is 1, (2,0) is F, (2,1) is _. So, the '1' at (1,0) has a flag at (2,0), which counts as one bomb. So that's okay, but I should make sure no other bombs are adjacent. The other tiles around (1,0) are empty or unexplored, so that seems okay.\n\n- (1,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). We know (2,0) is F, so that's one bomb. So, the '1' at (1,1) is satisfied by that flag. So, no conflict there.\n\n- (1,4) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (0,3) is _, (0,4) is _, (0,5) is _, (1,3) is 2, (1,5) is 1, (2,3) is F, (2,4) is 1, (2,5) is _. So, the '1' at (1,4) has a flag at (2,3). So that's one bomb, which is correct. So, no conflict here.\n\n- (1,8) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). (0,7) is 2, (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is F, (1,7) is _, (1,9) is 2, (2,7) is _, (2,8) is 1, (2,9) is 2. So, the '1' at (1,8) has a flag at (0,9). So that's one bomb, which is correct.\n\n- (1,9) is 2. Adjacent tiles: (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9). (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is F, (1,8) is 1, (2,8) is 1, (2,9) is 2. So, the '2' at (1,9) has one flag at (0,9), so there must be another bomb adjacent. Let's see: Are there any other bombs around here? (2,9) is 2, which might indicate another bomb nearby, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should check if there's a conflict here later.\n\nRow 2:\n- (2,0) is F. So that's one bomb placed.\n- (2,3) is F. Another bomb placed.\n- (2,8) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). (1,7) is _, (1,8) is 1, (1,9) is 2, (2,7) is _, (2,9) is 2, (3,7) is _, (3,8) is 1, (3,9) is _. So, the '1' at (2,8) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (2,3) is F, but that's not adjacent to (2,8). Wait, (2,3) is F, but (2,8) is in row 2, column 8. So, the adjacent tiles are in row 1,2,3 and columns 7,8,9. So, (2,3) is column 3, which is far away. So, the '1' at (2,8) must have one bomb in its adjacent tiles. Are there any flags nearby? No, except (2,0) and (2,3), which are not adjacent. So, the '1' at (2,8) must have exactly one bomb in its vicinity. Maybe that's a place to consider revealing, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nRow 3:\n- (3,0) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is F, so that's one bomb, which satisfies the '1' at (3,0). So, no conflict.\n\n- (3,3) is 2. Adjacent tiles: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,3) is F, so that's one bomb. So, the '2' at (3,3) needs another bomb adjacent. Let's see if there are any other bombs nearby. (2,2) is _, (2,4) is 1, (3,2) is _, (3,4) is _, (4,2) is _, (4,3) is 1, (4,4) is _. So, the only bomb is at (2,3). Therefore, the '2' at (3,3) must have another bomb nearby. Maybe (4,3) is 1, which could have a bomb adjacent, but not necessarily here. Hmm, perhaps I should look elsewhere.\n\nRow 4:\n- (4,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is _, (3,2) is _, (4,0) is _, (4,2) is _, (5,0) is _, (5,1) is 1, (5,2) is 1. So, the '1' at (4,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. There are no flags nearby except (2,0) and (2,3), which are not adjacent. So, perhaps the bomb is somewhere around here, but I'm not sure.\n\nRow 5:\n- (5,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,0) is _, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is _, (5,0) is _, (5,2) is 1, (6,0) is F, (6,1) is _, (6,2) is _. So, the '1' at (5,1) has a flag at (6,0), which is one bomb. So that's correct.\n\n- (5,5) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (4,4) is _, (4,5) is _, (4,6) is _, (5,4) is _, (5,6) is 1, (6,4) is _, (6,5) is _, (6,6) is F. So, the '1' at (5,5) has a flag at (6,6). So that's one bomb, which is correct.\n\nRow 6:\n- (6,0) is F. So that's another flag.\n- (6,6) is F. Another flag.\n- (6,9) is F. Wait, but the board only allows 3 flags remaining. Let me check: the initial flags are at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (6,0), (6,6), (6,9). Wait, that's six flags, but the game info says flags remaining: 3. So, the player has placed some flags already, and can place 3 more. Wait, no, the game info says \"Flags remaining: 3\", which probably means the player has 3 flags left to place. So, the current flags on the board are at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (6,0), (6,6), (6,9). That's six flags, but the player can only place 10 bombs total, and has 3 flags remaining. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The game info says \"Flags remaining: 3\", which likely means the player has 3 flags left to place, having already placed some. So, the current flags on the board are more than 3, which might indicate a problem. Wait, no, in Minesweeper, the number of flags is equal to the number of bombs, which is 10 here. So, the player can place up to 10 flags, but has 3 remaining, meaning they've already placed 7 flags. But looking at the board, I count six F's. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) is F \u2192 1\nRow 1: no F's\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,3) \u2192 2 more \u2192 total 3\nRow 3: no F's\nRow 4: no F's\nRow 5: no F's\nRow 6: (6,0), (6,6), (6,9) \u2192 3 more \u2192 total 6\nRow 7: no F's\nRow 8: no F's\nRow 9: no F's\n\nSo, total flags placed: 6. But the game info says \"Flags remaining: 3\", so the player has 3 left to place, meaning they've used 7 flags. Wait, that doesn't add up because I count 6. Maybe I missed one. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) is F \u2192 1\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,3) \u2192 2 \u2192 total 3\nRow 6: (6,0), (6,6), (6,9) \u2192 3 \u2192 total 6\n\nThat's 6 flags. So, the game info says \"Flags remaining: 3\", which would mean the player has placed 7 flags. So, perhaps I missed one. Let me check row 9 again. No, row 9 has none. Maybe row 7? No. Hmm, perhaps the initial count was wrong. Maybe the game info is correct, and I need to proceed with 3 flags remaining.\n\nAnyway, moving on.\n\nRow 6:\n- (6,0) is F.\n- (6,6) is F.\n- (6,9) is F.\n\nSo, three flags in row 6.\n\nLooking at (6,6) which is F. Let's check the adjacent tiles for any numbers that might conflict. The tile at (5,5) is 1, which is adjacent to (6,6). So, the '1' at (5,5) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (6,6) is F, that's one bomb. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (6,9) is F. The adjacent tiles include (5,8) which is 2, but (5,8) is not a number, it's _. Wait, (5,9) is . So, perhaps no conflict there.\n\nRow 7:\n- (7,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0) is F, so that's one bomb, satisfying the '1' at (7,1). So, correct.\n\n- (7,4) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). (6,4) is _, (6,5) is _, (7,3) is 2, (7,5) is 1, (8,3) is _, (8,4) is _, (8,5) is _. So, the '1' at (7,4) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. There are no flags nearby except (6,0), which is not adjacent. So, perhaps the bomb is somewhere around here, but I'm not sure.\n\nRow 8:\n- (8,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,0) is _, (7,1) is 1, (7,2) is _, (8,0) is _, (8,2) is _, (9,0) is _, (9,1) is _, (9,2) is _. So, the '1' at (8,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. There are no flags nearby, so the bomb must be somewhere in the adjacent tiles, but I don't know where yet.\n\nRow 9:\n- (9,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,0) is _, (8,1) is 1, (8,2) is _, (9,0) is _, (9,2) is _. So, the '1' at (9,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Again, no flags nearby, so the bomb is somewhere around.\n\nNow, I need to look for any obvious conflicts. Let's check the '2' at (1,9). It's adjacent to (0,9) which is F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (1,9). Let's see the adjacent tiles: (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9). (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is F, (1,8) is 1, (2,8) is 1, (2,9) is 2. So, the '2' at (1,9) must have another bomb besides (0,9). So, one of the adjacent tiles must be a bomb. Let's see:\n\n- (0,8) is 1, which can't be a bomb because it's a number.\n- (1,8) is 1, same.\n- (2,8) is 1, same.\n- (2,9) is 2, which is a number.\n\nSo, the only possibility is that (1,7) is a bomb, but (1,7) is _, and (1,9) is 2, so the other bomb must be at (1,7) or (2,7). Wait, but (1,7) is adjacent to (1,9), so if (1,7) is a bomb, that would satisfy the '2' at (1,9). Alternatively, (2,7) could be a bomb, but that's adjacent to (2,8) which is 1, so that would conflict because (2,8) is 1, meaning only one bomb adjacent. If (2,7) were a bomb, then (2,8) would have two bombs adjacent: (2,7) and (2,3). Wait, (2,3) is F, which is a bomb. So, (2,8) is 1, which is adjacent to (2,7) and (2,3). So, if (2,7) is a bomb, then (2,8) would have two bombs adjacent, which would make the '1' at (2,8) incorrect. Therefore, (2,7) cannot be a bomb because that would conflict with (2,8) being 1. Therefore, the other bomb for (1,9) must be at (1,7). So, (1,7) must be a bomb. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nIf (1,7) is a bomb, then let's see the adjacent tiles for other numbers. For example, (1,6) is _, (1,8) is 1, (0,6) is _, (0,7) is 2, (2,6) is _, (2,7) is _, (2,8) is 1. Wait, (0,7) is 2. If (1,7) is a bomb, then (0,7) is adjacent to it, so (0,7) would have at least one bomb. But (0,7) is 2, which is correct because (0,9) is F, which is another bomb adjacent to (0,7). Wait, no, (0,7) is in row 0, column 7. Its adjacent tiles include (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). If (1,7) is a bomb, then (0,7) would have two bombs adjacent: (1,7) and (0,9). Wait, no, (0,9) is in column 9, which is not adjacent to (0,7). So, (0,7) is 2, which would require two bombs adjacent. If (1,7) is a bomb, that's one. Are there any others? Let's see: (0,8) is 1, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (1,6) is _, (1,8) is 1, (2,7) is _, (2,6) is _, (2,8) is 1. So, only (1,7) is a bomb adjacent to (0,7), which would make (0,7) have only one bomb, but it's a '2'. That's a conflict. Therefore, (1,7) cannot be a bomb because it would make (0,7) incorrect. Therefore, the other bomb for (1,9) cannot be at (1,7). So, where else can it be? Let me see.\n\nThe '2' at (1,9) must have another bomb adjacent. The possible tiles are (1,7), (2,7), (2,9). But (2,9) is 2, which is a number, not a bomb. So, the only options are (1,7) and (2,7). But as we saw, (1,7) would cause a conflict with (0,7). Therefore, perhaps (2,7) is the bomb. But earlier, I thought that would cause a conflict with (2,8) being 1, because (2,8) is adjacent to (2,7) and (2,3). Let me recheck:\n\nIf (2,7) is a bomb, then (2,8) is adjacent to it. (2,8) is 1, which means it can only have one bomb adjacent. But (2,3) is a bomb, which is adjacent to (2,8). So, if (2,7) is also a bomb, then (2,8) would have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts the '1' at (2,8). Therefore, (2,7) cannot be a bomb either. So, this is a problem because the '2' at (1,9) requires another bomb, but neither (1,7) nor (2,7) can be bombs without causing a conflict elsewhere. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the current flag placements, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that (1,7) is a bomb. Let me re-examine. The '2' at (1,9) is adjacent to (0,9) which is a flag. So, that's one bomb. It needs another bomb. The other adjacent tiles are (1,7), (1,8), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). (1,8) is 1, which can't be a bomb. (2,8) is 1, same. (2,9) is 2, which is a number. So, the only possible tiles are (1,7) and (2,7). But as we saw, both cause conflicts. Therefore, this suggests that the current flags might be incorrect, or perhaps I need to look elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the '2' at (1,9) is correct, and I just need to find where the other bomb is without causing conflicts. Let me think differently. Perhaps the other bomb is not in (1,7) or (2,7), but elsewhere. Wait, no, the adjacent tiles to (1,9) are only those, so it must be one of them. Therefore, there must be an error in the current flag placements because the '2' at (1,9) can't be satisfied without conflicting with another number.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps one of the existing flags is incorrectly placed. For example, if (0,9) is not a bomb, then the '1' at (0,8) would be incorrect. But (0,8) is 1, and (0,9) is F, so that's correct. Alternatively, maybe (2,3) is not a bomb, but that's flagged, so it should be. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the '2' at (1,9) is correct, and I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the other bomb is at (2,7), and I have to accept that (2,8) would have two bombs, but that would make the '1' at (2,8) incorrect. Therefore, this suggests that there's a conflict, and perhaps one of the flags is wrong. But I can't remove a flag without making a move, and the game would end if I reveal a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the '2' at (1,9) is correct, and the other bomb is at (2,7), even though it causes a conflict with (2,8). But that can't be, because the '1' at (2,8) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Therefore, this suggests that the current state is impossible, which can't be the case. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's look for tiles where the numbers can help me determine where bombs are.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 7 is 2. Its adjacent tiles are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,8) is 1, (1,7) is _, (1,8) is 1. So, the '2' at (0,7) must have two bombs adjacent. One of them is (0,9) which is F, so the other must be either (1,7) or (1,6). But (1,6) is _, and (1,7) is _. So, perhaps (1,7) is a bomb, but as we saw earlier, that would cause a conflict with (0,7) being 2 and (1,9) being 2. Alternatively, (1,6) could be a bomb, but then (1,6) is adjacent to (1,5) which is 1, which would then have two bombs: (1,6) and (2,3). Wait, (1,5) is 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (1,6) is a bomb, then (1,5) would have (1,6) as a bomb, and perhaps another bomb elsewhere? Let me check.\n\n(1,5) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). (0,4) is _, (0,5) is _, (0,6) is _, (1,4) is 1, (1,6) is _, (2,4) is 1, (2,5) is _, (2,6) is _. So, if (1,6) is a bomb, then (1,5) is 1, which would require exactly one bomb adjacent. So, (1,6) being a bomb would satisfy that. But then, (0,7) is 2, which would have (0,9) and (1,6) as bombs, which would make it correct. So, that could work.\n\nSo, if (1,6) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (0,7) is 2, which would have two bombs: (0,9) and (1,6).\n- (1,5) is 1, which would have one bomb: (1,6).\n- (1,6) being a bomb would not affect (1,9) because (1,9) is adjacent to (1,6) only if (1,6) is a bomb, but (1,9) is 2, which needs two bombs. (0,9) is one, and perhaps (1,8) is another, but (1,8) is 1, which can't be a bomb. Alternatively, (2,7) would have to be a bomb, but that causes a conflict with (2,8).\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for other clues.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 3 is 2. Adjacent tiles: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,3) is F, so that's one bomb. So, the '2' at (3,3) needs another bomb adjacent. Let's see:\n\n- (2,2) is _, (2,4) is 1, (3,2) is _, (3,4) is _, (4,2) is _, (4,3) is 1, (4,4) is _.\n\nSo, the only possible bombs are (2,2), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4). But (2,2) is adjacent to (2,3) which is F, so (2,2) could be a bomb. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nIf (2,2) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (2,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). (2,0) is F, (2,2) is bomb, so (2,1) is 1, which would have two bombs adjacent, which is a conflict because (2,1) is 1, meaning only one bomb. Therefore, (2,2) cannot be a bomb.\n\nSo, the other bomb for (3,3) must be elsewhere. Let's check (4,3). (4,3) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (3,3) is 2, which is a number. If (4,3) is a bomb, then (3,3) would have two bombs: (2,3) and (4,3). That would satisfy the '2' at (3,3). But (4,3) is 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Therefore, that's not possible.\n\nWait, (4,3) is 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Therefore, the other bomb for (3,3) must be elsewhere. Let's check (3,2). If (3,2) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (3,2) being a bomb would affect (3,1) which is _, (3,3) which is 2, (4,1) which is 1, and (4,2) which is _.\n\n(4,1) is 1, which would have (3,2) as a bomb adjacent, so that's correct.\n\nSo, if (3,2) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (3,3) is 2, which has (2,3) and (3,2) as bombs \u2192 correct.\n- (4,1) is 1, which has (3,2) as a bomb \u2192 correct.\n\nThat seems to work. So, perhaps (3,2) is a bomb. Let me see if that causes any conflicts elsewhere.\n\nLooking at (3,2) being a bomb:\n\n- (2,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). (2,0) is F, (3,2) is bomb. So, (2,1) is 1, which would have two bombs adjacent, which is a conflict. Therefore, (3,2) cannot be a bomb because it would make (2,1) incorrect.\n\nSo, that's a problem. Therefore, the other bomb for (3,3) can't be at (3,2). So, where else? Maybe (4,4). If (4,4) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (3,3) is 2, which has (2,3) and (4,4) as bombs \u2192 correct.\n- (4,4) being a bomb would affect (4,3) which is 1, so (4,3) would have (4,4) as a bomb, which is correct.\n- (5,4) is _, which would have (4,4) as a bomb adjacent.\n\nBut does this cause any conflicts elsewhere? Let me check (5,4). (5,4) is _, so if (4,4) is a bomb, then (5,4) would be adjacent to a bomb, but (5,4) is unexplored. So, that's possible.\n\nBut wait, (4,4) is adjacent to (3,3) which is 2, so that's okay. Let me check if (4,4) being a bomb affects any other numbers.\n\nLooking at (4,5) which is _, (4,4) being a bomb would affect (4,5)'s count if it's a number, but (4,5) is _, so no issue.\n\nSo, perhaps (4,4) is a bomb. Let me tentatively accept that and see if it helps.\n\nNow, back to the '2' at (1,9). It needs another bomb adjacent. The possible tiles are (1,7) and (2,7). But as before, (1,7) being a bomb would cause (0,7) to have two bombs, which is correct because (0,7) is 2. Wait, (0,7) is 2, so if (1,7) is a bomb, then (0,7) would have (0,9) and (1,7) as bombs, which is correct. So, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nSo, if (1,7) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (0,7) is 2, which has (0,9) and (1,7) as bombs \u2192 correct.\n- (1,9) is 2, which has (0,9) and (1,7) as bombs \u2192 correct.\n- (1,8) is 1, which has (0,9) as a bomb \u2192 correct.\n- (2,7) is _, which is adjacent to (1,7) as a bomb, but (2,7) is not a number, so it's okay.\n- (2,8) is 1, which has (2,3) as a bomb \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, this seems to work without conflicts. Therefore, (1,7) must be a bomb.\n\nNow, let's see if this helps with other parts of the board. For example, (1,7) being a bomb would affect (1,6) which is _, but (1,6) is adjacent to (1,5) which is 1. So, (1,5) is 1, which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (1,7) is a bomb, that satisfies (1,5) being 1. So, correct.\n\nNow, looking back at (0,7) being 2, which is satisfied by (0,9) and (1,7).\n\nSo, with this, the '2' at (1,9) is satisfied, and the '2' at (0,7) is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's look for other clues. For example, (3,3) is 2, which we thought might have (4,4) as a bomb. Let's check if (4,4) being a bomb affects other numbers.\n\n(4,4) is adjacent to (3,3) which is 2, (4,3) which is 1, and (5,4) which is _. If (4,4) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (4,3) is 1, which would have (4,4) as a bomb \u2192 correct.\n- (5,4) would be adjacent to a bomb, but it's _, so no issue.\n- (3,4) is _, which is adjacent to (3,3) which is 2, so no problem.\n\nSo, (4,4) being a bomb seems acceptable.\n\nNow, let's check (5,5) which is 1. Adjacent tiles: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (6,6) is F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, (5,5) is 1, which is satisfied by (6,6). So, correct.\n\nLooking at (5,6) which is 1. Adjacent tiles: (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (6,6) is F, so that's one bomb. So, (5,6) is 1, which is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's look at (6,6) being F. It's adjacent to (5,5) which is 1, which is correct.\n\nLooking at (6,0) being F. It's adjacent to (5,0) which is _, and (7,0) which is _. So, no numbers around it to conflict.\n\nNow, looking at (6,9) being F. It's adjacent to (5,8) which is _, and (7,8) which is 1. (7,8) is 1, which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. (6,9) is F, so that's correct.\n\nNow, let's check (7,8) which is 1. Adjacent tiles: (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,7), (7,9), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). (6,9) is F, so that's one bomb. So, (7,8) is 1, which is correct.\n\nLooking at (8,1) which is 1. Adjacent tiles: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,1) is 1, (9,1) is 1. So, (8,1) is 1, which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. There are no flags nearby, so the bomb must be somewhere in the adjacent tiles. Perhaps (7,0) or (9,0), but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at (9,1) which is 1. Adjacent tiles: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,1) is 1, so the bomb must be somewhere else, perhaps (9,0) or (8,0).\n\nNow, let's try to find other clues. Looking at (3,0) which is 1. Adjacent tiles: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is F, so that's one bomb. So, (3,0) is 1, which is correct.\n\nLooking at (4,1) which is 1. Adjacent tiles: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0) is 1, (5,1) is 1. So, (4,1) is 1, which must have one bomb adjacent. There are no flags nearby except (2,0) which is not adjacent. So, the bomb must be somewhere around here, but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at (5,1) which is 1. Adjacent tiles: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (6,0) is F, so that's one bomb. So, (5,1) is 1, which is correct.\n\nLooking at (7,1) which is 1. Adjacent tiles: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0) is F, so that's one bomb. So, (7,1) is 1, which is correct.\n\nLooking at (8,1) which is 1. As before, the bomb must be in adjacent tiles.\n\nLooking at (9,1) which is 1. The bomb must be in adjacent tiles.\n\nNow, let's see how many bombs we've accounted for so far. The flags are at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (6,0), (6,6), (6,9). That's six flags. We've also identified potential bombs at (1,7), (4,4). So, that's 8 bombs accounted for. There are 10 bombs in total, so two more bombs are left.\n\nLet me check if I can find where the other bombs might be.\n\nLooking at (4,4) which I thought might be a bomb. Let's see if that works.\n\nIf (4,4) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (3,3) is 2, which has (2,3) and (4,4) as bombs \u2192 correct.\n- (4,3) is 1, which has (4,4) as a bomb \u2192 correct.\n- (5,4) is _, which is adjacent to (4,4) \u2192 no issue.\n\nSo, that works.\n\nNow, looking for the last bomb. Let's check (5,9) which is . If I can find a way to determine if it's a bomb or not.\n\nWait, (5,9) is adjacent to (6,9) which is F, so (5,9) can't be a bomb because it's adjacent to a flag, and the flag is a bomb. Wait, no, (5,9) is in row 5, column 9. (6,9) is row 6, column 9. So, they are adjacent vertically. Therefore, if (6,9) is F, then (5,9) can't be a bomb because it's adjacent to a flag, which is a bomb. So, (5,9) must be safe. So, perhaps revealing (5,9) would be safe, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (5,9), since it's adjacent to (6,9) which is F, it can't be a bomb. So, (5,9) is safe. So, perhaps I can reveal it.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if (5,9) is a bomb or not. Let me check adjacent numbers.\n\nLooking at (5,8) which is _, and (5,9) is adjacent to (6,9) which is F. So, (5,9) can't be a bomb because it's adjacent to a flag. Therefore, (5,9) is safe. So, revealing (5,9) would be safe, but I'm not sure if that's the best move.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a tile that is adjacent to a number which can help me determine if it's a bomb.\n\nLooking at (5,5) which is 1. It's adjacent to (6,6) which is F, so that's one bomb. So, (5,5) is satisfied.\n\nLooking at (5,6) which is 1. It's adjacent to (6,6) which is F, so that's correct.\n\nLooking at (5,7) which is 1. Adjacent tiles: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (6,6) is F, so that's one bomb. So, (5,7) is 1, which is correct.\n\nLooking at (5,8) which is _. It's adjacent to (5,7) which is 1, (5,9) which is ., (6,7) which is _, (6,8) which is _, (4,7) which is _, (4,8) which is 1. So, (5,8) is adjacent to (4,8) which is 1. So, (4,8) is 1, which must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent tiles to (4,8) are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (5,7) is 1, (5,8) is _, (5,9) is ., (4,9) is ., (3,9) is ., (3,8) is 1, (3,7) is _, (4,7) is _. So, (4,8) is 1, which must have one bomb adjacent. The only possible bomb is (5,7), but (5,7) is 1, which is a number, not a bomb. Alternatively, (3,8) is 1, which is a number. So, perhaps (4,8) is adjacent to a bomb that I haven't identified yet.\n\nWait, (4,8) is 1, so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The possible bombs could be (3,7), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). But (5,7) is 1, so it's not a bomb. (5,8) is _, (5,9) is ., (3,7) is _. So, perhaps (3,7) is a bomb. Let me check.\n\nIf (3,7) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (4,8) is 1, which would have (3,7) as a bomb \u2192 correct.\n- (3,7) is adjacent to (3,6) which is _, (3,8) which is 1, (4,6) which is _, (4,7) which is _, (2,6) which is _, (2,7) which is _, (2,8) which is 1.\n\nSo, (3,7) being a bomb would affect (3,8) which is 1. (3,8) is 1, which would have (3,7) as a bomb \u2192 correct.\n\nAlso, (2,7) is adjacent to (3,7), but (2,7) is _, so no conflict.\n\nSo, (3,7) being a bomb seems acceptable.\n\nNow, let's check how many bombs we've accounted for:\n\nFlags: (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (6,0), (6,6), (6,9) \u2192 6 bombs.\n\nIdentified bombs: (1,7), (4,4), (3,7) \u2192 3 more. Total: 9.\n\nThere's one more bomb to find.\n\nLooking for the last bomb. Let's see where it could be.\n\nLooking at (7,8) which is 1. It's adjacent to (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,7), (7,9), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). (6,9) is F, so that's one bomb. So, (7,8) is 1, which is correct.\n\nLooking at (8,8) which is _. It's adjacent to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). If (8,8) is a bomb, it would affect (7,8) which is 1, but (7,8) is already satisfied by (6,9). So, that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (9,8) which is _. It's adjacent to (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9). If (9,8) is a bomb, then (8,8) would be adjacent to it, but (8,8) is _, so no conflict.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (9,9) which is _. It's adjacent to (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). If (9,9) is a bomb, then (8,8) would be adjacent to it, but (8,8) is _, so no conflict.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (8,9) which is _. It's adjacent to (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9). If (8,9) is a bomb, then (7,8) is 1, which is already satisfied by (6,9). So, that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (9,7) which is _. It's adjacent to (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9,6), (9,8). If (9,7) is a bomb, then (8,7) is _, which is fine.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think of other areas.\n\nLooking at (5,3) which is 1. Adjacent tiles: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,4) is a bomb, so that satisfies (5,3) being 1.\n\nLooking at (5,4) which is _. It's adjacent to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,4) is a bomb, so (5,4) is adjacent to a bomb, which is fine.\n\nLooking at (6,7) which is _. It's adjacent to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). (6,6) is F, so (6,7) is adjacent to a bomb. So, (6,7) is safe? No, because (6,7) is adjacent to (6,6) which is F, so (6,7) is safe. Wait, no, (6,7) is adjacent to (6,6) which is F, but (6,7) itself could be a bomb or not. Wait, no, (6,7) is adjacent to a flag, which is a bomb, so (6,7) can't be a bomb. Therefore, (6,7) is safe. So, revealing (6,7) would be safe, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (7,7) which is _. It's adjacent to (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8). (6,6) is F, so (7,7) is adjacent to a bomb, making it safe. So, (7,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (7,6) which is _. It's adjacent to (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). (6,6) is F, so (7,6) is adjacent to a bomb, making it safe.\n\nBut I'm not making progress on finding the last bomb. Maybe I should consider revealing a tile that is adjacent to a number which can help me.\n\nLooking at (3,7) which I thought is a bomb. If I can confirm that, then the last bomb must be elsewhere.\n\nWait, I've already accounted for 9 bombs. Let me recount:\n\nFlags: 6 \u2192 (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (6,0), (6,6), (6,9).\n\nBombs identified: (1,7), (3,7), (4,4) \u2192 3.\n\nTotal: 9. So, one more bomb is left.\n\nLooking at (9,5) which is _. It's adjacent to (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6). If (9,5) is a bomb, it would affect (9,4) which is _, (9,6) which is _, etc. But I don't see any numbers around it to conflict.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (8,4) which is _. It's adjacent to (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). (7,4) is 1, which must have one bomb adjacent. If (8,4) is a bomb, then (7,4) is 1, which is satisfied. So, that's possible.\n\nSo, if (8,4) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (7,4) is 1, which is satisfied by (8,4) \u2192 correct.\n- (8,4) being a bomb would affect (8,3) which is _, (8,5) which is _, (9,4) which is _, (9,5) which is _.\n- (9,4) is _, which is adjacent to (8,4) \u2192 no conflict.\n- (7,3) is 2, which is adjacent to (8,4). (7,3) is 2, so it must have two bombs adjacent. The bombs would be (2,3) and (8,4). So, that works.\n\nSo, (8,4) being a bomb satisfies (7,3) being 2, as it would have (2,3) and (8,4) as bombs.\n\nTherefore, the last bomb is at (8,4).\n\nNow, let's confirm all bombs:\n\nFlags: (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (6,0), (6,6), (6,9) \u2192 6.\n\nBombs: (1,7), (3,7), (4,4), (8,4) \u2192 4.\n\nTotal: 10 bombs. Perfect.\n\nNow, with all bombs identified, I can look for the next move. Since I have 3 flags remaining, I can place flags on the identified bombs that are not yet flagged.\n\nLooking at the bombs:\n\n- (1,7) is a bomb, not flagged.\n- (3,7) is a bomb, not flagged.\n- (4,4) is a bomb, not flagged.\n- (8,4) is a bomb, not flagged.\n\nSo, I have four bombs that need to be flagged, but only three flags remaining. Therefore, I need to decide which ones to flag.\n\nBut wait, the flags I've placed are six, but the game info says flags remaining: 3. So, I can only place three more flags. Therefore, I can flag three of these four bombs.\n\nBut perhaps some of these bombs are already adjacent to numbers that require them to be flagged. For example, (1,7) is a bomb that is adjacent to (0,7) which is 2. Since (0,7) is 2 and already has (0,9) as a flag, it needs another bomb, which is (1,7). Therefore, (1,7) must be flagged to satisfy (0,7).\n\nSimilarly, (3,7) is adjacent to (4,8) which is 1, which needs exactly one bomb. So, (3,7) must be flagged.\n\n(4,4) is adjacent to (3,3) which is 2, which needs two bombs: (2,3) and (4,4). So, (4,4) must be flagged.\n\n(8,4) is adjacent to (7,3) which is 2, which needs two bombs: (2,3) and (8,4). So, (8,4) must be flagged.\n\nBut I can only place three flags, so I have to choose which ones to flag. However, all four are necessary to satisfy the numbers. This suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the bombs because I can't flag all of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misidentified some bombs. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking back, I thought (1,7) is a bomb because (0,7) is 2 and needs two bombs. (0,7) is adjacent to (0,9) and (1,7). So, (1,7) must be a bomb. Similarly, (3,7) is a bomb because (4,8) is 1 and needs (3,7) as a bomb. (4,4) is a bomb because (3,3) is 2 and needs (4,4). (8,4) is a bomb because (7,3) is 2 and needs (8,4). So, all four must be bombs, which is four more bombs, but I can only flag three. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps one of these is not a bomb, and I've made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of these bombs is already accounted for by a flag. Wait, no, the flags are at (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (6,0), (6,6), (6,9). So, none of the bombs I've identified are among the flags except (2,3) which is a flag.\n\nWait, (2,3) is a flag, which is a bomb, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the four bombs I've identified are (1,7), (3,7), (4,4), (8,4). None of these are flagged yet, so I can flag three of them, but that would leave one unflagged, which would mean that the numbers adjacent to it would be incorrect. Therefore, this suggests that my analysis is wrong somewhere.\n\nPerhaps I need to re-examine my earlier conclusions.\n\nLet me go back to (1,7). If (1,7) is a bomb, then (0,7) is 2, which is satisfied. (1,9) is 2, which is satisfied by (0,9) and (1,7). (4,8) is 1, which is satisfied by (3,7). (3,3) is 2, satisfied by (2,3) and (4,4). (7,3) is 2, satisfied by (2,3) and (8,4). (8,4) is a bomb, satisfying (7,3) and (7,4).\n\nSo, all numbers are satisfied with these bombs. Therefore, the four bombs must exist, but I can only flag three. This suggests that perhaps I should flag the ones that are required by the numbers, and the last one can be revealed later.\n\nBut since I have to make a move now, I should decide which tile to flag or reveal. Given that I have three flags left, I can flag three of these four bombs.\n\nLooking at the board, the bombs that are adjacent to numbers that require them to be flagged are:\n\n- (1,7): required by (0,7) and (1,9).\n- (3,7): required by (4,8).\n- (4,4): required by (3,3).\n- (8,4): required by (7,3).\n\nTherefore, all four are required by the numbers. So, I have to flag three of them. Perhaps I should flag the ones that are most critical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal a tile that is definitely safe to gain more information. For example, (5,9) is safe because it's adjacent to (6,9) which is F. So, revealing (5,9) would be safe and might help me identify more bombs.\n\nAlternatively, I could reveal (7,7) which is safe because it's adjacent to (6,6) which is F.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that would help me find the last bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should flag (1,7) because it's required by two numbers: (0,7) and (1,9). So, flagging (1,7) would satisfy both.\n\nThen, flag (3,7) because it's required by (4,8).\n\nThen, flag (4,4) because it's required by (3,3).\n\nThat would use up all three flags, leaving (8,4) as a bomb that's not flagged. But (7,3) is 2, which requires (2,3) and (8,4) as bombs. So, (8,4) must be a bomb, but I can't flag it. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps my earlier analysis is incorrect, and I've misidentified one of the bombs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (8,4) is not a bomb, and the last bomb is elsewhere. Let me think again.\n\nIf (8,4) is not a bomb, then (7,3) is 2, which needs two bombs adjacent. It's adjacent to (2,3) and needs another bomb. So, perhaps the other bomb is (7,4), which is 1. Wait, no, (7,4) is 1, which can't be a bomb. Alternatively, (8,3) is _, which could be a bomb. Let me check.\n\nIf (8,3) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (7,3) is 2, which would have (2,3) and (8,3) as bombs \u2192 correct.\n- (8,3) being a bomb would affect (8,2) which is _, (8,4) which is _, (9,2) which is _, (9,3) which is _, (7,2) which is _, (7,3) which is 2, (7,4) which is 1.\n\n(7,4) is 1, which would have (8,3) as a bomb \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, if (8,3) is a bomb, then:\n\n- (7,3) is 2, satisfied by (2,3) and (8,3) \u2192 correct.\n- (7,4) is 1, satisfied by (8,3) \u2192 correct.\n- (8,4) is _, which is no longer a bomb.\n\nSo, this would mean that the last bomb is at (8,3), not (8,4). Therefore, I can flag (8,3) instead of (8,4). Let me see if that works.\n\nSo, the bombs would be:\n\nFlags: (0,9), (2,0), (2,3), (6,0), (6,6), (6,9) \u2192 6.\n\nBombs: (1,7), (3,7), (4,4), (8,3) \u2192 4.\n\nTotal: 10 bombs.\n\nNow, checking the numbers:\n\n- (7,3) is 2, which has (2,3) and (8,3) \u2192 correct.\n- (7,4) is 1, which has (8,3) \u2192 correct.\n- (8,4) is _, which is fine.\n\nSo, this works without needing to flag (8,4). Therefore, the last bomb is at (8,3), not (8,4). So, I can flag (8,3) with one of my three flags.\n\nNow, the four bombs to flag are (1,7), (3,7), (4,4), (8,3). I can flag three of them. Let's choose the ones that are most critical.\n\nFlagging (1,7) is important because it affects two numbers: (0,7) and (1,9).\n\nFlagging (3,7) is important because it affects (4,8).\n\nFlagging (4,4) is important because it affects (3,3).\n\nFlagging (8,3) is important because it affects (7,3) and (7,4).\n\nSo, I have to choose three out of these four. Since all are important, perhaps I should flag the ones that are most time-sensitive, like (1,7) because it's affecting two numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can flag (1,7) first.\n\nSo, my move would be to flag (1,7).\n\nBut wait, the coordinate system is (x,y), where x is row, y is column. So, (1,7) is row 1, column 7.\n\nTherefore, the move would be x=1, y=7, flag=true.\n\nBut I need to make sure that placing a flag at (1,7) doesn't conflict with any numbers. Since (1,7) is a bomb, it's correct to flag it. Also, the numbers around it are satisfied as we've checked.\n\nSo, the next move would be to flag (1,7).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (1,7) because it's identified as a bomb necessary to satisfy the adjacent numbers (0,7) and (1,9). This move uses one of the remaining flags to correctly mark a bomb without conflicting with other revealed numbers.\n\nMOVE: 1,7,true", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . 2\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n3 1 2 F 2 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 F .\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 8, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the game info.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 2 flags remaining, so I can place two more flags if needed. My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without hitting a mine.\n\nLooking at the board, I see several revealed numbers and some flagged squares. I need to check if any of the existing flags conflict with the revealed numbers. Let me go through each number and see if the adjacent flags make sense.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 8 is a 1 and column 9 is a 2. Since it's the top row, the only adjacent squares are below it, so maybe I can look at the squares below 0,8 and 0,9 to see if the numbers there help.\n\nIn row 1, column 0 is a 1, and there's a flag at (2,0). So for (1,0) to be 1, it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The flag at (2,0) is one, so maybe that's correct.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 0 is an F, which is a flag. The square at (2,4) is a 1, so it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares around (2,4) are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). I'm not sure about that yet.\n\nRow 3, column 0 is a 1, and column 2 is an F. So (3,0) is 1, meaning it has one bomb adjacent. Since (2,0) is already flagged, that must be the one bomb. So that seems okay.\n\nRow 4, column 1 is a 1, and column 3 is a 1. So each of these should have one bomb adjacent. I'm not sure where those bombs are yet.\n\nRow 5, column 1 is a 1, column 3 is a 1, column 6 is a 1, and column 9 is an F. So (5,9) is flagged, which is a bomb. Let me check if the numbers around it make sense.\n\nLooking at (5,9), the adjacent squares would be (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9). Wait, (5,8) is a 2, so it should have two bombs adjacent. If (5,9) is a flag, then (5,8) must have another bomb somewhere else.\n\nWait, (5,8) is 2, so it needs two bombs. If (5,9) is a flag, that's one, so there must be another bomb adjacent to (5,8). The possible squares are (4,7), (4,8), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). But (6,9) is a flag, so that's another bomb. So (5,8) has two flags adjacent: (5,9) and (6,9). So that makes sense. So (5,8) is correctly 2 because it has two adjacent flags.\n\nNow, looking at row 6, column 0 is an F, column 6 is a 1, column 8 is an F, and column 9 is an F. So (6,0) is a flag, (6,8) is a flag, and (6,9) is a flag. Wait, but the game info says only 2 flags remaining, but I see three flags in row 6. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nRow 0: ... 1 2 F\nRow 1: ... F . 2\nRow 2: F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\nRow 3: 1 2 F 2 1 _ _ _ 1 .\nRow 4: _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\nRow 5: _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 F .\nRow 6: F _ _ _ _ 1 . F 1 F\nRow 7: _ 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _ _\nRow 8: _ 1 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\nRow 9: _ 1 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo in row 6, columns 0, 8, and 9 are F. That's three flags. But the game info says flags remaining is 2, so total flags placed so far would be 10 (total bombs) minus flags remaining (2) = 8 flags already placed. Wait, but I see more than 8 flags on the board. Let me count:\n\nRow 0: column 9 is F \u2192 1\nRow 1: column 7 is F \u2192 2\nRow 2: column 0 is F \u2192 3\nRow 3: column 2 is F \u21924\nRow 5: column 9 is F \u21925\nRow 6: columns 0,8,9 \u2192 3 more \u2192 total 8\nRow 7: no F\nRow 8: no F\nRow 9: no F\n\nSo total flags placed are 8, which matches the game info (flags remaining: 2). So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at the critical flag placement rules. Each number must have exactly the number of adjacent bombs as indicated.\n\nLet me check each number to see if the flags around them are correct.\n\nStarting with (0,8) which is 1. Its adjacent squares are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). (0,7) is _, (1,7) is _, (1,8) is F, (1,9) is 2. Wait, (1,9) is 2, so it's a number, not a flag. So (0,8) is 1, and the only flag adjacent is (1,8). So that's correct, as it should have one bomb adjacent.\n\n(0,9) is 2, adjacent squares: (0,8), (1,8), (1,9). (0,8) is 1, (1,8) is F, (1,9) is 2. So (0,9) is 2, and it has one flag adjacent (1,8). So there must be another bomb adjacent. The other adjacent squares are (0,8) which is 1, so maybe the bomb is elsewhere. Wait, (0,9) is 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. It already has one at (1,8). Where is the second? Maybe (1,9) is 2, so it's a number, not a bomb. So perhaps the second bomb is at (0,7) or (1,7). But those are unexplored. So maybe (0,9) is correct for now.\n\nLooking at (1,0) which is 1. Adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (2,0) is F, so that's one bomb. The rest are either _ or numbers. So that seems correct.\n\n(1,4) is 1. Adjacent squares: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (1,4) is 1, so it needs one bomb adjacent. Are any of these squares flagged? I don't see any flags in row 1 except (1,7). So maybe the bomb is somewhere else. Not sure yet.\n\n(1,9) is 2. Adjacent squares: (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9). (0,9) is 2, (1,8) is F, (2,8) is 1, (2,9) is 2. So (1,9) is 2, and it has one flag at (1,8). So it needs another bomb. Maybe (2,9) is a bomb, but (2,9) is 2, so it's a number, not a bomb. Hmm, maybe the bomb is at (0,8), but (0,8) is 1, so it's a number, not a bomb. So perhaps (1,9) is okay because it has one flag and another bomb somewhere else.\n\nMoving on, (2,4) is 1. Adjacent squares: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Are any of these flagged? (3,2) is F, but that's not adjacent to (2,4). So (2,4) needs one bomb adjacent. Maybe (3,3) or (3,5) is a bomb. Not sure yet.\n\n(3,0) is 1. Adjacent squares: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is F, so that's the one bomb. Correct.\n\n(3,2) is F. So that's a flag, which is a bomb.\n\n(3,7) is 1. Adjacent squares: (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). Any flags here? (2,8) is 1, (3,8) is _, (4,7) is 1. So (3,7) is 1, so it needs one bomb adjacent. Maybe (4,8) is a bomb, but it's 2. Wait, (4,8) is 2, so it's a number, not a bomb. Hmm.\n\n(4,1) is 1. Adjacent squares: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,2) is F, so that's one bomb. Correct.\n\n(4,3) is 1. Adjacent squares: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (3,2) is F, so that's one bomb. Correct.\n\n(4,7) is 1. Adjacent squares: (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (5,8) is 2, (5,9) is F. So (4,7) is 1, needs one bomb. Maybe (5,8) is a bomb, but (5,8) is 2, so it's a number. Hmm, maybe (5,9) is a bomb, which is flagged. So (4,7) is 1, and (5,9) is a flag, so that's the one bomb. So that works.\n\n(4,8) is 2. Adjacent squares: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (5,9) is F, (5,8) is 2. So (4,8) is 2, needs two bombs. It has one flag at (5,9). Where's the other? Maybe (3,9) is a bomb, but (3,9) is _, unexplored. Or (5,8) is 2, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. So perhaps (3,7) is a bomb, but (3,7) is 1, so it's a number. So maybe (4,8) is okay because it has one flag and another bomb somewhere else.\n\n(5,1) is 1. Adjacent squares: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (6,0) is F, so that's one bomb. Correct.\n\n(5,3) is 1. Adjacent squares: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,3) is 1, (5,2) is 1, (5,4) is _, (6,2) is _, etc. Not sure about bombs here.\n\n(5,6) is 1. Adjacent squares: (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (6,6) is 1. So (5,6) is 1, needs one bomb. Maybe (6,5) is a bomb, but it's _, or (6,7) is _, or (4,5) is _.\n\n(5,8) is 2. Adjacent squares: (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). (5,9) is F, (6,8) is F, (6,9) is F. So (5,8) is 2, and it has three flags adjacent. That's a problem because it should only have two bombs. Wait, that can't be right. So (5,8) is 2, but it's adjacent to three flags: (5,9), (6,8), (6,9). That's three bombs, but (5,8) is 2, which means it should have exactly two bombs. So that's a conflict.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So (5,8) is 2, but it's adjacent to three flags. That's a conflict because it can't have three bombs. So maybe one of those flags is incorrect. So perhaps one of the flags at (5,9), (6,8), or (6,9) is wrong.\n\nLooking at (6,8) and (6,9), both are F. (6,8) is adjacent to (5,8) which is 2. So if (5,8) is 2, it can only have two bombs. But it's adjacent to three flags, which would imply three bombs, which is impossible. So one of those flags must be incorrectly placed.\n\nSo which one is wrong? Let's check each flag:\n\n- (5,9) is F. Let's see what other numbers are around it. (5,8) is 2, which we just discussed. (5,9) is also adjacent to (4,8), which is 2, and (4,9) is _, (6,8) is F, (6,9) is F. So (5,9) is a flag, which is a bomb. But (5,8) is 2, which can only have two bombs adjacent. If (5,9) is a bomb, then (5,8) must have another bomb, which would be either (6,8) or (6,9). But both are flags, which would make it three bombs, which is impossible.\n\nSo this suggests that either (5,9), (6,8), or (6,9) is incorrectly flagged. Since (5,8) is 2, it can only have two bombs adjacent. So one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\nLooking at (6,6) which is 1. Adjacent squares: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,6) is 1, (6,5) is _, (6,7) is _, (7,5) is 1, (7,6) is 1, (7,7) is 1. So (6,6) is 1, needs one bomb. Maybe (5,5) is a bomb, but it's _, or (5,7) is a bomb, but it's _, or (7,5) is 1, which is a number.\n\nWait, maybe (6,6) is 1, so it needs one bomb. If (6,8) is a flag, which is a bomb, then (6,6) is two squares away, so not adjacent. So that doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (6,0) which is F. Let's see what numbers are around it. (5,0) is _, (5,1) is 1, (6,1) is _, (7,0) is _, (7,1) is 1. So (6,0) is a flag, which is a bomb. The number (5,1) is 1, which is adjacent to (6,0). So (5,1) is 1, which should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (6,0) is a flag, that's the one bomb. So that's correct.\n\nSo back to (5,8) being 2 with three flags adjacent. That's a problem. So one of the flags must be wrong. Let's consider each possibility:\n\n1. If (5,9) is not a bomb, then (5,8) would have two flags: (6,8) and (6,9). That would make (5,8) have two bombs, which is correct. But then (5,9) would be a safe square, which is currently flagged. So that's a possibility. But (5,9) is currently flagged, so if it's not a bomb, then that's an incorrect flag, and we should remove it.\n\n2. If (6,8) is not a bomb, then (5,8) would have two flags: (5,9) and (6,9). That would be correct. So (6,8) would be a safe square, but it's currently flagged. So that's another possibility.\n\n3. Similarly, if (6,9) is not a bomb, then (5,8) would have two flags: (5,9) and (6,8). That would be correct. So (6,9) would be a safe square, but it's currently flagged.\n\nSo which one is more likely? Let's look at other numbers around these flags.\n\nLooking at (6,8) which is F. The adjacent squares are (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). (5,8) is 2, (5,9) is F, (6,9) is F, (7,8) is _, (7,9) is _. So (6,8) is a flag, which is a bomb. The number (5,8) is 2, which needs two bombs adjacent. If (6,8) is a bomb, then (5,8) has two bombs: (5,9) and (6,8), but (6,9) is also a flag, which would make it three. So that's the problem.\n\nAlternatively, if (6,8) is not a bomb, then (5,8) would have two bombs: (5,9) and (6,9). Let's check if that's possible.\n\nLooking at (6,9) which is F. Adjacent squares: (5,8), (5,9), (6,8), (7,8), (7,9). (5,9) is F, (6,8) is F, (7,8) is _, (7,9) is _. So (6,9) is a flag, which is a bomb. The number (5,8) is 2, which would have two bombs: (5,9) and (6,9). That would make (5,8) correct. But then (6,8) is also a flag, which would be a third bomb adjacent to (5,8), which is impossible because (5,8) is 2.\n\nSo the problem is that (5,8) is adjacent to three flags: (5,9), (6,8), and (6,9). That's three bombs, but (5,8) is 2, which can only have two. So one of these must be incorrect.\n\nLooking at other numbers around (5,9). (5,9) is adjacent to (4,8), which is 2. (4,8) is 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (5,9) is F, (5,8) is 2, (4,9) is _, (3,9) is _. So (4,8) is 2, needs two bombs. It has one flag at (5,9). So it needs another bomb. Maybe (3,9) is a bomb, but it's unexplored. Or (4,7) is 1, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. So (4,8) needs another bomb, possibly at (3,9) or (5,7). But (5,7) is _, so maybe.\n\nIf I assume that (5,9) is correctly flagged, then (4,8) needs another bomb, which could be at (3,9). But (3,9) is unexplored. Alternatively, if (5,9) is not a bomb, then (4,8) would need two bombs elsewhere, but that might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, if (6,9) is not a bomb, then (5,8) would have two flags: (5,9) and (6,8). Let's see what that would mean for (6,9). If (6,9) is not a bomb, then it's a safe square, but it's currently flagged. So that's a problem because we can't have a flag on a safe square.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for other clues.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 0 is _, column 1 is 1, column 2 is 2, column 3 is 2, column 4 is 1, column 5 is 1, column 6 is 1, column 7 is 1, column 8 is _, column 9 is _.\n\n(7,1) is 1. Adjacent squares: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0) is F, so that's one bomb. Correct.\n\n(7,2) is 2. Adjacent squares: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (6,0) is F, but that's not adjacent to (7,2). So (7,2) is 2, needs two bombs. Are there any flags nearby? (6,3) is _, (7,3) is 2. Not sure.\n\n(7,3) is 2. Adjacent squares: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (6,0) is F, but not adjacent. So needs two bombs. Not sure.\n\n(7,4) is 1. Adjacent squares: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). (6,5) is _, (7,3) is 2, (7,5) is 1. So needs one bomb. Maybe (6,3) or (6,5).\n\n(7,5) is 1. Adjacent squares: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (6,6) is 1, (7,4) is 1. So needs one bomb. Maybe (6,5) or (6,4).\n\n(7,6) is 1. Adjacent squares: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). (6,6) is 1, (6,7) is _, (7,5) is 1, (7,7) is 1. So needs one bomb. Maybe (6,5) or (6,7).\n\n(7,7) is 1. Adjacent squares: (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8). (6,6) is 1, (6,8) is F. So (7,7) is 1, needs one bomb. (6,8) is a flag, which is a bomb, so that's the one. Correct.\n\nSo (7,7) is 1, adjacent to (6,8) which is a flag. So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking back at the problem with (5,8), which is 2 but adjacent to three flags. I think the most likely issue is that one of the flags is incorrect. Since (5,8) is 2, it can only have two bombs adjacent. So one of (5,9), (6,8), or (6,9) is incorrectly flagged.\n\nLooking at (6,8) and (6,9), both are in row 6, which has three flags: (6,0), (6,8), (6,9). Since we only have two flags remaining, but all three are already placed, so they must be correct unless one is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,9) is not a bomb. Let me check what other numbers are around (5,9). (5,9) is adjacent to (4,8) which is 2, (4,9) which is _, (5,8) which is 2, and (6,8) and (6,9). If (5,9) is not a bomb, then (4,8) must have two bombs. (4,8) is 2, so it needs two bombs. It's adjacent to (5,9) which would not be a bomb, so it needs two bombs elsewhere. The adjacent squares are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (5,8) is 2, which is a number, not a bomb. (4,7) is 1, which is a number. (3,7) is 1, which is a number. So (4,8) would need two bombs, but the only possible is (3,9) and maybe (5,7). But (5,7) is _, so maybe.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider other moves. Perhaps revealing a square that can give me more information.\n\nLooking at (9,1), which is 1. Its adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,1) is 1, (9,1) is 1. So (9,1) is 1, needs one bomb. Maybe (8,0) is a bomb, but it's _, or (8,2) is a bomb, but it's _.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (8,1) which is 1. Adjacent squares: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,1) is 1, (9,1) is 1. So (8,1) is 1, needs one bomb. Maybe (7,0) is a bomb, but it's _, or (9,0) is a bomb, which is _.\n\nNot sure. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, so revealing it could help multiple numbers.\n\nLooking at (5,5), which is _. It's adjacent to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (4,4) is _, (4,5) is _, (5,4) is _, (5,6) is 1, (6,4) is _, (6,5) is _, (6,6) is 1. So revealing (5,5) might help clarify if it's a bomb or not, which could affect multiple numbers.\n\nAlternatively, (5,7) is _, adjacent to (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (5,8) is 2, (4,8) is 2, (6,8) is F. So revealing (5,7) could help determine if it's a bomb, which would affect (5,8) and (4,8).\n\nBut if I reveal a square and it's a bomb, the game ends. So I have to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere else, but I only have two flags left. Let me see where I can place a flag that doesn't conflict with any numbers.\n\nLooking at (3,9), which is _. It's adjacent to (2,8), (2,9), (3,8), (4,8), (4,9). (2,8) is 1, (4,8) is 2, (3,8) is _, (4,9) is _. So if I flag (3,9), would that conflict with any numbers? (2,9) is 2, which is adjacent to (3,9). So (2,9) is 2, which would then have one flag at (3,9). It needs two bombs, so that's okay. (4,8) is 2, which would have one flag at (5,9) and possibly another at (3,9). That would make (4,8) have two bombs, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, (4,8) is 2, and if (3,9) is a bomb, then (4,8) would have two bombs: (3,9) and (5,9). That would make (4,8) correct. So flagging (3,9) might be possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure if (3,9) is a bomb. Alternatively, maybe (3,9) is safe, and I shouldn't flag it.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (5,7), which is _. If I reveal it, and it's a bomb, game over. If it's safe, then I can mark it as such. But it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (6,5), which is _. It's adjacent to (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,6) is 1, (6,6) is 1, (7,4) is 1, (7,5) is 1, (7,6) is 1. So if (6,5) is a bomb, then all these numbers would have one bomb adjacent. But if it's not, then they need bombs elsewhere.\n\nBut again, revealing it could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1, which would make it safer. For example, (7,7) is 1, so its adjacent squares must have exactly one bomb. Since (7,7) is 1, and it's adjacent to (6,8) which is a flag, that's the one bomb. So all other adjacent squares must be safe. So (5,6) is 1, which is adjacent to (7,7). Wait, no, (7,7) is adjacent to (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), etc.\n\nWait, (7,7) is 1, so it has one bomb adjacent, which is (6,8). So the other adjacent squares must be safe. So (5,6) is 1, which is two squares away from (7,7), so that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (5,5), which is adjacent to (5,6) which is 1. If (5,5) is a bomb, then (5,6) would have one bomb, which is correct. But I don't know.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to find a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at (5,6) which is 1. Its adjacent squares are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). It needs exactly one bomb. If I can find which one, that would help.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (5,3) which is 1. Adjacent squares: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). It needs one bomb. Maybe (4,2) is a bomb, which is 2, so it's a number, not a bomb. Or (6,4) is a bomb, but it's _.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,3) is 1, and the bomb is at (4,4), which is _.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should try to find a square that is most likely to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem with (5,8) being 2 and adjacent to three flags. I think the most likely incorrect flag is (6,8) because if I remove that flag, then (5,8) would have two flags: (5,9) and (6,9), which would make it correct. Also, (6,8) is adjacent to (5,8) which is 2, and (6,8) is a flag. If (6,8) is not a bomb, then (5,8) would have two flags, which is correct. Also, (6,8) is adjacent to (7,8) which is _, and (6,7) which is _. So maybe (6,8) is not a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (6,8) is a bomb, and (5,8) is incorrect. But (5,8) is 2, so it can't have three bombs.\n\nWait, perhaps (6,8) is not a bomb, so I should remove the flag there. That would free up a flag, allowing me to place it elsewhere if needed. But the problem is that I can only remove a flag if I make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\n\nSo, perhaps my next move should be to remove the flag at (6,8). Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (6,8), then (5,8) would have two flags: (5,9) and (6,9), which would make (5,8) correct. Also, (6,8) would then be a safe square, which is possible.\n\nSo, the move would be to remove the flag at (6,8). That would mean making a move with flag=true on (6,8), which would remove the flag.\n\nBut wait, according to the rules, to remove a flag, I have to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So, MOVE: 6,8,true would remove the flag.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, maybe I should flag a different square that doesn't cause conflicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal a square that can help clarify the situation. For example, revealing (3,9) would tell me if it's a bomb or not, which would help with (4,8) and (5,8).\n\nBut revealing (3,9) could be risky if it's a bomb. Alternatively, revealing (5,7) could help determine if it's a bomb, affecting (5,8) and (4,8).\n\nBut given the conflict at (5,8), I think the safest move is to remove the flag at (6,8) to resolve the conflict.\n\nSo, the move would be to remove the flag at (6,8), which is at coordinates (6,8), and set flag=true to remove it.\n\nWait, no, the format is MOVE: x,y,flag. So to remove a flag, I have to set flag=true on an already flagged square. So the move would be 6,8,true.\n\nBut wait, in the board, (6,8) is F, so it's already flagged. So making a move with flag=true there would remove the flag.\n\nSo, the explanation would be that removing the flag at (6,8) resolves the conflict where (5,8) is 2 but has three adjacent flags. By removing (6,8), (5,8) now has two flags: (5,9) and (6,9), which is correct.\n\nSo, the move is to remove the flag at (6,8).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Removing the flag at (6,8) resolves the conflict where (5,8) is 2 but has three adjacent flags. This ensures (5,8) correctly has two adjacent bombs.\nMOVE: 6,8,true", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n3 1 2 F 2 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 F .\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 9, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current board state and the game info. The board is 10x10, which is pretty big, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have one flag remaining because the flags remaining are 1. So, I need to be careful where I place that last flag.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the board and look for any obvious conflicts or areas where I can deduce where a bomb must be or where it can't be. Let's start from the top and work my way down.\n\nLooking at row 0, I see that at (0,8) there's a 1 and at (0,9) there's a 2. These numbers indicate adjacent bombs. Since (0,8) is a 1, it means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares. The same goes for (0,9) with a 2. Now, looking at the squares around (0,8), which is position (0,8), the adjacent squares would be (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). Wait, but (0,9) is already a 2, so maybe the bomb is somewhere else.\n\nWait, no, (0,8) is a 1, so it's indicating that one of its adjacent squares is a bomb. But looking at the board, (0,7) is a 1, which might have its own adjacent bombs. Hmm, maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 1, I see that (1,0) is a 1, (1,1) is a 1, (1,2) is a 2, and so on. At (1,9), there's a 2. Also, (1,8) is an F, which is a flag. So, the flag at (1,8) is one of the two bombs that the 2 at (0,9) is indicating, because (0,9) is adjacent to (1,8) and (1,9). Since (0,9) is a 2, and there's a flag at (1,8), that means there must be another bomb adjacent to (0,9). So, perhaps the other bomb is at (1,9), but (1,9) is a 2, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Therefore, maybe the other bomb is at (0,7) or (1,7). Wait, but (0,7) is a 1, so it's indicating one bomb around it. If (0,7) is a 1, then it must have exactly one bomb adjacent to it. Let me check the surrounding squares of (0,7). The adjacent squares would be (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), and (1,8). (1,8) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So, (0,7) is a 1, and it's accounted for by the flag at (1,8). So that makes sense.\n\nNow, looking at row 2, I see (2,0) is an F, so that's another flag. Then at (2,4) there's a 1, and at (2,7) a 1, (2,8) and (2,9) are 2s. So, let's see, the 1 at (2,4) means there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares would be (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Hmm, not sure about that yet.\n\nLooking at row 3, (3,0) is a 1, (3,1) is a 2, (3,3) is an F, so that's another flag. Then (3,4) is a 1, and so on. The 2 at (3,1) means two bombs are adjacent to it. The adjacent squares would be (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So, there must be another bomb adjacent to (3,1). Looking around, perhaps (4,0) or (4,1) could be bombs.\n\nIn row 4, (4,1) is a 1, which indicates one bomb nearby. Its adjacent squares include (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0) is a 1, so maybe that's where the bomb is, but (3,0) is a number, not a bomb. Wait, no, (3,0) is a 1, so it's indicating one bomb adjacent to it. So, perhaps (4,0) is a bomb because (3,0) is a 1, and (4,0) is adjacent. If (4,0) is a bomb, then that would satisfy (3,0)'s count. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 5, (5,0) is a 1, (5,1) is a 1, (5,3) is a 1, and so on. The 1 at (5,0) indicates one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares would be (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1). If (4,0) is a bomb, then that would satisfy (5,0)'s count.\n\nRow 6 has (6,0) as an F, another flag, and (6,9) as an F. So, two flags there. Also, (6,5) is a 1, so that's indicating one bomb nearby.\n\nRow 7 has (7,0) as a 1, (7,1) as a 2, and so on. The 2 at (7,1) means two bombs are adjacent. Its adjacent squares would include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So, there must be another bomb adjacent to (7,1). Maybe (6,1) or (8,1) could be bombs.\n\nRow 8 has (8,1) as a 1, so that's indicating one bomb nearby. Its adjacent squares would be (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). If (8,1) is a 1, then there's exactly one bomb around it. Maybe (7,0) is a bomb, but (7,0) is a 1, so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps (9,1) is a bomb because (8,1) is a 1.\n\nRow 9 has (9,1) as a 1, so that's indicating one bomb nearby. Its adjacent squares would be (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). If (9,1) is a 1, then there's one bomb adjacent. Maybe (8,0) is a bomb, but (8,0) is a dot, so it's unexplored. Alternatively, perhaps (9,0) is a bomb, but (9,0) is a dot as well.\n\nNow, considering that there are 10 bombs in total and I've already placed 3 flags: at (0,8) is a 1, (1,8) is an F, (2,0) is an F, (3,3) is an F, (6,0) is an F, (6,9) is an F, and (9,9) is an F. Wait, no, looking back, the flags are at (0,8) is a 1, so that's a number, not a flag. Wait, no, looking at the board again:\n\nRow 0: ... 1 2 F at (0,8), (0,9), (0,10?) Wait, the board is 10x10, so columns go from 0 to 9. So, in row 0, columns 8 and 9 are 1 and 2, and F? Wait, the board state shows:\n\nRow 0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n\nWait, that can't be right because the columns are 0-9, so row 0 has 10 elements. So, position (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2, and (0,10) would be beyond, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the board is written as row 0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F, meaning that (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2, and (0,10) is F, but that's outside the 10x10 grid. So maybe it's a typo, and the F is at (0,9). But in the problem statement, it's written as:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\n... etc.\n\nWait, that can't be right because each row should have 10 columns, from 0 to 9. So, row 0 has 10 elements: positions (0,0) to (0,9). So, the last element is (0,9) which is F. So, in row 0, (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is F. Similarly, row 1 has at (1,8) an F and (1,9) is a 2. So, the flags are at (0,9), (1,8), (2,0), (3,3), (6,0), (6,9), and (9,9). Wait, that's 7 flags, but the game info says flags remaining is 1, so total flags placed so far would be 10 - 1 = 9? Wait, no, the game info says flags remaining is 1, so I have placed 9 flags so far, but that can't be because there are only 10 bombs. Wait, no, the game info says flags remaining is 1, meaning I can place one more flag. So, I have placed 9 flags already, but looking at the board, I count:\n\n- (0,9): F\n- (1,8): F\n- (2,0): F\n- (3,3): F\n- (6,0): F\n- (6,9): F\n- (9,9): F\n\nWait, that's 7 flags. So, I have 3 flags remaining? But the game info says flags remaining is 1. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: F at (0,9)\nRow 1: F at (1,8)\nRow 2: F at (2,0)\nRow 3: F at (3,3)\nRow 6: F at (6,0) and (6,9)\nRow 9: F at (9,9)\n\nSo that's 7 flags. So, flags remaining is 1, meaning I have placed 9 flags, but I only see 7. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the board was miswritten, but I'll proceed with the info given.\n\nNow, I need to find where to place the next flag or reveal a tile. Since I have one flag left, I should look for a spot where a bomb must be, based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,9) is an F, so that's a flag. (0,8) is a 1, indicating one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (0,8) are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). (0,9) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So, (0,8)'s count is satisfied. So, no conflict there.\n\nLooking at (1,9), which is a 2. Its adjacent squares include (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9). (0,9) is a flag, (1,8) is a flag, so that's two bombs, which matches the 2. So, that's correct.\n\nLooking at (2,9), which is a 2. Its adjacent squares include (1,8), (1,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9). (1,8) is a flag, (1,9) is a 2, so that's one bomb. So, there must be another bomb adjacent to (2,9). The possible squares are (2,8), (3,8), or (3,9). (2,8) is a 1, so that's a number, not a bomb. (3,8) is a 1, also a number. (3,9) is a dot. So, perhaps (3,9) is a bomb.\n\nWait, but (3,9) is a dot, so if I place a flag there, that would be my next move. But I need to check if that's consistent with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (3,8), which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). (2,9) is a 2, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (3,9) is a dot, so if I place a flag there, that would make (3,8)'s count satisfied because (3,9) would be a bomb. Also, (2,9) is a 2, so it would have two bombs: (1,8) and (3,9), which fits.\n\nSo, placing a flag at (3,9) seems like a good move. Let me check other areas to see if this makes sense.\n\nLooking at (4,9), which is a dot. If (3,9) is a bomb, then (4,9)'s adjacent squares would include (3,8), (3,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9). (3,9) is a bomb, so (4,9) would have at least one bomb adjacent. But (4,9) is a dot, so it's unexplored. I don't have info on it yet.\n\nAnother area to check is row 6, which has (6,0) and (6,9) as flags. (6,5) is a 1, so it needs one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). If (5,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy (6,5)'s count, but I don't know yet.\n\nLooking at row 7, (7,1) is a 2, which needs two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So, there must be another bomb adjacent. Maybe (6,1) or (8,1) is a bomb.\n\nIf I consider placing a flag at (3,9), that would satisfy the counts for (2,9) and (3,8). Let me see if that causes any conflicts elsewhere. For example, (4,9) would then have a bomb at (3,9), so if (4,9) is a number, it should reflect that. But (4,9) is a dot, so it's unexplored, so no conflict yet.\n\nAnother consideration: how many bombs are left? There are 10 bombs in total. I've placed 7 flags, so there are 3 bombs left. If I place a flag at (3,9), that would be the 8th flag, leaving 2 more bombs. But wait, the game info says flags remaining is 1, so I can only place one more flag. So, I have to choose where to place it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a tile instead of placing a flag. Let me see if there's a safe tile to reveal. For example, (5,5) is a 1, so if I reveal it, I can see if it's a bomb or not, but that's risky. Alternatively, maybe (3,9) is a bomb, so placing a flag there would be safe.\n\nWait, but if I place a flag at (3,9), I have to make sure that it doesn't conflict with any numbers. Let me check (3,8) again. (3,8) is a 1, and if (3,9) is a bomb, that satisfies its count. Also, (2,9) is a 2, which would have two bombs: (1,8) and (3,9). So that works.\n\nAnother area: (7,1) is a 2, needing two bombs. It has (6,0) as a flag, so one bomb. It needs another bomb. If I can find where that bomb is, maybe I can place a flag there. Let's look at (7,1)'s adjacent squares: (6,0) is a flag, (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). If (8,1) is a 1, then it needs one bomb adjacent. So, if (7,1) needs another bomb, maybe (8,1) is a bomb, but (8,1) is a 1, which would mean it has one bomb adjacent. If (8,1) is a bomb, then (7,1) would have two bombs: (6,0) and (8,1), which would satisfy its count. But (8,1) is a 1, so it can't be a bomb because it's a number. Wait, no, (8,1) is a 1, meaning it's a number, not a bomb. So, the bomb must be elsewhere. Maybe (7,2) is a bomb. If (7,2) is a bomb, then (7,1)'s count is satisfied, and (7,2) would be a bomb. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nLooking at (7,2), it's a dot. If it's a bomb, then (7,1)'s count is satisfied. Also, (6,2) is adjacent to (7,2), so if (6,2) is a number, it would have to account for that bomb. But (6,2) is a dot, so I don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (6,1) is a bomb. If (6,1) is a bomb, then (7,1)'s count is satisfied. Also, (6,1) is adjacent to (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2). (6,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb. If (6,1) is a bomb, that would be another bomb adjacent to (6,0), but (6,0) is a flag, so that's okay. Wait, no, (6,0) is a flag, so it's a bomb, but (6,1) is adjacent to it. So, if (6,1) is a bomb, then (6,0) would have a bomb adjacent, which is fine because (6,0) is a flag.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me go back to the earlier idea of placing a flag at (3,9). That seems like a solid move because it satisfies two numbers: (2,9) and (3,8). Also, since I have only one flag left, it's better to use it where it's most certain.\n\nSo, I think the next move should be to place a flag at (3,9). That would use my last flag, and it fits the counts for the surrounding numbers. I don't see any immediate conflicts with that move, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (3,9) satisfies the adjacent counts for (2,9) and (3,8) without conflicting with other revealed numbers.\n\nMOVE: 3,9,true", "flags_remaining": 1, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n3 1 2 F 2 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 F .\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the rules.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The flags remaining are 0, which means I can't place any new flags unless I remove an existing one. But I have to be careful because if I reveal a bomb, the game ends. So, I need to focus on either revealing a safe square or possibly removing a flag if it's incorrectly placed.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares are already revealed with numbers, some are flagged (F), and others are still unexplored (.). My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs.\n\nLet me go through the board step by step. Starting from the top:\n\nRow 0 has some numbers and a flagged square at (0,8) and (0,9). Wait, but the flags remaining are 0, so I can't add any new flags. Maybe I should check if any existing flags are incorrect.\n\nLooking at row 1, there's a 1 at (1,0), which means there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0). But (1,0) is a 1, so if any of its adjacent squares are flagged, that might be a problem. Wait, (1,0) is 1, and there's a flag at (0,8) and (0,9), but those are far away. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 2, there's an F at (2,0), which is a flag. The square at (2,0) is flagged, so I need to check if that's correct. Let me see the adjacent squares to (2,0). The adjacent squares would be (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), and (3,0). (1,0) is a 1, which means there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. If (2,0) is a flag (bomb), then (1,0) would have one bomb adjacent, which is correct. But I need to make sure that (2,0) is indeed a bomb and not a misflag.\n\nWait, but I can't place any new flags, so maybe I should check if any existing flags are incorrect. If a flag is incorrectly placed, it's a problem because it's taking up a spot that could be a safe square, and I can't add any more flags.\n\nLooking at row 3, there's an F at (3,2). Let me check the adjacent squares to (3,2). The adjacent squares are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Now, (3,2) is flagged as a bomb, so I need to see if any of the adjacent squares have numbers that conflict with this.\n\nFor example, (3,0) is a 1. The adjacent squares to (3,0) are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), and (4,1). Since (2,0) is flagged, that would satisfy the 1 at (3,0), meaning no other bombs are adjacent to (3,0). So that seems okay.\n\nLooking at row 4, there's an F at (4,9). Let's check the adjacent squares to (4,9). They are (3,8), (3,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9). (4,9) is a flag, so if any of the adjacent squares have numbers, they should account for this flag.\n\nLooking at (4,7) which is a 2. The adjacent squares to (4,7) are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). If (4,9) is a bomb, then (4,7) being a 2 would need exactly two bombs adjacent. But I'm not sure if that's conflicting yet.\n\nWait, maybe I should check row 6 where there are multiple F's. At (6,0), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9) are all flagged. Let's check the adjacent squares to these.\n\nStarting with (6,0): adjacent squares are (5,0), (5,1), (6,1). (5,0) is a _, so it's revealed but empty. (5,1) is a 1. So if (6,0) is a flag, then (5,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. But (5,1) is a 1, and if (6,0) is a bomb, that counts as one. So that's okay.\n\nNow, (6,7) is a flag. Let's check adjacent squares. (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). (5,7) is a 1, so if (6,7) is a bomb, then (5,7) would have one bomb adjacent, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, (6,8) is a flag. Adjacent squares include (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). (5,8) is a 2, so if (6,8) is a bomb, that counts towards the 2. But I'm not sure if that's conflicting yet.\n\n(6,9) is a flag. Adjacent squares are (5,8), (5,9), (6,8), (7,8), (7,9). (5,9) is a ., so unexplored. (5,8) is a 2. If (6,9) is a bomb, that counts towards (5,8)'s count. But I don't know yet.\n\nI think I need to find a square where the numbers indicate that a flag must or must not be there. Maybe I can find a number that is already conflicting with the existing flags.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is a 1. So (0,8) is a 1, which means exactly one bomb is adjacent. The adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). (0,9) is an F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, (0,8) is satisfied because it's a 1. So that seems okay.\n\nWait, but (0,8) is a 1, and (0,9) is a flag. So that's correct. So no conflict there.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0 is a 1. The adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0). (2,0) is a flag, so that satisfies the 1. So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at row 3, column 2 is a flag. Let's see if that causes any conflicts. The square (3,2) is a flag, so any adjacent squares with numbers should account for this.\n\nLooking at (3,1), which is a 2. The adjacent squares to (3,1) are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) is a flag, and (3,2) is a flag. So that's two flags adjacent to (3,1). But (3,1) is a 2, which means exactly two bombs adjacent. So that's correct.\n\nSo far, I don't see any obvious conflicts. But I have to remember that I can't place any new flags, so maybe I should look for a square that's safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 1 is a 1. Let's check what's around it. (5,1) is 1, so adjacent squares are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (6,0) is a flag, which would satisfy the 1. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but (5,1) is a 1, and (6,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So (5,1) is correctly accounted for.\n\nNow, looking at row 7, column 1 is a 1. Adjacent squares are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb, satisfying the 1. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, I'm not finding any obvious conflicts. Maybe I should look for a square that's definitely safe to reveal. Let's see.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4 is a 1. The adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Wait, (2,4) is a 1, so it has exactly one bomb adjacent. Let me see if any of the adjacent squares are flagged or have numbers.\n\nLooking at (1,3) is a 2, (1,4) is a 1, (1,5) is a 1. (2,3) is a ., (2,5) is a ., (3,3) is a 1, (3,4) is a ., (3,5) is a 1.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should pick a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, so that revealing it could give me more information.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 7 is a 2. The adjacent squares are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). If I reveal (4,7), which is a 2, maybe I can get more clues.\n\nWait, but (4,7) is already revealed as a 2. So I can't reveal it again. Maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a 1, so that if it's safe, it might reveal more.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 7 is a 1. So (0,7) is a 1, meaning it has exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,8) is a 1, and (0,9) is a flag. So (0,7) is adjacent to (0,8) which is a 1, and (0,9) which is a flag. Wait, but (0,7) is a 1, so it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. If (0,9) is a flag, that's one bomb. So that's correct.\n\nI'm not seeing any obvious moves. Maybe I should try to find a square that's adjacent to a 1 and see if it's safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 9 is a 2. The adjacent squares are (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9). (0,8) is a 1, (0,9) is a flag, (1,8) is an F, (2,8) is a 1, (2,9) is a 2.\n\nWait, (1,9) is a 2, so it needs exactly two bombs adjacent. Let's count the flags around it. (0,9) is a flag, (1,8) is a flag. So that's two flags, which would mean two bombs. So (1,9) is a 2, which is correct. So no conflict there.\n\nI'm starting to think that maybe I should reveal a square that's adjacent to a 1, as that might be safer. Let's look for a square that's adjacent to a 1 and has no flags nearby.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5 is a ., which is unexplored. It's adjacent to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). I don't see any flags nearby, so maybe it's safe to reveal.\n\nAlternatively, row 9, column 1 is a 1. The adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (9,1) is a 1, so if I reveal (9,0), which is a ., maybe that's safe.\n\nWait, (9,0) is a . adjacent to (9,1) which is a 1. So if I reveal (9,0), and it's a 0, that would mean no bombs around it, which would help confirm that (9,1) is correct.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should pick a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers so that revealing it gives me more info.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 7 is a ., which is unexplored. It's adjacent to (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8). (6,7) is a flag, (7,6) is a 1, (7,8) is a ., (8,6) is a ., (8,7) is a ., (8,8) is a . So revealing (7,7) might help, but it's risky because it's near a flag.\n\nAlternatively, row 8, column 8 is a ., which is adjacent to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). But I don't see any numbers nearby, so it's hard to tell.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a 1 and has no flags nearby, making it likely to be a safe reveal.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 5 is a ., which is adjacent to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). (1,5) is a 1, so if I reveal (2,5), which is a ., maybe it's safe.\n\nWait, (2,5) is a . adjacent to (1,5) which is a 1. So if (2,5) is a 0, that would mean no bombs around it, which would help confirm that (1,5) is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's adjacent to a 2, to see if it can give me more info.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5 is a ., which is adjacent to (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). (3,5) is a 1, (4,4) is a ., (5,5) is a 1. So revealing (4,5) might help.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should pick a square that's in a corner or edge, as they have fewer adjacent squares, making it easier to determine if it's safe.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 0 is a ., which is adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (9,1). (9,1) is a 1, so if I reveal (9,0), it might be safe.\n\nAlternatively, row 0, column 0 is a ., which is adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (1,0) is a 1, so if I reveal (0,0), it might be safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a 1 and has no flags nearby, making it likely to be a safe reveal.\n\nWait, looking at row 5, column 5 again. It's adjacent to (1,5) which is a 1. So if I reveal (5,5), and it's a 0, that would confirm that (1,5) is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a 1 and a 2, so that revealing it can help both numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 5 is a ., which is adjacent to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,5) is a ., (3,4) is a 1, (3,6) is a ., (4,4) is a ., (4,5) is a ., (4,6) is a . So not much info.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should just pick a square that's adjacent to a 1 and see.\n\nLet me pick (9,0) to reveal. It's adjacent to (9,1) which is a 1. If (9,0) is a 0, then (9,1) is correctly flagged. If it's a 1, then there's a bomb nearby, but since (9,1) is a 1, it can't have more than one bomb adjacent.\n\nWait, but (9,0) is a . and (9,1) is a 1. So if I reveal (9,0), and it's a 0, that means no bombs around it, which would confirm that (9,1) is correct. If it's a 1, then there's a bomb adjacent, but since (9,1) is a 1, it can't have more than one bomb. So maybe (9,0) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (0,0). It's adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (1,0) is a 1, so if (0,0) is a 0, that would mean no bombs around it, which would help.\n\nBut I'm not sure. I think I'll go with revealing (9,0) because it's adjacent to a 1 and might be safe.\n\nWait, but (9,0) is at the bottom-left corner. Let me check the adjacent squares again. (9,0) is adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), and (9,1). (9,1) is a 1, so if (9,0) is a 0, then (9,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent, which would be somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (0,0). It's adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (1,0) is a 1, so if (0,0) is a 0, that would mean no bombs around it, which would help confirm that (1,0) is correct.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing (0,0). It's a corner, so fewer adjacent squares. If it's a 0, that would help. If it's a 1, then there's a bomb adjacent, but since (1,0) is a 1, it must be that (2,0) is a bomb, which is already flagged. So (0,0) being a 1 would make sense.\n\nWait, but (0,0) is a ., so it's unexplored. If I reveal it and it's a 1, that would mean there's exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (1,0) is a 1, so if (0,0) is a 1, then one of (0,1) or (1,1) must be a bomb. But (1,0) is a 1, which already has a bomb at (2,0). So (0,0) being a 1 would mean another bomb adjacent, but that would conflict with (1,0) being a 1. So (0,0) can't be a 1 because that would require two bombs adjacent to (1,0), which is a 1. Therefore, (0,0) must be a 0 or a bomb. But since there are 10 bombs, and some are already flagged, maybe (0,0) is a 0.\n\nWait, but I can't be sure. Maybe I should pick a different square.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 5, column 5 again. It's adjacent to (5,4), (5,6), (4,5), (6,5). (5,5) is a ., and (5,4) is a 1. So if I reveal (5,5) and it's a 0, that would mean no bombs around it, which would help confirm that (5,4) is correct.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should pick a square that's adjacent to a 2, so that revealing it can help reduce possibilities.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 7 is a 2. The adjacent squares are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). If I reveal (4,7), but it's already a 2. So maybe revealing one of its adjacent squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a 2 and a 1, making it more likely to be a bomb or safe.\n\nI'm getting stuck, so maybe I should just pick a square that's adjacent to a 1 and reveal it.\n\nLet me choose (0,1). It's adjacent to (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (0,0) is a ., (1,0) is a 1. If I reveal (0,1) and it's a 0, that would help. If it's a 1, then there's a bomb adjacent, but (1,0) is already a 1, so maybe (0,1) is a 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should pick (1,1). It's adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (1,0) is a 1, (2,0) is a flag. So if (1,1) is a 2, that would mean there are two bombs adjacent. But (1,1) is a ., so I don't know.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just pick a square that's adjacent to a 1 and see.\n\nI'll choose (2,1). It's adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). (1,0) is a 1, (2,0) is a flag, (3,2) is a flag. So if I reveal (2,1), and it's a 2, that would mean there are two bombs adjacent, which is correct because (2,0) and (3,2) are flags. But if it's a 1, then only one bomb is adjacent, which would conflict because there are two flags nearby.\n\nWait, but (2,1) is a ., so if I reveal it and it's a 2, that's correct. If it's a 1, then one of the flags is incorrect. But I can't remove flags because I can't place any new ones. So maybe revealing (2,1) is risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (3,1). It's a 2, so it's already revealed. So I can't do that.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing (5,5). It's in the middle, adjacent to (5,4) which is a 1. If (5,5) is a 0, that would confirm that (5,4) is correct. If it's a 1, then there's a bomb nearby, but (5,4) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. So revealing (5,5) might help.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should pick a different square.\n\nWait, looking at row 6, column 0 is a flag. Let's check if that's correct. The adjacent squares are (5,0), (5,1), (6,1). (5,0) is a ., (5,1) is a 1. If (6,0) is a flag, then (5,1) is a 1, which is satisfied. So that's correct.\n\nI think I've checked all the obvious possibilities. I'm not finding any conflicts, so maybe I should just pick a square that's adjacent to a 1 and see.\n\nI'll choose (5,5) to reveal. It's adjacent to (5,4) which is a 1. If (5,5) is a 0, that helps. If it's a 1, then there's a bomb nearby, but (5,4) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent.\n\nSo, my move is to reveal (5,5).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (5,5) to check if it's safe, as it's adjacent to a 1 at (5,4), which should have exactly one bomb nearby. If (5,5) is 0, it confirms (5,4) is correct. If it's 1, it indicates a bomb nearby, but (5,4) can only have one bomb, so it might help clarify.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 0, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n3 1 2 F 2 1 _ _ _ 1 F\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 F .\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 8, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The flags remaining are 0, which means all bombs should already be flagged. But wait, I see several F's on the board, so maybe some of those are flags, and some might be incorrect. I need to check if any of the current flags conflict with the numbers shown.\n\nLooking at the board, I'll go row by row to see if any numbers are conflicting with the flags.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- At (0,8) there's a 1, and (0,9) is an F. So, the 1 at (0,8) should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (0,9) is flagged, that should be the only bomb around it. The other adjacent squares to (0,8) are (0,7), (1,7), and (1,8). If any of these are bombs, that would make the count more than 1, which isn't allowed. So, I need to ensure that none of these other squares are bombs.\n\nMoving to row 1:\n- At (1,0) there's a 1, and the adjacent squares include (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0). There's an F at (2,0), so that's one bomb. The 1 at (1,0) can only have one bomb adjacent, which is (2,0). So, the other adjacent squares shouldn't have bombs. That means (0,0), (0,1), and (1,1) should be safe. But I need to check if any of these have numbers that might conflict.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n- (2,0) is an F, and (2,4) is a 1. The 1 at (2,4) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). But since (2,0) is an F, it's a bomb, but it's not adjacent to (2,4), so that's fine. So the 1 at (2,4) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. I need to see if any of those are already flagged or if there's a number that indicates a possible bomb.\n\nRow 3:\n- (3,0) is a 1, and (3,2) is an F. So the 1 at (3,0) has exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), and (4,0). (2,0) is an F, so that's the one bomb. The others should be safe. But I need to check if any of these have numbers that might indicate more bombs.\n\nRow 4:\n- (4,1) is a 1, and (4,5) is a 1. Let me check their adjacent squares to see if there are any flags nearby.\n\nRow 5:\n- (5,8) is an F, and (5,9) is a dot. The 1 at (5,8) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. So, the F at (5,8) is a bomb, but I need to check if the adjacent squares to (5,8) have any numbers that might conflict.\n\nRow 6:\n- (6,0) is an F, and (6,7), (6,8), (6,9) are F's. So that's four flags in row 6. Wait, but the total bombs are 10, and I see several F's already. Let me count the F's:\n\nLooking through the board:\n- Row 0: (0,9) is F\n- Row 1: (1,9) is F\n- Row 2: (2,0) is F\n- Row 3: (3,2) is F\n- Row 5: (5,8) is F\n- Row 6: (6,0), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9) are F's\nThat's 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +4 = 9 F's. But the total bombs are 10, so there should be one more F somewhere. Wait, maybe I missed one. Let me check again.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- Row 0: (0,9) F\n- Row 1: (1,9) F\n- Row 2: (2,0) F\n- Row 3: (3,2) F\n- Row 5: (5,8) F\n- Row 6: (6,0), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9) F's\nThat's 1+1+1+1+1+4=9. So there's one more bomb to flag.\n\nNow, I need to check if any of the current flags are conflicting with the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 9 is F. Let's see the adjacent squares to (1,9). The squares around it are (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), and (2,8), (2,9). (0,8) is a 1, and (0,9) is an F. So the 1 at (0,8) is adjacent to (0,9) which is an F, so that's one bomb. The 1 at (0,8) can't have more than one bomb adjacent. So, the other adjacent squares to (0,8) must be safe. That includes (0,7), (1,7), and (1,8). \n\nLooking at (1,8), it's an F. Wait, no, (1,8) is not an F. Wait, row 1 has (1,9) as F, but (1,8) is a dot. Wait, in the initial board, row 1 is: 1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2. So (1,8) is a dot, and (1,9) is F. So the 1 at (0,8) has (0,9) as F, which is one bomb. So the other adjacent squares (0,7), (1,7), (1,8) must be safe.\n\nNow, looking at row 1, column 8 is a dot, but it's adjacent to (1,9) which is an F. So (1,8) can't be a bomb because that would make the count at (0,8) exceed 1. Therefore, (1,8) must be safe. So maybe I can reveal (1,8) safely.\n\nWait, but the flags remaining are 0, so I can't place any new flags. So my options are to reveal a square or remove a flag. But I can only remove a flag if I place a flag on an already flagged square, but since flags are 0, maybe I should check if any flags are incorrect.\n\nLooking at row 6, there are four F's. Let's check if any of these are conflicting with numbers.\n\nFor example, (6,0) is an F. Let's check the adjacent squares. The squares around (6,0) are (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). \n\nLooking at row 5, column 0 is a dot, and row 5, column 1 is 1. The 1 at (5,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (5,1) are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). \n\nSince (6,0) is an F, that's one bomb. So the 1 at (5,1) can't have any other bombs adjacent. Therefore, the other squares around (5,1) must be safe. So (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,1), (6,2) must be safe. \n\nBut wait, (6,1) is a dot, and (6,2) is a dot. So if (6,0) is an F, it's a bomb, and that's the only bomb adjacent to (5,1). So that seems okay.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (6,7), which is an F. The adjacent squares are (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). \n\nLooking at row 5, column 8 is an F, which is a bomb. So (6,7) is an F, which would be another bomb adjacent to (5,8). But (5,8) is a 1, which can only have one bomb adjacent. If (5,8) is adjacent to both (6,7) and (5,9), which is a dot, then that would be a problem because (5,8) is a 1, meaning only one bomb adjacent. But (6,7) is an F, so that's a bomb, and (5,8) is an F, which is another bomb. Wait, no, (5,8) is an F, but (5,8) is a 1. Wait, no, (5,8) is an F, so it's a bomb. So the 1 at (5,8) is a bomb, which can't be because the 1 indicates adjacent bombs, not the square itself. Wait, no, the 1 is at (5,8), which is an F. That doesn't make sense because if (5,8) is an F, it's a bomb, but the number 1 indicates that there's one bomb adjacent to it. So that's a contradiction because the square itself is a bomb, but it's showing a 1, which should be the number of adjacent bombs. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. In Minesweeper, a square with a number indicates how many bombs are adjacent, not including itself. So if (5,8) is an F (a bomb), then the number at (5,8) should be a number indicating adjacent bombs, but it's actually a bomb. So that's a conflict. That means that (5,8) can't be a bomb because it's showing a 1, which is the count of adjacent bombs. Therefore, (5,8) must be a safe square with a 1, not a bomb. So the flag at (5,8) is incorrect and should be removed.\n\nSo, the move would be to remove the flag at (5,8). Since flags remaining are 0, I can't place a new flag, so I have to reveal a square or remove an incorrect flag.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be to remove the flag at (5,8), which is (x=5, y=8), with flag=true because I'm placing a flag on an already flagged square to remove it.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user says that to remove a flag, you have to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So the move would be (5,8) with flag=true, which would remove the flag there.\n\nSo, the explanation is that the flag at (5,8) is conflicting with the number 1, which indicates that it should have exactly one adjacent bomb, but (5,8) itself is a flag, which would mean it's a bomb, making the count incorrect. Therefore, removing this flag is necessary.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The flag at (5,8) is incorrectly placed because it's a bomb (F) but shows a 1, indicating it should have exactly one adjacent bomb. This is a conflict, so we remove the flag.\n\nMOVE: 5,8,true", "flags_remaining": 0, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n3 1 2 F 2 1 _ _ _ 1 F\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 F .\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 5, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board state and the game info.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has one flag remaining because the flags remaining are 1. So, I need to be careful where I place that last flag.\n\nLooking at the board, I see a lot of revealed numbers and some flagged squares (marked as F). My goal is to either reveal a safe square or place a flag where a bomb is. But I have to make sure that placing a flag doesn't conflict with the numbers already shown.\n\nLet me go through the board row by row to spot any obvious conflicts or places where I can safely place a flag.\n\nStarting with row 0: it has some numbers, but I don't see any immediate conflicts. The last two squares are F and 2, so maybe that's okay.\n\nRow 1 has a 1 at (1,0), which means there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. Looking around (1,0), the adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0). (0,0) and (0,1) are empty, (1,1) is 1, and (2,0) is F. Wait, (2,0) is flagged, so that might be the bomb adjacent to (1,0). Since (1,0) is a 1, and there's already a flag next to it, that should be the only bomb around it. So that seems okay.\n\nRow 2 has an F at (2,0), which I just considered. Then (2,4) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb around it. The adjacent squares would be (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Some of these are unexplored, so maybe that's something to look into later.\n\nRow 3 has a 1 at (3,0), which is adjacent to (2,0) which is an F. So that's probably the one bomb it needs. Then (3,2) is F, which is another flag. Then (3,4) is 1, so it needs one bomb around it. The adjacent squares include (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Not sure yet.\n\nRow 4 has some numbers, but nothing jumps out immediately.\n\nRow 5 has a 1 at (5,1), which is adjacent to (5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (5,0) is unexplored, (4,0) is unexplored, (5,2) is 1, so maybe the bomb is around there.\n\nRow 6 has F at (6,0), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). So that's four flags, but the total bombs are 10, and I have one flag left. So maybe some of these are correctly placed, but I need to check.\n\nRow 7 has a 1 at (7,1), which is adjacent to (6,0) which is F, so that's probably the one bomb it needs.\n\nRow 8 has a 1 at (8,1), which is adjacent to (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,0) is unexplored, (8,0) is unexplored, so maybe the bomb is there.\n\nRow 9 has a 1 at (9,1), which is adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,1) is 1, so maybe that's where the bomb is.\n\nNow, let me think about where I can place the last flag. I have to make sure that placing it doesn't conflict with any of the numbers shown.\n\nLooking at row 6, there are four Fs. Let me check each of them to see if they're correctly placed.\n\nStarting with (6,0): adjacent squares are (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). (5,1) is 1, which is satisfied by (6,0) being a flag. So that seems okay.\n\n(6,7): adjacent to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). (5,6) is 1, which would require exactly one bomb around it. If (6,7) is a flag, then that satisfies the 1 at (5,6). So that's good.\n\n(6,8): adjacent to (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). (5,8) is 2, so if (6,8) is a flag, that's one bomb. But (5,8) is 2, so there must be another bomb adjacent to it. Let me check around (5,8). The adjacent squares are (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). (6,7) and (6,8) are flags, so that's two bombs, which matches the 2 at (5,8). So that's correct.\n\n(6,9): adjacent to (5,8), (5,9), (6,8), (7,8), (7,9). (5,8) is 2, and (6,8) is a flag, so that's one bomb. (5,8) needs two, so there must be another bomb adjacent. Let me check (5,9). It's unexplored, so maybe that's the other bomb. So (6,9) being a flag is correct.\n\nNow, looking at row 3, (3,2) is F. Let's check the adjacent squares. (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (3,1) is 2, which means there should be exactly two bombs around it. So if (3,2) is a flag, that's one. Where's the other? Let's see: (2,1) is 1, (2,3) is unexplored, (4,1) is 1, (4,3) is unexplored. Maybe the other bomb is at (4,3). But I'm not sure yet.\n\nNow, looking for places where I can place the last flag without conflicting with the numbers.\n\nLet me check row 0, column 8 is 1, and column 9 is 2. Wait, (0,8) is 1, which means there's exactly one bomb around it. The adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). (0,7) is _, (0,9) is 2, (1,7) is _, (1,8) is F, (1,9) is 2. So the bomb could be at (1,8), which is F, so that satisfies the 1 at (0,8). So that's correct.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0 is 1, which is satisfied by (2,0) being F.\n\nNow, I have to find where to place the last flag. Let me look for a square that is adjacent to a number that requires exactly one bomb, and where that square is the only possible place for the bomb.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (6,0) is F, so that's one bomb. Since (5,1) is 1, that's the only bomb it needs. So I can't place another flag around (5,1) because that would make it have two bombs, which would conflict with the 1.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4 is 1. The adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (3,4) is 1, so maybe the bomb is at (3,5) or somewhere else. Not sure.\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 1. Adjacent squares include (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,4) is 1, so maybe the bomb is at (4,4) or (3,5).\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,1) is 1, so maybe the bomb is at (9,0) or (9,2). But I can't place a flag there because I have only one flag left and I don't know for sure.\n\nWait, let me check row 7, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0) is F, so that's the one bomb needed for (7,1). So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at row 8, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,1) is 2, so it needs two bombs. Wait, no, (8,1) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb. So the bomb must be in one of those adjacent squares. (7,1) is 2, which is a different tile, so maybe the bomb is at (7,0) or (9,0). But I can't be sure.\n\nI think I need to find a place where placing a flag would satisfy a 1 without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,2) is F, so that's the one bomb needed for (4,1). So that's correct.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 0 is F. That's already placed, so I don't need to do anything there.\n\nWait, let me check row 3, column 2 is F. The adjacent squares include (3,1) which is 2. So (3,1) is 2, meaning it needs two bombs around it. One is at (3,2), so there must be another bomb nearby. Let's check the adjacent squares of (3,1): (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) is F, (3,2) is F, so that's two bombs. So (3,1) is 2, which is satisfied. So that's correct.\n\nNow, I'm trying to find where to place the last flag. Maybe I can look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 3 is 1. The adjacent squares are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (5,2) is 1, so maybe the bomb is at (6,3) or somewhere else. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible spot for the bomb, because all other adjacent squares are either revealed or have flags.\n\nFor example, looking at row 0, column 8 is 1. The adjacent squares are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). (1,8) is F, so that's the one bomb. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: row 1, column 0 is 1, and (2,0) is F, so that's correct.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4 is 1. The adjacent squares include (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (3,4) is 1, so maybe the bomb is at (3,5) or (2,5). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb location, with all other adjacent squares either being numbers or flags.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,1) is 1, so maybe the bomb is at (9,0) or (9,2). But I can't be certain.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8, column 1 is 1. The adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,1) is 2, which needs two bombs. So if (8,1) is 1, then the bomb must be in one of the other squares. Maybe (9,0) is a bomb, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should try to find a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 3 is 1. The adjacent squares are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (3,2) is F, so that's the one bomb needed for (4,3). So that's correct.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible spot because all other adjacent squares are either numbers or have flags.\n\nWait, looking at row 5, column 6 is 1. The adjacent squares are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (5,5) is unexplored, (6,5) is 1, which is another number. So maybe the bomb is at (6,6) or (4,5). Not sure.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to find a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible spot for the bomb.\n\nWait, looking at row 6, column 6 is unexplored. It's adjacent to (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,6) is 1, so if I place a flag at (6,6), that would satisfy (5,6)'s 1. But I'm not sure if (6,6) is a bomb or not. Alternatively, maybe (6,6) is safe, but I can't tell.\n\nWait, but I have only one flag left, so I have to be careful. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb location, with all other adjacent squares being numbers or flags.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 5 is adjacent to (3,4) which is 1. So (3,5) could be a bomb. Let me check the adjacent squares of (3,5): (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (3,4) is 1, so if (3,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy it. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9, column 0: adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (9,1). (8,1) is 1, so if (9,0) is a bomb, that would satisfy (8,1)'s 1. But I can't be certain.\n\nI think I'm going in circles. Maybe I should consider revealing a square instead of placing a flag. Since I have one flag left, maybe I can reveal a square that's likely safe based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0 is unexplored. It's adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (1,0) is 1, which is satisfied by (2,0) being F. So (0,0) could be safe. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 0, column 1: adjacent to (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (1,0) is 1, which is satisfied by (2,0). So maybe (0,1) is safe.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a 2 and see if placing a flag there would satisfy it.\n\nWait, looking at row 1, column 8 is F. The adjacent squares include (0,8) which is 1, satisfied by (1,8). So that's correct.\n\nI'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to find a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb location.\n\nWait, looking at row 5, column 8 is 2. The adjacent squares are (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). (6,8) and (6,9) are F, so that's two bombs, which satisfies the 2 at (5,8). So that's correct.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look at row 3, column 7. It's unexplored. Adjacent to (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). Not sure.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to place the flag at a square that is adjacent to a 1 and is the only possible bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 0: adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (9,1). (8,1) is 1, so if (9,0) is a bomb, that would satisfy it. So maybe I can place a flag at (9,0).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe (9,2) is a bomb.\n\nWait, let me check row 9, column 2. It's adjacent to (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3). (8,1) is 1, so if (9,2) is a bomb, that would satisfy (8,1)'s 1. But I can't be certain.\n\nI think I have to take a guess. Since I have one flag left, and I need to place it correctly, I'll try to find the most likely spot.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 5: adjacent to (3,4) which is 1. So if I place a flag at (3,5), that would satisfy (3,4)'s 1. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, column 3: adjacent to (5,4) which is 1. So if I place a flag at (5,3), that would satisfy (5,4)'s 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 6, column 6. It's adjacent to (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,6) is 1, so if (6,6) is a bomb, that would satisfy (5,6)'s 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nI think I'll go with placing a flag at (3,5) because it's adjacent to a 1 and might satisfy that.\n\nWait, but (3,4) is 1, so placing a flag at (3,5) would make that 1 correct. Let me check the adjacent squares of (3,5): (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (3,4) is 1, so yes, that would satisfy it.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure, but I think that's a good move.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (3,5) because it's adjacent to a 1 at (3,4), which needs exactly one bomb nearby.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the game info. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Flags remaining are 0, which means I can't place any new flags. I can only reveal tiles or remove existing flags.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each step of the analysis as instructed.\n\n1. **Check all revealed numbers against existing flags**: I need to look for any conflicts where a number might indicate a certain number of adjacent bombs, but the flags placed don't match that. For example, if a tile shows '1' and there are already two flags around it, that's a conflict because the number says exactly one bomb is adjacent.\n\nLooking at the board, let's go row by row.\n\n- **Row 0**: The tiles revealed are 1, 2, and F at (0,8) and (0,9). Wait, actually, looking at the board state, row 0 has _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F. So (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2. The F is at (0,9), but wait, the board shows F at (0,9). So that's a flag. Now, the number at (0,8) is 1, which means it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent tiles to (0,8) would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). But (0,7) is _, (1,7) is _, (1,8) is F, and (1,9) is 2. So the flag at (1,8) is adjacent to (0,8). So the number 1 at (0,8) should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The flag at (1,8) is one, so that's okay. But I should check if there's another bomb adjacent. Wait, but the flag is at (1,8), so that's the only bomb. So that seems okay.\n\n- **Row 1**: The tiles are 1,1,1,2,1,1,_,_,F,2. The F is at (1,8). The number at (1,9) is 2. So the number 2 at (1,9) has adjacent tiles: (0,8), (0,9), (1,8). (0,8) is 1, which is a number, so no bomb. (0,9) is F, which is a flag, so that's one bomb. (1,8) is F, another flag, which would be two bombs. So the number at (1,9) is 2, and it has two flags adjacent. That's correct, so no conflict.\n\n- **Row 2**: The tiles are F, ., ., ., 1, _, _, 1, 2, 2. The F is at (2,0). The number at (2,4) is 1. Its adjacent tiles would include (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). I don't know what's in those, but no flags nearby that I can see, so maybe no conflict.\n\n- **Row 3**: 1,2,F,2,1,F,_,_,1,F. The F's are at (3,2) and (3,5) and (3,9). The number at (3,0) is 1. Its adjacent tiles: (2,0) is F, so that's one bomb. The number 1 at (3,0) should have exactly one bomb adjacent, which it does. So that's okay.\n\n- **Row 4**: _,1,.,1,_,_,_,1,2,.. The number at (4,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,2) is F, so that's one bomb. So the number 1 at (4,1) is okay.\n\n- **Row 5**: _,1,1,1,_,1,1,2,.,.. The number at (5,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (6,0) is F, so that's one bomb. So the number 1 at (5,1) is okay.\n\n- **Row 6**: F,_,_,_,_,1,.,F,F,F. The F's are at (6,0), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). The number at (6,5) is 1. Its adjacent tiles: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). I don't see any flags adjacent to (6,5), so that's okay.\n\n- **Row 7**: _,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,_,_. The number at (7,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (6,0) is F, (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0) is F, so that's one bomb. So the number 1 at (7,1) is okay.\n\n- **Row 8**: _,1,.,.,1,_,_,_,_,_. The number at (8,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). I don't see any flags here, so that's okay.\n\n- **Row 9**: _,1,.,.,1,_,_,_,_,_. The number at (9,1) is 1. Adjacent tiles: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,0) which is out of bounds, etc. No flags here, so okay.\n\nSo, from the first step, I don't see any obvious conflicts where a number has more flags adjacent than it should. So that's good.\n\n2. **Look for obvious conflicts**: As above, I don't see any. For example, a '1' with two flags adjacent would be a conflict, but I don't see that.\n\n3. **Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs**: The game has 10 bombs, and the board shows several flags. Let me count the flags.\n\nLooking through the board:\n\n- Row 0: F at (0,9)\n- Row 1: F at (1,8)\n- Row 2: F at (2,0)\n- Row 3: F at (3,2), (3,5), (3,9)\n- Row 4: No F\n- Row 5: No F\n- Row 6: F at (6,0), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)\n- Row 7: No F\n- Row 8: No F\n- Row 9: No F\n\nLet me count them:\n\n(0,9) \u2192 1\n(1,8) \u2192 2\n(2,0) \u21923\n(3,2) \u21924\n(3,5) \u21925\n(3,9) \u21926\n(6,0) \u21927\n(6,7) \u21928\n(6,8) \u21929\n(6,9) \u219210\n\nWait, that's 10 flags, but the game info says flags remaining are 0. So all 10 bombs are accounted for with flags. But wait, the game has 10 bombs, and all flags placed are 10. So that suggests that all bombs are already flagged. But I need to make sure that each flag is correctly placed on a bomb.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the user can't place any new flags because flags remaining are 0. So any move now has to be either revealing a tile or removing a flag.\n\nBut the goal is to reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. Since all flags are placed, perhaps the next step is to reveal tiles to confirm that all bombs are correctly flagged.\n\nBut I need to be careful because if I reveal a tile that's a bomb, the game ends. So I should look for tiles that are definitely safe to reveal, perhaps those that are numbered and have all their adjacent bombs accounted for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some flags are incorrectly placed, and I need to remove them, but since I can't place new flags, I can only remove existing ones. But I have to be cautious because if I remove a flag that's correctly placed, I might have to place another, but I can't because flags are 0.\n\nWait, but the rules say that to remove a flag, I can make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So if I think a flag is incorrectly placed, I can remove it by flagging it again, which would remove it.\n\nBut I have to make sure that after removing, the numbers still make sense.\n\nBut maybe the better approach is to look for a tile that is definitely safe to reveal. For example, a tile that is adjacent to a number that has all its bombs accounted for.\n\nLooking at the board, let's see:\n\nFor example, the tile at (0,8) is 1. It's adjacent to (1,8), which is a flag. So that's one bomb. So the 1 is satisfied. Therefore, the other adjacent tiles around (0,8) should not have any bombs. So (0,7) is _, (1,7) is _, (1,9) is 2. So perhaps (0,7) is safe to reveal because the number at (0,8) says only one bomb, which is at (1,8). So (0,7) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (1,9), which is 2. It's adjacent to (0,8)=1, (0,9)=F, (1,8)=F. So two flags, which matches the 2. So that's correct. Therefore, the other adjacent tiles around (1,9) should not have any bombs. So (2,8) and (2,9) should be safe? Wait, (2,8) is 1, and (2,9) is 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a tile that is adjacent to a number that has all its required bombs already flagged. For example, the number at (3,0) is 1, and it's adjacent to (2,0)=F, which is one bomb. So that's correct. Therefore, the other adjacent tiles around (3,0) should be safe. So (3,1) is 2, which is a number, but perhaps the tiles around (3,1) could be checked.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (6,5)=1. It's adjacent to (6,0)=F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent tiles around (6,5) should be safe. So (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). So perhaps revealing (5,5) would be safe, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since all flags are placed, maybe I should look for a tile that is definitely safe because all possible bombs around it are already flagged. For example, if a tile is adjacent to a number that has all its bombs accounted for, then the tile is safe.\n\nLooking at (0,7): adjacent to (0,8)=1, which has one flag at (1,8). So (0,7) should be safe because the only bomb adjacent to (0,8) is at (1,8). So (0,7) is safe to reveal.\n\nSo I can make a move to reveal (0,7). Let me check the coordinates: x=0, y=7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (0,7) is safe, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me check other possibilities.\n\nAnother approach: look for tiles that are numbered and have all their adjacent flags accounted for, so their other adjacent tiles must be safe.\n\nFor example, (1,9)=2, which has two flags adjacent. So all other adjacent tiles must be safe. So (2,8) and (2,9) should be safe. But (2,8) is 1, and (2,9) is 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If (1,9)=2 has two flags, then the tiles around it shouldn't have any more bombs. So (2,8)=1 must have exactly one bomb adjacent. So perhaps (2,7) is a bomb, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a tile that's surrounded by numbers that have all their bombs accounted for. For example, (3,1)=2. It's adjacent to (3,0)=1, which has a flag at (2,0). So (3,1)=2 needs two bombs adjacent. One is at (2,0)=F, so there must be another bomb adjacent. Let's see: adjacent tiles to (3,1) are (2,0)=F, (2,1)=., (2,2)=., (3,0)=1, (3,2)=F, (4,0)=., (4,1)=1, (4,2)=.. So the flags at (2,0) and (3,2) are two bombs. So the number at (3,1)=2 is satisfied. Therefore, the other adjacent tiles around (3,1) should not have any bombs. So (2,1), (2,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) should be safe. So perhaps revealing (2,1) is safe.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Let me check another area.\n\nLooking at (5,1)=1. It's adjacent to (6,0)=F, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent tiles should be safe. So (5,0), (5,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (6,1), (6,2) should be safe. So revealing (5,0) would be safe.\n\nWait, but (5,0) is _, so maybe it's safe to reveal.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (7,1)=1. It's adjacent to (6,0)=F, so that's one bomb. So the other adjacent tiles should be safe. So (7,0), (7,2), (6,1), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2) should be safe. So revealing (7,0) would be safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure if any of these are the best options.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a tile that is adjacent to multiple numbers, all of which have their required bombs accounted for, making that tile safe.\n\nFor example, (6,1) is adjacent to (6,0)=F and (7,1)=1. Since (7,1)=1 has one bomb at (6,0), the other adjacent tiles around (7,1) should be safe. So (6,1) is adjacent to (6,0)=F and (7,1)=1, but also to (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the tile at (0,7). It's adjacent to (0,8)=1, which has one bomb at (1,8). So (0,7) should be safe because the only bomb adjacent to (0,8) is at (1,8). Therefore, (0,7) is safe to reveal.\n\nSo I think the safest move is to reveal (0,7). Let me check the coordinates again: x=0, y=7.\n\nWait, but in the board state, row 0 is:\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n\nSo (0,7) is _, and (0,8)=1, (0,9)=2 and F.\n\nSo yes, revealing (0,7) should be safe because the number at (0,8)=1 has its one bomb at (1,8)=F.\n\nTherefore, I'll make the move to reveal (0,7).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The tile at (0,7) is safe to reveal because it is adjacent to (0,8), which has a value of 1. This 1 indicates exactly one bomb in the surrounding eight tiles, and the only adjacent flag is at (1,8). Therefore, (0,7) must be safe.\n\nMOVE: 0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 0, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n3 1 2 F 2 1 F _ _ 1 F\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the game info.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The flags remaining are 0, which means I can't place any new flags without removing an existing one. But I can still reveal tiles.\n\nLooking at the board, I see several numbers and some flagged squares (marked as F). My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. Since I can't place new flags right now, I should focus on revealing tiles that are likely safe or that could give me more information about the board.\n\nI'll go through each row and see if there are any obvious tiles to reveal. Let's start from the top.\n\nRow 0: The first few tiles are empty, then there's a 1 at (0,8) and a 2 at (0,9). These numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent. Since (0,8) is a 1, it means there's exactly one bomb in the surrounding 8 tiles. But I can't see any flags around it yet, so maybe revealing nearby tiles could help.\n\nRow 1: It starts with three 1s, then a 2, followed by a 1, an empty, and ends with F and a 2. The F at (1,9) is a flag, but I can't place any more. Maybe I can check around the numbers here. For example, the 2 at (1,4) might have bombs around it, but without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nRow 2: There's an F at (2,0), followed by some empty and a 1 at (2,4). The 1 indicates one bomb nearby. Maybe the tiles around it can be checked.\n\nRow 3: Starts with a 1, then a 2, an F, a 2, a 1, an F, and so on. This row has several numbers and flags. The F at (3,2) and (3,6) are already placed. The 2 at (3,3) might indicate two bombs nearby, but I'm not sure where.\n\nRow 4: Some empty tiles, a 1, and so on. Not much info here yet.\n\nRow 5: A few 1s and 2s, but again, not enough info.\n\nRow 6: Starts with an F, then some empty, a 1, and three Fs at the end. This might be a good area to look because there are multiple flags, but I can't place any more.\n\nRow 7: A 1, a 2, and some 1s. Maybe the 2 at (7,2) could be useful.\n\nRow 8: Some 1s and empty tiles.\n\nRow 9: A 1 and some empty tiles.\n\nNow, considering the flags remaining are 0, I can't add any new flags. So I need to reveal a tile that's likely safe or gives me more info.\n\nLooking at row 0, the tile at (0,0) is empty. Revealing it might show a number or a bomb. If it's a number, it could help me understand the surrounding area. But if it's a bomb, the game ends. Since I don't have any flags left, maybe it's safer to look for tiles that are adjacent to numbers which already have some flags, reducing the risk.\n\nFor example, in row 0, the tile at (0,8) is a 1, meaning one bomb is around it. The adjacent tiles include (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), and (1,8). (0,9) is a 2, which is already revealed. (1,8) is an F, so that's a flag. So the 1 at (0,8) has one flag adjacent, meaning there can't be another bomb around it because the number is 1. Therefore, the other adjacent tiles must be safe. So maybe I can reveal (0,7) because it's adjacent to a 1 and a flag, making it likely safe.\n\nWait, let me think again. The 1 at (0,8) has exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (1,8) is an F (a flag), that's one bomb. Therefore, all other adjacent tiles to (0,8) must be safe. So (0,7), (1,7), and (1,9) must be safe. But (1,9) is a 2, which is already revealed, so that's fine. So revealing (0,7) would be safe because it can't be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 1, the tile at (1,0) is a 1. Its adjacent tiles include (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0). (2,0) is an F, so that's one bomb. Since (1,0) is a 1, that's the only bomb adjacent, so the other tiles around it must be safe. Therefore, (0,0), (0,1), and (1,1) are safe. So revealing (0,0) would be safe.\n\nBut wait, if I reveal (0,0), which is currently empty, it might show a number or be empty. If it's a number, it could help. If it's empty, it might reveal a cluster of empty tiles. Alternatively, if I reveal (0,7), which is adjacent to a 1 and a flag, it's definitely safe because the 1's only adjacent bomb is the flag at (1,8).\n\nSo perhaps revealing (0,7) is a good move because it's safe and could open up more information around the 1 at (0,8).\n\nAnother option is to look at row 3, which has several flags and numbers. The tile at (3,0) is a 1, adjacent to (2,0) which is an F. So the 1 at (3,0) has one bomb, which is the F at (2,0). Therefore, the other adjacent tiles around (3,0) must be safe. So (3,1), (2,1), and (4,0) are safe. Revealing (3,1) could be a good move.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that gives me as much information as revealing (0,7). Alternatively, maybe looking at row 6, which has multiple Fs. The tile at (6,0) is an F, and the tiles around it could be checked, but without flags, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, another thought: in row 0, the tile at (0,9) is a 2. It's adjacent to (0,8) which is a 1 and an F at (1,8). So the 2 at (0,9) has two bombs adjacent. One is the F at (1,8), so the other must be somewhere else. The possible tiles are (0,8) which is a 1, so that can't be a bomb. Therefore, the other bomb must be at (1,9) or (0,10) but wait, the board is 10x10, so (0,9) is the last column. So the adjacent tiles are (0,8), (1,8), (1,9). (1,8) is F, so that's one bomb. The other must be either (1,9) or (0,8). But (0,8) is a 1, which can't be a bomb because it's revealed. Therefore, the other bomb must be at (1,9). But (1,9) is a 2, which is a revealed number, so it's safe. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The 2 at (0,9) must have two bombs adjacent, but the only possible is (1,8) as F and perhaps (1,9). But (1,9) is a 2, which can't be a bomb. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, (1,9) is a 2, which is a number, so it's safe. Therefore, the 2 at (0,9) must have two bombs adjacent. One is (1,8) as F, the other must be somewhere else. Maybe (1,9) is not the bomb, so perhaps (0,10) but that's beyond the board. Or (1,10), which is also beyond. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the adjacent tiles for (0,9):\n\nAdjacent tiles are:\n(0,8), (1,8), (1,9). That's it because it's the top-right corner.\n\nSo the 2 at (0,9) must have two bombs in these three tiles. One is (1,8) which is F, so that's one bomb. The other must be either (0,8) or (1,9). But (0,8) is a 1, which is a number, so it's safe. Therefore, (1,9) must be a bomb. But (1,9) is a 2, which is a number, not a bomb. That's a contradiction. So that means my assumption is wrong. Therefore, the 2 at (0,9) must have two bombs adjacent, but only one is possible (the F at (1,8)). So perhaps the 2 at (0,9) is incorrect, but that can't be because the game wouldn't have wrong numbers. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the board state. Let me check the original board again.\n\nLooking back, row 0 is: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F. So (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2, and (0,10) doesn't exist because it's a 10x10 board, so columns 0-9. So the adjacent tiles to (0,9) are (0,8), (1,8), and (1,9). (1,8) is F, so that's one bomb. The 2 at (0,9) needs two bombs, so the other must be at (1,9). But (1,9) is a 2, which is a number, not a bomb. So that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, maybe (1,9) is a bomb, but it's flagged? No, (1,9) is a 2, which is a number, so it's revealed and safe. So that can't be. Therefore, the only possibility is that (0,9) is a 2, but only one bomb is adjacent, which is (1,8). That would mean the 2 is wrong, which can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading the board.\n\nWait, looking again, row 1 is: 1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2. Wait, the last two tiles are F and 2. So (1,8) is F, (1,9) is 2. So (0,9)'s adjacent tiles are (0,8)=1, (1,8)=F, and (1,9)=2. So the 2 at (0,9) has two bombs adjacent, but only one is present (the F at (1,8)). Therefore, the other must be somewhere else, but I can't see it. This suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and maybe (0,9) is a bomb, but that can't be because it's a number.\n\nWait, no, (0,9) is a 2, so it's a number, not a bomb. Therefore, it must have exactly two bombs adjacent. The only possible is (1,8) and (1,9). But (1,9) is a 2, which is safe. So this is confusing. Maybe I should move on and look for other clues.\n\nLooking at row 3, the tile at (3,0) is a 1, adjacent to (2,0) which is F. So the 1 at (3,0) has one bomb, which is the F at (2,0). Therefore, the other adjacent tiles around (3,0) must be safe. So (3,1), (2,1), and (4,0) are safe. Revealing (3,1) would be safe and could open up more info.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, which has several Fs. The tile at (6,0) is F, and the tiles around it could be checked, but without flags, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, another approach: since flags remaining are 0, I can't place any new flags. So I should focus on revealing tiles that are definitely safe or give me more info. Let's look for tiles that are adjacent to numbers which already have some flags, making them safe.\n\nFor example, in row 1, the tile at (1,0) is a 1. Its adjacent tiles include (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0). (2,0) is F, so that's one bomb. Since (1,0) is a 1, the other tiles must be safe. So revealing (0,0), (0,1), or (1,1) would be safe.\n\nRevealing (0,0) could be a good move because it's in the top-left corner, and if it's a number, it could help me understand the surrounding area.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (0,7) because it's adjacent to a 1 and a flag, making it safe.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing (0,0) because it's a corner and could open up more info if it's a number.\n\nWait, but (0,0) is in row 0, column 0. Let me check the adjacent tiles. It's adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). If (0,0) is a number, it could tell me how many bombs are around it. If it's empty, it might reveal a cluster.\n\nBut considering that (1,0) is a 1, and (2,0) is F, revealing (0,0) would be safe because (1,0) has only one bomb at (2,0), so (0,0) can't be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, revealing (0,0) is safe and could provide useful information.\n\nSo my next move would be to reveal (0,0).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (0,0) is safe because it's adjacent to a 1 at (1,0) which already has a flag at (2,0), meaning no other bombs are nearby. Revealing this tile could provide more information about the surrounding area.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 0, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n3 1 2 F 2 1 F _ _ 1 F\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 9, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board state and the game info. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The flags remaining are 0, which means I can't place any new flags; I can only reveal tiles or remove existing flags. But wait, the rules say that to remove a flag, I have to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So if I suspect a flag is incorrectly placed, I might need to remove it, but I have to be careful because I can't place new flags anymore.\n\nFirst, I should check all the revealed numbers against the existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. Let's go through each row and see where the numbers and flags are.\n\nLooking at row 0: The last two tiles are F (flagged) and 2. So position (0,8) is flagged, and (0,9) is a 2. That means the tile at (0,9) has two bombs adjacent to it. But wait, (0,8) is flagged, so that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb adjacent to (0,9). Let me check the surrounding tiles of (0,9). The adjacent tiles would be (0,8) which is flagged, (1,8) which is F, (1,9) which is 2. Hmm, but (1,9) is a 2, so maybe it's not a bomb. Wait, no, (1,9) is a 2, so it's a number, not a bomb. So the other bomb adjacent to (0,9) must be somewhere else. Let me check the tiles around (0,9): up is nothing because it's the top row, down is (1,9), left is (0,8), right is nothing. So the other bomb must be either (1,8) or (1,9). But (1,9) is a 2, so maybe (1,8) is a bomb? But (1,8) is flagged as well. Wait, that can't be because (0,9) is a 2, and if both (0,8) and (1,8) are flags, that would make two bombs adjacent to (0,9), which is correct. But (1,8) is also a flag, so maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, but looking at row 1, the last tile is 2, which is (1,9). So (1,9) is a 2, meaning it has two bombs adjacent. Let's check its adjacent tiles. Up is (0,9), which is 2, so not a bomb. Down is (2,9), which is 2. Left is (1,8), which is F. Right is nothing. So the two bombs adjacent to (1,9) must be (1,8) and maybe (2,9). But (2,9) is 2, so that's not a bomb. So perhaps (2,8) is a bomb? Or maybe (1,10), but that's beyond the board. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me look elsewhere. In row 3, there's a tile at (3,2) which is F. That's a flag. Let me check the numbers around it. For example, (3,1) is 2, so it has two bombs adjacent. The adjacent tiles to (3,1) are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Wait, (3,2) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So (3,1) being 2 means there must be another bomb adjacent. Let me see if any of the other tiles around (3,1) are numbers or flags.\n\nLooking at (3,0), it's 1. So (3,0) is 1, meaning it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent tiles to (3,0) are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (3,1) is 2, so it's a number, not a bomb. So the bomb adjacent to (3,0) must be either (2,0) or (2,1) or (4,0) or (4,1). But (3,2) is a flag, which is adjacent to (3,1), so that's one bomb for (3,1). So (3,1) needs another bomb. Let me check if any of the surrounding tiles are flagged or numbers.\n\nWait, (2,1) is F, which is a flag. So (2,1) is a flag, which is a bomb. So that would be the second bomb for (3,1). Because (3,1) is 2, and it's adjacent to (3,2) which is a flag and (2,1) which is a flag, that makes two bombs, which fits the 2. So that seems okay.\n\nBut wait, (3,0) is 1, and it's adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,1) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So (3,0)'s adjacent bomb is (2,1). That works because (3,0) is 1, so only one bomb. So that seems okay.\n\nNow, looking at row 6, there are several F's. Let's see: (6,0) is F, (6,7) is F, (6,8) is F, (6,9) is F. That's four flags in row 6. But the total bombs are 10, and I can see several F's already on the board. Let me count the flags: row 0 has two F's at (0,8) and (0,9) is 2, so maybe (0,8) is a flag. Wait, looking back: row 0 is \"_ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\". So (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2, and (0,10) is F? Wait, no, the board is 10x10, so indices go from 0 to 9. So (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2, and (0,10) doesn't exist. So maybe I misread. Let me correct that.\n\nRow 0: columns 0-9. So (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2. Then, looking at row 1: ends with F and 2. So (1,9) is 2, and (1,10) doesn't exist. So maybe I'm getting the columns wrong. Let me clarify:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\nWait, no, that can't be right because each row should have 10 columns. So perhaps the formatting is off. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nWait, the user provided the board state as:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n3 1 2 F 2 1 F _ _ 1 F\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 . F F F\n7 _ 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _ _\n8 _ 1 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n9 _ 1 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nWait, each row has 10 columns, so for row 0, it's: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So the 10th column is (0,9). So (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2. But then, in row 0, the last entry is F, which would be (0,9), but that's 2. So maybe the formatting is that each row is written as \"0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\", meaning that the 9th column is 2, and the 10th is F? But that can't be because the board is 10x10, so each row has 10 columns. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting, and each row is actually 10 columns, so the F is at (0,9). Let me adjust that.\n\nSo, row 0: columns 0-9: _,_,_,_,_,_,_,1,2,F. So (0,8)=1, (0,9)=F.\n\nRow 1: columns 0-9: 1,1,2,1,1,_,_,F,.,2. Wait, that's 10 columns: positions 0-9. So (1,8)=F, (1,9)=2.\n\nRow 2: F,.,.,.,1,.,.,1,2,2. So (2,0)=F, (2,4)=1, etc.\n\nRow 3: 1,2,F,2,1,F,_,_,1,F. So (3,2)=F, (3,5)=F, (3,9)=F.\n\nRow 4: _,1,.,1,_,_,_,1,2,.. So (4,8)=2, (4,9)=.\n\nRow 5: _,1,1,1,_,1,1,2,.,.. So (5,8)=2, (5,9)=.\n\nRow 6: F,.,.,.,.,1,.,F,F,F. So (6,0)=F, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=F.\n\nRow 7: _,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,_,_. So (7,1)=1, (7,2)=2, etc.\n\nRow 8: _,1,.,.,1,_,_,_,_,_. So (8,1)=1, (8,4)=1.\n\nRow 9: _,1,.,.,1,_,_,_,_,_. So (9,1)=1, (9,4)=1.\n\nOkay, now that I have the correct positions, let me recount the flags. Each F is a flag, so let's count them:\n\nRow 0: (0,9)=F \u2192 1\nRow 1: (1,8)=F \u2192 2\nRow 2: (2,0)=F \u2192 3\nRow 3: (3,2)=F, (3,5)=F, (3,9)=F \u2192 6,7,8\nRow 6: (6,0)=F, (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=F \u2192 9,10,11,12\n\nWait, but the game info says flags remaining: 0, and bombs:10. So total flags placed should be 10, but I'm counting 12 here. That can't be right. So perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 0: (0,9)=F \u2192 1\nRow 1: (1,8)=F \u2192 2\nRow 2: (2,0)=F \u2192 3\nRow 3: (3,2)=F, (3,5)=F, (3,9)=F \u2192 6,7,8\nRow 6: (6,0)=F, (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=F \u2192 9,10,11,12\n\nWait, that's 12 flags, but the game info says flags remaining:0, which implies that all 10 flags have been placed. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the board. Maybe some of the F's are actually part of the numbers. Wait, no, the legend says F is a flagged space. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but I have to work with what's given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board state is correct, and the flags remaining is 0, meaning that all 10 flags have been placed, but I count 12 F's. That suggests that perhaps some of the F's are actually numbers or other symbols. Wait, looking again:\n\nRow 0: ... 1 2 F \u2192 so (0,8)=1, (0,9)=2, (0,10)=F? No, because it's 10 columns, so (0,9)=F, but the text shows \"1 2 F\", which would mean (0,8)=1, (0,9)=2, but that's 9 columns. So perhaps the formatting is off, and each row is 10 columns, with the last being F. So (0,9)=F.\n\nSimilarly, row 1: ... F . 2 \u2192 so (1,8)=F, (1,9)=2.\n\nSo total flags:\n\nRow 0: (0,9)=F \u2192 1\nRow 1: (1,8)=F \u2192 2\nRow 2: (2,0)=F \u21923\nRow 3: (3,2)=F, (3,5)=F, (3,9)=F \u21926,7,8\nRow 6: (6,0)=F, (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=F \u21929,10,11,12\n\nSo that's 12 flags, but the game allows only 10. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the board state. Alternatively, perhaps some of the F's are actually numbers. For example, in row 6, the last four are F's, but maybe they're numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the F's in row 6 are correct, but that would exceed the flag limit. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nBut regardless, I have to proceed. So perhaps the flags are correctly placed, and the count is 10. Maybe I miscounted. Let me try again:\n\nRow 0: (0,9)=F \u21921\nRow 1: (1,8)=F \u21922\nRow 2: (2,0)=F \u21923\nRow 3: (3,2)=F, (3,5)=F, (3,9)=F \u21926,7,8\nRow 6: (6,0)=F, (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=F \u21929,10,11,12\n\nThat's 12, which is more than the 10 allowed. So perhaps the board state is incorrect, but I have to work with it. Maybe some F's are actually numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that there are 10 flags, so I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nNow, I need to check for conflicts between the numbers and the flags. Let's start with row 0, column 9: it's F. The adjacent tiles would be (0,8)=1 and (1,9)=2. So (0,8) is 1, which means it has one bomb adjacent. Since (0,9) is flagged, that accounts for the one bomb. So (0,8)=1 is satisfied.\n\nLooking at (1,9)=2. Its adjacent tiles include (0,9)=F, (1,8)=F, (2,9)=2, and others. So (1,9) is 2, meaning two bombs adjacent. It has two flags adjacent: (0,9) and (1,8). So that's two bombs, which fits. So no conflict there.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 9: F. Its adjacent tiles include (3,8)=1 and (2,9)=2. (3,8)=1, so it has one bomb adjacent. Since (3,9)=F, that accounts for the one bomb. So (3,8)=1 is satisfied.\n\nNow, looking at row 6, which has four F's: (6,0), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). Let's check the numbers around them.\n\nStarting with (6,0)=F. Its adjacent tiles are (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). (7,0) is _, (7,1)=1. So (7,1)=1 means it has one bomb adjacent. If (6,0) is a flag, that's one bomb. So (7,1)=1 is satisfied if (6,0) is a bomb. But wait, (7,1)=1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (6,0) is a bomb, then (7,1) is okay. But let's check other adjacent tiles to (6,0). (5,0) is _, (5,1)=1, (6,1)=_, (7,0)=_, (7,1)=1. So (5,1)=1 is adjacent to (6,0)=F, so that's one bomb, which is correct.\n\nNow, looking at (6,7)=F. Its adjacent tiles include (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6)=1, (6,8)=F, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=2, (7,8)=_, etc. So (6,6)=1 is adjacent to (6,7)=F, which is one bomb. That's okay. (7,7)=2 is adjacent to (6,7)=F, so that's one bomb. So (7,7)=2 needs another bomb adjacent. Let's see where that could be. The adjacent tiles to (7,7)=2 are (6,6)=1, (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F, (7,6)=1, (7,8)=_, (8,6)=_, (8,7)=_, (8,8)=_. So (6,7) and (6,8) are flags, which are two bombs. But (7,7)=2 needs exactly two bombs adjacent. So that's okay.\n\nSimilarly, (6,8)=F is adjacent to (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7)=F, (6,9)=F, (7,7)=2, (7,8)=_, (7,9)=_. So (7,7)=2 is adjacent to (6,7)=F and (6,8)=F, which are two bombs, satisfying the 2.\n\nNow, (6,9)=F is adjacent to (5,8), (5,9), (6,8)=F, (7,8), (7,9). (5,9) is _, (7,9) is _. So (6,9)=F is a bomb, and any adjacent numbers must account for it.\n\nLooking at (5,8)=2. Its adjacent tiles include (5,7), (5,9), (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=F, (4,7), (4,8)=1, (4,9)=.. So (5,8)=2 is adjacent to (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), which are three flags. But (5,8)=2 can only have two bombs adjacent. So this is a conflict. Because (5,8)=2 is adjacent to three flags: (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). That's three bombs, but (5,8)=2 requires exactly two. So this is a problem. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (5,8)=2, it's adjacent to three F's: (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). That's three bombs, but (5,8)=2 can only have two. So one of these must not be a bomb. Therefore, at least one of these flags is incorrectly placed.\n\nSo, I need to figure out which of these F's is not a bomb. Let's look at other numbers around these F's.\n\nStarting with (6,7)=F. Let's check (6,6)=1. (6,6)=1 is adjacent to (6,7)=F, which is one bomb. That's correct. Also, (7,6)=1 is adjacent to (6,6)=1, (7,5)=1, etc. Wait, (7,6)=1 is adjacent to (6,6)=1, which is a number, so (7,6)=1 must have one bomb adjacent. The adjacent tiles are (6,5), (6,6)=1, (6,7)=F, (7,5)=1, (7,7)=2, (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). So (7,6)=1 has one bomb at (6,7)=F, which is correct.\n\nNow, (6,8)=F is adjacent to (7,7)=2, which we've already considered. (6,9)=F is adjacent to (5,8)=2, which is the problematic one.\n\nSo, (5,8)=2 is adjacent to (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). All three are F's, but (5,8)=2 can only have two bombs. So one of these must not be a bomb. Let's see if any of these F's can be removed without causing conflicts elsewhere.\n\nIf (6,7) is not a bomb, then (6,6)=1 would still have its bomb accounted for by (6,7)=F, but if (6,7) is not a bomb, then (6,6)=1 would need another bomb adjacent. Let's see: (6,6)=1's adjacent tiles are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). If (6,7) is not a bomb, then (6,6)=1 must have another bomb adjacent. Are there any other F's or numbers that could indicate that?\n\nAlternatively, if (6,9) is not a bomb, then (5,8)=2 would have two bombs: (6,7) and (6,8), which is correct. But then, what about the other numbers around (6,9)=F?\n\nLooking at (5,9): it's _, so not revealed. (7,9) is _. So if (6,9) is not a bomb, then (5,8)=2 is okay. But (6,9)=F would be a flag on a safe tile, which is not allowed because that would be a wrong flag, and the game would end if I reveal it. But since I can't place new flags, maybe I can remove a flag if it's incorrectly placed.\n\nWait, but I can only remove a flag by making a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So if I think (6,9) is incorrectly flagged, I can remove it by making a move with flag=true there, but that would require using a flag, but the flags remaining are 0. So perhaps that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (6,7) is incorrectly flagged. If I remove (6,7)=F, then (5,8)=2 would have (6,8) and (6,9) as bombs, which is two, satisfying the 2. Also, (6,6)=1 would lose its adjacent bomb, so (6,6)=1 would need another bomb adjacent. Let's see: (6,6)=1's adjacent tiles are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7)=F (if we remove it), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). If (6,7) is not a bomb, then (6,6)=1 needs another bomb. Is there another F adjacent to (6,6)? (5,7) is _, (7,7)=2. So unless (5,7) is a bomb, but it's not flagged. So if (6,7) is not a bomb, (6,6)=1 would have no adjacent bombs, which contradicts the 1. Therefore, (6,7) must be a bomb, so (6,6)=1 is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only option is that (6,9) is not a bomb. So (6,9) is incorrectly flagged. Therefore, I should remove the flag at (6,9). But since flags remaining are 0, I can't place a new flag, but I can remove an existing one by making a move with flag=true there.\n\nSo, my next move would be to remove the flag at (6,9). That would leave (5,8)=2 with two bombs: (6,7) and (6,8), which satisfies its condition. Also, (6,9) would become unflagged, and if it's a safe tile, I can then reveal it later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (6,8) is the incorrect flag. Let me check. If (6,8) is not a bomb, then (5,8)=2 would have (6,7) and (6,9) as bombs, which is two, satisfying it. Also, (6,8) being unflagged would affect other numbers. For example, (7,7)=2 is adjacent to (6,7), (6,8), and (6,9). If (6,8) is not a bomb, then (7,7)=2 would have two bombs: (6,7) and (6,9). That's okay. So both (6,8) and (6,9) could be candidates for removal.\n\nBut which one is more likely? Let me check other numbers. For example, (6,9)=F is adjacent to (5,8)=2 and (7,9). (7,9) is _, so not revealed. If (6,9) is a bomb, then (5,8)=2 is okay, but (5,8)=2 would have three bombs, which is a conflict. Therefore, (6,9) must not be a bomb, so the flag there is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I should remove the flag at (6,9). So my next move would be to make a move at (6,9) with flag=true, which would remove the flag there.\n\nBut wait, the rules say that to remove a flag, I have to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So, the move would be (6,9), flag=true. But since the flag is already there, this would remove it. However, the game might interpret it as trying to place a flag, but since flags remaining are 0, it might not allow it. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to reveal the tile, but that would risk hitting a bomb if it's actually a bomb. But since I think it's incorrectly flagged, I have to remove it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal a tile that would give me more information. Let me look for other obvious moves.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 1 is 1. Its adjacent tiles are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,1)=1, (9,1)=1. So (9,1)=1 has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent tiles are (8,0), (8,1)=1, (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). (8,1)=1 is a number, so it's not a bomb. So the bomb must be in one of the other tiles. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 2 is 2. Its adjacent tiles include (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1)=1, (7,3)=2, (8,1)=1, (8,2), (8,3). (7,2)=2 needs two bombs. Let's see if any F's are adjacent. (6,0)=F is adjacent to (7,1)=1, but not directly to (7,2). So (7,2)=2 needs two bombs, but I don't see any F's adjacent, so those bombs must be unflagged. Not sure.\n\nLooking back at row 6, I think the most critical issue is the conflict at (5,8)=2, which is adjacent to three F's. So I need to resolve that. Therefore, the best move is to remove one of the flags causing the conflict. Since (6,9) is the only one that, when removed, doesn't affect other numbers, I think (6,9) is the one to remove.\n\nSo, the move would be (6,9), flag=true to remove the flag. But since the flags remaining are 0, I can't place a new flag, but removing is allowed as it's just toggling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal a tile that would confirm whether (6,9) is a bomb or not. For example, revealing (6,9) would either show a bomb or a number. But since I can't risk revealing a bomb, maybe it's safer to remove the flag.\n\nWait, but if I reveal (6,9) and it's a bomb, the game ends. So that's risky. Alternatively, if I remove the flag, and it's not a bomb, then I can safely reveal it later.\n\nBut since I can't place new flags, I have to be careful. So, perhaps the correct move is to remove the flag at (6,9).\n\nTherefore, my next move is to go to (6,9) and remove the flag, i.e., set flag=true there, which would toggle the flag off.\n</think>\n\nTo address the conflict where (5,8)=2 is adjacent to three flags, the flag at (6,9) must be incorrect. Removing it resolves the conflict without affecting other numbers.\n\nEXPLANATION: Removing the flag at (6,9) resolves the conflict with (5,8)=2, which can only have two adjacent bombs.\nMOVE: 6,9,true", "flags_remaining": 0, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n3 1 2 F 2 1 F _ _ 1 F\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 7, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the information given.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has one flag remaining. My goal is to decide whether to place a flag or reveal a tile next. I need to make sure that whatever move I make doesn't conflict with the rules, especially the critical flag placement rules.\n\nLooking at the board state, I see that some squares are already revealed with numbers, some are flagged (F), some are still unexplored (. ), and some are empty (_). I should start by checking the revealed numbers against the existing flags to see if there are any conflicts.\n\nLet me go row by row to analyze the numbers and their adjacent flags.\n\nStarting with row 0: The revealed squares are at (0,8)=1 and (0,9)=2F. Wait, (0,9) is a flag, so maybe that's a potential bomb. The square at (0,8) is a 1, meaning it has exactly one adjacent bomb. Since (0,9) is flagged, perhaps that's the one bomb adjacent to (0,8). But I should check the surrounding squares of (0,8). The squares around (0,8) are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). (0,7) is _, (1,7) is _, (1,8) is F, and (1,9) is . So, (0,8) is a 1, and it's adjacent to (1,8) which is a flag. That would satisfy the 1, as the flag is the one bomb. So that seems okay.\n\nMoving to row 1: The squares are (1,0)=1, (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=_, (1,8)=F, (1,9)=2. Let's check each number.\n\n(1,0)=1: It's on the edge, so its adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1). (0,0) is _, (0,1) is _, (1,1)=1. Since (1,0) is 1, it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. But none of its adjacent squares are flags, so the bomb must be somewhere around it. Maybe (0,0) is a bomb, but that's unexplored. Not sure yet.\n\n(1,1)=1: Adjacent squares include (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Again, no flags nearby, so the bomb is somewhere in those. But nothing to conflict here.\n\n(1,2)=1: Similar to above, no flags nearby, so no conflict.\n\n(1,3)=2: This is a 2, meaning two bombs adjacent. Let's check the surrounding squares. (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (2,3) is F, so that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb adjacent. So the other bomb could be in (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4). But I don't see any other flags here, so that's okay.\n\n(1,4)=1: Adjacent squares include (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (2,3) is F, so that's the one bomb, which fits the 1.\n\n(1,5)=1: Adjacent squares include (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). (2,5) is 1, but that's a number, not a flag. Wait, no flags here. So the bomb must be somewhere else. Maybe (0,5) is a bomb, but it's unexplored. No conflict yet.\n\n(1,9)=2: This is a 2 at the end of the row. Adjacent squares are (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9). (0,8)=1, (0,9)=F, (1,8)=F, (2,8)=1, (2,9)=2. So (1,9) is a 2, and it's adjacent to (0,9)=F and (1,8)=F, which are two flags. But wait, that would mean (1,9) is adjacent to two bombs, which would make it a 2, but the problem is that the player has only one flag remaining. Wait, no, the flags are already placed. So (0,9) and (1,8) are both flags. So (1,9) is a 2, and it's adjacent to two flags, which would mean two bombs. But the player has only placed two flags so far? Wait, let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board, I see F's at (0,9), (1,8), (2,0), (3,2), (6,0), (6,7), (6,8). So that's seven flags, but the game info says flags remaining: 1. So total flags placed are 10-1=9? Wait, no, the total bombs are 10, so the player can place up to 10 flags, but flags remaining is 1, meaning they've placed 9 flags already. Wait, but looking at the board, I count F's at:\n\nRow 0: (0,9)\nRow 1: (1,8)\nRow 2: (2,0)\nRow 3: (3,2)\nRow 6: (6,0), (6,7), (6,8)\nSo that's 1 + 1 +1 +1 +3 = 7 F's. So the player has placed 7 flags, with 3 remaining? Wait, no, the game info says flags remaining: 1. So total flags allowed are 10, so placed 9, remaining 1. But I count 7 F's. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) \u2192 1\nRow 1: (1,8) \u2192 1\nRow 2: (2,0) \u21921\nRow 3: (3,2) \u21921\nRow 6: (6,0), (6,7), (6,8) \u21923\nTotal: 1+1+1+1+3=7. So that's 7 flags placed, so remaining is 3? But game info says flags remaining:1. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, perhaps the game info says flags remaining:1, meaning the player has one left to place, so they've placed 9 already. But I only see 7. Maybe I missed some.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: (0,9) \u21921\nRow1: (1,8) \u21921\nRow2: (2,0) \u21921\nRow3: (3,2) \u21921\nRow6: (6,0), (6,7), (6,8) \u21923\nThat's 7. So maybe the others are in row4,5,7,8,9? Let me check.\n\nRow4: no F's.\nRow5: no F's.\nRow7: no F's.\nRow8: no F's.\nRow9: no F's.\n\nSo only 7 F's. So maybe the game info is wrong, or perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps the flags remaining is 1, meaning the player has placed 9 flags. So maybe I missed two F's.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nRow0: (0,9)=F \u21921\nRow1: (1,8)=F \u21921\nRow2: (2,0)=F \u21921\nRow3: (3,2)=F \u21921\nRow6: (6,0)=F, (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F \u21923\nThat's 7. So perhaps I'm missing two. Let me check each row again.\n\nRow0: only (0,9)\nRow1: only (1,8)\nRow2: only (2,0)\nRow3: only (3,2)\nRow4: none\nRow5: none\nRow6: three\nRow7: none\nRow8: none\nRow9: none\nHmm, maybe the game info is incorrect, or perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps some F's are in other rows. Wait, row2: (2,0)=F, row3: (3,2)=F, row6: three F's. So total is 1+1+1+1+3=7.\n\nWait, perhaps the flags remaining is 1, meaning that the player has placed 9 flags, but I only see 7. So maybe I'm missing two. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at row4: no F's.\nRow5: no F's.\nRow7: no F's.\nRow8: no F's.\nRow9: no F's.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow0: (0,9)=F \u21921\nRow1: (1,8)=F \u21921\nRow2: (2,0)=F \u21921\nRow3: (3,2)=F \u21921\nRow4: none\nRow5: none\nRow6: (6,0)=F, (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F \u21923\nRow7: none\nRow8: none\nRow9: none\n\nSo that's 1+1+1+1+3=7. So maybe the game info is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the flags remaining is 1, so the player has placed 9 flags, but I only see 7. Maybe I'm missing two. Alternatively, perhaps the board was miswritten. Well, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the player has one flag remaining, so they can place one more.\n\nNow, looking for conflicts. Let's check each revealed number against the adjacent flags.\n\nStarting with row0: (0,8)=1, adjacent to (1,8)=F. So that's okay.\n\nRow1: (1,9)=2, adjacent to (1,8)=F and (0,9)=F. So that's two flags, which would mean two bombs. But (1,9) is a 2, which is correct. So no conflict there.\n\nRow2: (2,0)=F, (2,4)=1, (2,8)=1, (2,9)=2.\n\n(2,4)=1: adjacent squares include (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (3,2)=F, which is adjacent to (2,4)? No, (3,2) is at (3,2), and (2,4) is two columns away, so not adjacent. So (2,4)=1 must have one bomb adjacent. The only flag nearby is (3,2), which is two squares away, so not adjacent. So the bomb must be elsewhere, but no flags nearby, so no conflict.\n\n(2,8)=1: adjacent squares include (1,7), (1,8)=F, (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). So (1,8)=F is adjacent, which is the one bomb, so that's okay.\n\n(2,9)=2: adjacent squares include (1,8)=F, (1,9)=2, (2,8)=1, (3,8), (3,9). So (1,8)=F is one bomb, so there must be another bomb adjacent. The other bomb could be in (3,8) or (3,9). But (3,8) is _, (3,9)=F. Wait, (3,9) is F, so that's another flag. So (2,9)=2 is adjacent to two flags, which would mean two bombs, which is correct. So no conflict.\n\nRow3: (3,2)=F, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=F, (3,7)=_, (3,9)=F.\n\n(3,3)=1: adjacent squares include (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2)=F, (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So (3,2)=F is adjacent, which is the one bomb. So that's okay.\n\n(3,5)=F: It's a flag, so it's a potential bomb.\n\n(3,9)=F: Another flag.\n\nRow4: (4,1)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,7)=1, (4,9)=.\n\n(4,1)=1: adjacent squares include (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)=F, (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). So (3,2)=F is adjacent, which is the one bomb. So that's okay.\n\n(4,3)=1: adjacent squares include (3,2)=F, (3,3)=1, (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (3,2)=F is adjacent, which is the one bomb. So that's okay.\n\n(4,7)=1: adjacent squares include (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). No flags nearby, so the bomb must be somewhere else, but no conflict.\n\nRow5: (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,7)=2.\n\n(5,1)=1: adjacent squares include (4,0), (4,1)=1, (4,2), (5,0), (5,2)=1, (6,0)=F, (6,1), (6,2). (6,0)=F is adjacent, which is the one bomb. So that's okay.\n\n(5,2)=1: adjacent squares include (4,1)=1, (4,2), (4,3)=1, (5,1)=1, (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (6,0)=F is not adjacent to (5,2), so no flags nearby. So the bomb must be elsewhere, but no conflict.\n\n(5,5)=1: adjacent squares include (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). No flags nearby, so no conflict.\n\n(5,7)=2: adjacent squares include (4,6), (4,7)=1, (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F. So (5,7)=2 is adjacent to (6,7)=F and (6,8)=F, which are two flags. So that's correct, as it's a 2. So no conflict.\n\nRow6: (6,0)=F, (6,5)=1, (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1.\n\n(6,5)=1: adjacent squares include (5,4), (5,5)=1, (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). No flags nearby, so the bomb must be elsewhere. No conflict.\n\n(6,9)=1: adjacent squares include (5,8), (5,9), (6,8)=F, (7,8), (7,9). So (6,8)=F is adjacent, which is the one bomb. So that's okay.\n\nRow7: (7,1)=1, (7,3)=2, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=1, (7,7)=1.\n\n(7,1)=1: adjacent squares include (6,0)=F, (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0)=F is adjacent, which is the one bomb. So that's okay.\n\n(7,3)=2: adjacent squares include (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4)=1, (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). No flags nearby, so the two bombs must be somewhere else. No conflict.\n\n(7,4)=1: adjacent squares include (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)=1, (7,3)=2, (7,5)=1, (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). No flags nearby, so no conflict.\n\n(7,5)=1: adjacent squares include (6,4), (6,5)=1, (6,6), (7,4)=1, (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). No flags nearby, so no conflict.\n\nRow8: (8,1)=1.\n\n(8,1)=1: adjacent squares include (7,0), (7,1)=1, (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,1)=1 is a number, but no flags nearby. So the bomb must be elsewhere. No conflict.\n\nRow9: (9,1)=1.\n\n(9,1)=1: adjacent squares include (8,0), (8,1)=1, (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,0), (10,1), (10,2). Wait, the board is 10x10, so row9 is the last row. So adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1)=1, (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). No flags nearby, so no conflict.\n\nSo, after checking all the revealed numbers, I don't see any immediate conflicts with the existing flags. Now, considering the remaining flags: the player has one flag left. So I need to decide whether to place a flag or reveal a tile.\n\nI should look for a square where placing a flag would not conflict with any revealed numbers. Alternatively, revealing a tile that is likely safe.\n\nLooking for obvious places to flag, perhaps where a number indicates that a specific square must be a bomb.\n\nFor example, let's look at row1, column9: (1,9)=2, which is adjacent to (0,9)=F and (1,8)=F. So it's a 2, which is correct. So no conflict there.\n\nLooking at row3, column5: (3,5)=F, but is that correct? Let's see. (3,5) is flagged, but is that consistent with the numbers around it?\n\nLooking at (3,5)=F, let's check the adjacent squares. The square above it is (2,5), which is _, and (2,5) is adjacent to (2,4)=1. So (2,4)=1 has a bomb adjacent, which is (3,2)=F. So that's okay.\n\nWait, (3,5) is F, so it's a potential bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. The square (3,5)=F is adjacent to (3,4), (3,6), (2,4)=1, (2,5), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4)=1 is adjacent to (3,5)=F, which is the one bomb. So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, (3,5) is a flag, but let's check if any number around it requires it to be a bomb. For example, (3,4) is _, but (3,4) is adjacent to (3,5)=F. So if (3,4) is a number, it would have to account for that flag. But (3,4) is _, so it's unexplored. Similarly, (4,5) is _.\n\nSo (3,5) is a flag, and it's consistent with the numbers around it.\n\nNow, looking for a square where placing a flag would satisfy a number's requirement.\n\nFor example, let's look at row5, column7: (5,7)=2. It's adjacent to (6,7)=F and (6,8)=F, which are two flags, so that's correct.\n\nLooking at row6, column5: (6,5)=1. It's adjacent to (5,5)=1, (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4)=1, (7,5)=1, (7,6). No flags nearby, so the bomb must be elsewhere.\n\nWait, (6,5)=1 is adjacent to (5,5)=1, which is a number. So (5,5)=1 must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Let's check (5,5)=1. Its adjacent squares include (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5)=1, (6,6). (6,5)=1 is a number, not a flag. So (5,5)=1 must have one bomb adjacent. The only flag nearby is (6,0)=F, but that's far away. So the bomb must be somewhere else, perhaps (4,4), (4,5), etc.\n\nBut I don't see any flags nearby, so no conflict.\n\nLooking for a place to place the last flag. Maybe row3, column9 is F, but let me check.\n\nWait, (3,9)=F. Let's see if that's consistent. (3,9)=F is adjacent to (2,8)=1, (2,9)=2, (3,8), (4,8)=2, (4,9). (2,9)=2 is adjacent to (3,9)=F and (1,8)=F, which is correct. So (3,9)=F is consistent.\n\nNow, looking for a square where a flag must be placed because a number requires it. For example, if a number is 1 and all adjacent squares except one are revealed as safe, then the remaining square must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row0, column8: (0,8)=1. Its adjacent squares are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8)=F, (1,9). (0,7) is _, (1,7) is _, (1,8)=F, (1,9)=2. So (0,8)=1 is satisfied by (1,8)=F. So no action needed.\n\nLooking at row1, column0: (1,0)=1. Its adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1)=1. All are empty or numbers, no flags. So the bomb must be in one of those squares, but no flags nearby, so no conflict.\n\nLooking at row2, column4: (2,4)=1. Its adjacent squares include (1,3)=2, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3), (2,5), (3,3)=1, (3,4), (3,5)=F. So (3,5)=F is adjacent, which is the one bomb. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at row3, column3: (3,3)=1. Its adjacent squares include (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)=1, (3,2)=F, (3,4), (4,2), (4,3)=1, (4,4). (3,2)=F is adjacent, so that's the one bomb. So okay.\n\nLooking at row4, column1: (4,1)=1. Adjacent to (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)=F, (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1. (3,2)=F is adjacent, so that's the one bomb. Okay.\n\nLooking at row5, column1: (5,1)=1. Adjacent to (4,0), (4,1)=1, (4,2), (5,0), (5,2)=1, (6,0)=F, (6,1), (6,2). (6,0)=F is adjacent, so that's the one bomb. Okay.\n\nLooking at row5, column7: (5,7)=2. Adjacent to (6,7)=F and (6,8)=F, which is correct.\n\nLooking at row6, column5: (6,5)=1. No flags nearby, so bomb must be elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row7, column1: (7,1)=1. Adjacent to (6,0)=F, which is the one bomb. Okay.\n\nLooking at row8, column1: (8,1)=1. No flags nearby, so bomb must be elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row9, column1: (9,1)=1. No flags nearby, so bomb must be elsewhere.\n\nNow, considering that there are 10 bombs in total, and I've placed 7 flags, but the game info says flags remaining:1, so I have one left. I need to find a square that must be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking for a square where a number indicates that it must be a bomb because all other adjacent squares are either safe or have flags.\n\nFor example, let's look at row3, column5: (3,5)=F. Is that the only possible bomb for any number? Let's check.\n\nLooking at (3,4): it's adjacent to (3,5)=F, so if (3,4) is a number, it would have to account for that. But (3,4) is _, so no issue.\n\nLooking at row5, column5: (5,5)=1. It's adjacent to (6,5)=1, which is a number. So (5,5)=1 must have one bomb adjacent. The possible squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5)=1, (6,6). (6,5)=1 is a number, so the bomb must be in one of the other squares. But no flags nearby, so no conflict.\n\nLooking at row6, column9: (6,9)=1. It's adjacent to (5,8), (5,9), (6,8)=F, (7,8), (7,9). So (6,8)=F is the one bomb. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at row7, column3: (7,3)=2. It's adjacent to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4)=1, (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). No flags nearby, so the two bombs must be in those squares. But no way to determine yet.\n\nLooking at row7, column7: (7,7)=1. Adjacent to (6,6), (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F, (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8). (6,7)=F and (6,8)=F are adjacent, but (7,7)=1 can't have two flags adjacent because it's a 1. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, (7,7)=1 is adjacent to (6,7)=F and (6,8)=F. That would mean two bombs adjacent, but (7,7)=1 requires only one bomb. That's a conflict. So either one of those flags is incorrect, or (7,7)=1 is wrong.\n\nWait, that's a critical issue. (7,7)=1 is adjacent to two flags: (6,7)=F and (6,8)=F. So that would mean two bombs adjacent, but (7,7) is a 1, which requires exactly one bomb. That's a conflict. So either one of those flags is wrong, or (7,7)=1 is incorrect.\n\nBut since the game is ongoing, the player must have placed those flags, so perhaps one of them is incorrectly placed. Alternatively, perhaps (7,7)=1 is a mistake, but that's unlikely.\n\nSo, this indicates a conflict. Therefore, one of the flags at (6,7) or (6,8) must be incorrect. But since the player has only one flag remaining, perhaps they can remove one of these flags to resolve the conflict.\n\nBut according to the rules, to remove a flag, the player must make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So, perhaps the next move should be to remove one of these flags.\n\nLooking at (6,7)=F and (6,8)=F, which are both adjacent to (7,7)=1. Since (7,7)=1 can only have one bomb adjacent, one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\nSo, the player should remove one of these flags. Let's decide which one.\n\nLooking at the board, (6,7)=F is at row6, column7. Let's see what other numbers are adjacent to it.\n\n(6,7)=F is adjacent to (5,6), (5,7)=2, (5,8), (6,6), (6,8)=F, (7,6), (7,7)=1, (7,8). (5,7)=2 is adjacent to (6,7)=F and (6,8)=F, which is correct because (5,7)=2 needs two bombs adjacent, and both are flags.\n\nSo, (5,7)=2 is satisfied by (6,7)=F and (6,8)=F. Therefore, if we remove (6,7)=F, then (5,7)=2 would only have one flag adjacent, which would require another bomb. But (5,7)=2 is a 2, so it needs two bombs. Therefore, removing (6,7)=F would cause (5,7)=2 to have only one bomb adjacent, which is (6,8)=F, so another bomb must be adjacent. But (5,7)=2 is a number, so it must have exactly two bombs. Therefore, removing (6,7)=F would require that there's another bomb adjacent to (5,7)=2.\n\nLooking at (5,7)=2, the adjacent squares are (4,6), (4,7)=1, (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7)=F, (6,8)=F. (4,7)=1 is a number, so it can't be a bomb because it's a 1. So the other bomb must be in (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), or (4,6), (4,8). But (5,6) is _, (5,8) is _, (6,6) is _, (4,6) is _, (4,8) is _.\n\nSo, if we remove (6,7)=F, then (5,7)=2 would require another bomb in one of those squares. But since (5,7)=2 is a number, it's possible, but we don't have any flags there, so no conflict yet. However, (7,7)=1 would then only have (6,8)=F as a bomb, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we remove (6,8)=F, then (5,7)=2 would only have (6,7)=F as a bomb, which would require another bomb adjacent. The other bomb could be in (5,8) or elsewhere. But (5,8) is _, so that's possible. However, (6,8)=F is also adjacent to (6,9)=1, which would require that (6,9)=1 has exactly one bomb adjacent. (6,9)=1 is adjacent to (5,8), (5,9), (6,8)=F, (7,8), (7,9). So if (6,8)=F is removed, (6,9)=1 would have no bombs adjacent, which would be incorrect. Therefore, (6,8)=F cannot be removed because it's the only bomb adjacent to (6,9)=1.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to remove (6,7)=F. Because removing (6,8)=F would cause (6,9)=1 to have no bombs adjacent, which is incorrect. So, the correct move is to remove (6,7)=F.\n\nThus, the next move should be to remove the flag at (6,7). So, the move would be (6,7) with flag=true, which would remove the flag.\n\nBut wait, according to the rules, to remove a flag, you make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So, the move would be x=6, y=7, flag=true.\n\nBut before doing that, let's check if this would resolve the conflict. By removing (6,7)=F, (7,7)=1 would only have (6,8)=F as adjacent, which is correct. And (5,7)=2 would have only (6,8)=F as a flag, so it needs another bomb adjacent. The other bomb could be in (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (4,6), or (4,8). Since none of these are flags, it's possible, but we don't have any flags there, so no conflict.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be to remove the flag at (6,7).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps placing a flag elsewhere would resolve the issue, but considering the conflict, it's better to remove the incorrect flag.\n\nSo, the explanation would be that removing the flag at (6,7) resolves the conflict with (7,7)=1, which can only have one bomb adjacent. Since (6,7)=F and (6,8)=F both being adjacent to (7,7)=1 would mean two bombs, which is incorrect. Therefore, removing one of them is necessary, and (6,7)=F is the one that can be removed without causing other conflicts.\n\nSo, the move is to remove the flag at (6,7).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The flag at (6,7) is causing a conflict with (7,7)=1, which can only have one adjacent bomb. Removing this flag resolves the conflict.\n\nMOVE: 6,7,true", "flags_remaining": 1, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n3 1 2 F 2 1 F _ _ 1 F\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 1, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the game info. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are two flags remaining, so I can place two more flags if needed. \n\nLooking at the board, I see several revealed numbers and some flagged squares. My goal is to either reveal a safe square or place a flag correctly without conflicting with the numbers shown. \n\nFirst, I should check all the revealed numbers against the existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. For example, if a square shows a '1' and has two adjacent flags, that's a conflict because the number indicates exactly one bomb nearby. \n\nStarting from the top, in row 0, I see a '1' at (0,8) and a '2' at (0,9). The '2' at (0,9) is interesting because it's at the edge, so it can only have three adjacent squares: (0,8), (1,8), and (1,9). Since (0,8) is a '1', it already has one bomb adjacent. Therefore, the '2' must have another bomb adjacent, which would have to be either (1,8) or (1,9). \n\nLooking at row 1, I see a '2' at (1,9). That square is flagged, so maybe that's the second bomb for the '2' at (0,9). Wait, but the '2' at (0,9) is adjacent to (1,9), which is flagged, so that would account for one bomb. Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (0,9). The possible squares are (0,8), which is a '1', so it can't have a bomb, and (1,8), which is a 'F'. Wait, (1,8) is a flag. So does that mean (1,8) is a bomb? Because (0,9) is a '2', and it's adjacent to (1,9) which is a flag, and (1,8) which is another flag. That would make two bombs adjacent to (0,9), which matches the '2'. So that seems okay.\n\nBut wait, (1,8) is a flag, so it's considered a bomb. But let me check the numbers around it. For example, (0,8) is a '1', and if (1,8) is a bomb, then (0,8) is correctly showing '1' because it's adjacent to (1,8). Similarly, (1,7) is a '_', so I don't know what's there yet.\n\nMoving on, in row 3, there's a '1' at (3,0), a '2' at (3,1), and a 'F' at (3,2). The '2' at (3,1) has adjacent squares, including (3,0) which is a '1', so that might indicate a bomb somewhere else. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 6, there's a 'F' at (6,0), and a '2' at (6,7), and another 'F' at (6,8). The '2' at (6,7) is adjacent to (6,8), which is a flag, so that's one bomb. Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (6,7). The possible squares are (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), and (7,7). Let's see:\n\n- (5,6) is a '1', which is a number, so it's safe.\n- (5,7) is a '1' as well.\n- (5,8) is a '2' in row 5, column 8.\n- (6,6) is a '_', so unknown.\n- (7,7) is a '_'.\n\nSo, the '2' at (6,7) needs another bomb. Since (6,8) is already a flag, maybe (5,8) is a bomb? But (5,8) is a '2', so that can't be. Alternatively, maybe (7,7) is a bomb. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 9, there's a '1' at (9,1). This '1' must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), and (9,2). (8,1) is a '1', which is a number, so it's safe. (9,0) is a '_', and (9,2) is a '_', so maybe one of those is a bomb.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for squares that are numbers with only one possible bomb location left. For example, in row 0, column 8 is a '1', which is adjacent to (1,8), which is a flag. So that '1' is accounted for. Similarly, in row 1, column 0 is a '1', so it must have one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0). (0,0) is '_', (0,1) is '_', (1,1) is '1', and (2,0) is 'F'. So the '1' at (1,0) is adjacent to (2,0), which is a flag. So that's one bomb, which is correct.\n\nWait, but (1,0) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (2,0), which is a flag. So that's fine. No conflict there.\n\nAnother area to check is row 2, column 4, which is a '1'. It's adjacent to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5). Among these, (3,2) is a 'F', so that's a bomb. Therefore, the '1' at (2,4) is satisfied by the flag at (3,2). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but (2,4) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (3,2), which is a flag. So that's one bomb, which is correct.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 3 is a 'F', so that's a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. For example, (3,2) is 'F', which is a bomb, but (3,4) is '1', which is a number. So (3,4) is a '1' and it's adjacent to (3,3), which is a bomb. So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at row 4, column 1 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), and (5,2). Among these, (3,2) is a 'F', so that's one bomb, which satisfies the '1' at (4,1). So that's correct.\n\nI think I should look for a square where placing a flag would satisfy a number. For example, in row 6, column 0 is a 'F', which is a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. The square (5,0) is '_', and (6,1) is '_', but (7,0) is '_', and (7,1) is '1'. So the '1' at (7,1) is adjacent to (6,0), which is a flag. So that '1' is accounted for.\n\nWait, but (7,1) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (6,0), which is a flag. So that's one bomb, which is correct.\n\nAnother area to check is row 9, column 1 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), and (9,2). (8,1) is a '1', which is a number, so it's safe. (9,0) and (9,2) are unknown. So perhaps one of them is a bomb.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a number that has only one possible spot for a bomb. For example, row 5, column 7 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), and (6,8). Among these, (6,7) is a '2', which is a number, and (6,8) is a 'F'. So the '1' at (5,7) is adjacent to (6,8), which is a flag. So that's one bomb, which is correct.\n\nWait, but (5,7) is a '1', so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. It's adjacent to (6,8), which is a flag. So that's correct. So no conflict there.\n\nAnother square is row 5, column 8 is a '2'. It's adjacent to (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), and (6,9). Among these, (6,8) is a 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (5,8). The possible squares are (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (6,7), or (6,9). \n\nLooking at (4,8), it's a '2' in row 4, column 8. Wait, no, row 4, column 8 is '_', and row 5, column 8 is '2'. So (5,8) is '2', and it's adjacent to (6,8), which is a 'F'. So the other bomb must be somewhere else. Maybe (4,8) is a bomb? But (4,8) is adjacent to (4,7), which is a '1', and (4,9) is a '.'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,7) is a '1', which is already accounted for by (6,8). So I'm not sure.\n\nI think I should look for a square where placing a flag would satisfy a number without causing conflicts. For example, in row 1, column 9 is a '2' and it's flagged. Wait, no, (1,9) is a '2' and it's adjacent to (0,8), which is a '1', and (0,9), which is a '2'. Also, (1,8) is a 'F'. So the '2' at (1,9) is adjacent to (1,8), which is a flag, and perhaps another bomb. Wait, but (1,9) is a '2', so it needs two bombs adjacent. It's adjacent to (1,8) and (0,9). Wait, (0,9) is a '2', not a bomb. So that can't be. So the '2' at (1,9) must have two bombs adjacent. It's adjacent to (1,8) and perhaps (2,9). Because (2,9) is a '2' as well. Wait, no, (2,9) is a '2' in row 2, column 9. So (1,9) is a '2', and it's adjacent to (1,8) which is a flag, and (2,9) which is a '2'. So that would mean that (1,9) needs another bomb adjacent. So maybe (0,9) is a bomb? But (0,9) is a '2', so it's a number, not a bomb. So that can't be. Therefore, (1,9) must have another bomb adjacent. The only other square is (2,8) or (2,9). But (2,9) is a '2', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Therefore, maybe (2,8) is a bomb. But (2,8) is a '1' in row 2, column 8. Wait, no, row 2, column 8 is a '1', which is a number. So that can't be a bomb. Therefore, I'm confused here. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, (1,9) is a '2', which means it has two bombs adjacent. It's adjacent to (1,8) which is a flag, so that's one bomb. Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent. The possible squares are (0,8), (0,9), (2,8), or (2,9). \n\n- (0,8) is a '1', which is a number, so it's safe.\n- (0,9) is a '2', which is a number, so it's safe.\n- (2,8) is a '1', which is a number, so it's safe.\n- (2,9) is a '2', which is a number, so it's safe.\n\nWait, that can't be. So (1,9) is a '2' but it's only adjacent to one bomb at (1,8). That's a problem because it should have two bombs. So either there's a mistake in the board, or I'm misunderstanding. Maybe (1,9) is incorrectly flagged? Or perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, (1,9) is a '2' and it's adjacent to (1,8) which is a flag. So that's one bomb. It's also adjacent to (0,9), which is a '2', but that's a number, so it's safe. It's adjacent to (2,9), which is a '2', also a number. So that can't be. Therefore, (1,9) must have another bomb adjacent, but all other adjacent squares are numbers. So that suggests that there's a conflict, meaning that perhaps (1,9) shouldn't be a '2' or (1,8) shouldn't be a flag. But since I can't change the board, maybe I should consider that (1,9) is a '2' and already has one flag, so I need to find another bomb adjacent to it. But all other adjacent squares are numbers, so that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps (1,9) is incorrectly flagged, and I should remove the flag there. But I only have two flags remaining, so I might need to use one to remove a flag, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for other squares where placing a flag would satisfy a number. For example, in row 3, column 5 is a 'F', which is a bomb. Let's see the numbers around it. (3,4) is a '1', which is adjacent to (3,5), so that's correct. (2,4) is a '1', which is also adjacent to (3,5), so that's correct. \n\nAnother area is row 6, column 0 is a 'F', which is a bomb. The square (7,1) is a '1', which is adjacent to (6,0), so that's correct. \n\nI think I should focus on a square where placing a flag would satisfy a number without causing conflicts. Let me look at row 7, column 7 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), and (8,8). Among these, (6,7) is a '2', (6,8) is a 'F', and (7,6) is a '1'. So the '1' at (7,7) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. It's adjacent to (6,8), which is a flag, so that's one bomb. Therefore, that's correct.\n\nWait, but (7,7) is a '1', so it's adjacent to (6,8), which is a flag. So that's correct.\n\nAnother square is row 8, column 1 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), and (9,2). Among these, (7,1) is a '1', which is a number, and (9,1) is a '1'. So the '1' at (8,1) must have one bomb adjacent. It's adjacent to (9,1), which is a '1', so that's a number. Therefore, the bomb must be elsewhere. Maybe (7,0) or (8,0) or (9,0) or (9,2). \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a square that is a number with only one possible bomb location. For example, row 5, column 5 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), and (6,6). Among these, (6,5) is a '1', which is a number, and (4,5) is a '1'. So the '1' at (5,5) must have one bomb adjacent. It's adjacent to (4,5), which is a '1', so that's a number. Therefore, the bomb must be elsewhere, perhaps (6,5) is a bomb? But (6,5) is a '1', which is a number. So that can't be. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. I have two flags left. I need to decide whether to place a flag or reveal a square. Revealing a square could help me get more information, but it's risky if it's a bomb. Placing a flag could help satisfy a number, but I have to make sure it doesn't conflict.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 1 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), and (9,2). Among these, (8,1) is a '1', which is a number. So the bomb must be in (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), or (9,2). \n\nIf I could find a square where placing a flag would satisfy a '1', that would be good. For example, if (9,0) is a bomb, then (9,1) would be satisfied. But I don't know if (9,0) is a bomb. Alternatively, maybe (9,2) is a bomb. \n\nBut I don't have enough information. Maybe I should look for a square that is a '1' and has only one possible bomb location. For example, row 7, column 7 is a '1', and it's adjacent to (6,8), which is a flag. So that's one bomb. Therefore, it's satisfied. \n\nWait, maybe I should look for a square that is a '2' and has only one flag adjacent, so I can place another flag. For example, row 0, column 9 is a '2', and it's adjacent to (0,8) which is a '1' and (1,9) which is a '2'. Wait, no, (0,9) is adjacent to (1,9), which is a '2', not a flag. So (0,9) is a '2' and it's adjacent to (0,8) which is a '1' and (1,8) which is a 'F'. So that's one flag. Therefore, it needs another bomb adjacent. The possible squares are (1,9), but (1,9) is a '2', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Therefore, I'm confused again.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that (0,9) is a '2' and it's adjacent to (1,8) which is a flag. So that's one bomb. Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent. The possible squares are (1,9), but that's a '2', which can't be a bomb. So perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe (0,9) is a '2' and it's adjacent to (1,8) and (1,9). But (1,9) is a '2', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Therefore, I'm stuck.\n\nMaybe I should consider placing a flag somewhere else. Let's look at row 6, column 6 is a '1'. It's adjacent to (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), and (7,7). Among these, (6,7) is a '2', (5,7) is a '1', and (7,7) is a '1'. So the '1' at (6,6) must have one bomb adjacent. It's adjacent to (6,7), which is a '2', so that's a number. Therefore, the bomb must be elsewhere. Maybe (5,5) is a bomb? But (5,5) is a '1', which is a number. So that can't be. Alternatively, (7,5) is a '1', which is a number. So I'm not sure.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should try to reveal a square that's likely to be safe. For example, row 0, column 0 is '_', but it's in the corner, so it's only adjacent to (0,1) and (1,0), which are both '1's. Since both (0,1) and (1,0) are '1's, they each have one bomb adjacent. But I don't know where. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal row 5, column 0, which is '_', but it's adjacent to (4,0), which is '_', and (5,1), which is '1', and (6,0), which is 'F'. So (5,0) is adjacent to (6,0), which is a flag. So if I reveal (5,0), it might be safe, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, (5,1) is a '1', which is adjacent to (5,0), (5,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (6,0), (6,1), and (6,2). Among these, (6,0) is a 'F', so that's one bomb. Therefore, (5,1) is satisfied. So (5,0) could be safe because (5,1) is a '1' and it's adjacent to (6,0). Therefore, revealing (5,0) might be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that is a '2' and has only one flag adjacent, so I can place another flag. For example, row 6, column 7 is a '2', and it's adjacent to (6,8), which is a flag. So it needs another bomb. The possible squares are (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), or (7,7). \n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (5,6) is a '1', which is a number.\n- (5,7) is a '1', which is a number.\n- (5,8) is a '2', which is a number.\n- (6,6) is a '1', which is a number.\n- (7,7) is a '1', which is a number.\n\nSo none of these can be bombs because they're all numbers. Therefore, (6,7) must have another bomb adjacent, but all possible squares are numbers. So that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps (6,7) is incorrectly a '2', but that can't be changed. So maybe I should consider that (6,7) is a '2' and already has one flag, so I need to find another bomb, but I can't. Therefore, perhaps I should remove a flag elsewhere to free up a flag to place here.\n\nBut I only have two flags remaining, and I can't remove a flag without using a move. So maybe I should remove a flag that's causing a conflict. For example, in row 1, column 9 is a '2', but it's adjacent to (1,8) which is a flag, and (0,9) which is a '2'. So (1,9) is a '2' and needs two bombs, but it's only adjacent to one. Therefore, perhaps (1,9) shouldn't be a '2', but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe (1,8) shouldn't be a flag, but I can't change that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount. (1,9) is a '2', and it's adjacent to (1,8) which is a flag, and (0,9) which is a '2'. So (1,9) needs another bomb. The only other square is (2,9), which is a '2', but that's a number. So that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps (1,9) is incorrectly flagged, and I should remove the flag there. But that would require a move, and I can only do that if I have a flag to place elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that (1,9) is a '2' and it's adjacent to (1,8) and (2,9). But (2,9) is a '2', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Therefore, I'm stuck again.\n\nI think I need to make a move that will give me more information. Maybe I should reveal a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, so that I can get more clues. For example, row 5, column 5 is a '1', and it's adjacent to several numbers. If I reveal (5,5), I might find out if it's a bomb or not, but it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal row 9, column 9, which is a '.', but it's in the corner, so it's only adjacent to (8,8) and (9,8). (9,8) is a '.', and (8,8) is a '.'. So it's less risky, but not very informative.\n\nWait, row 9, column 9 is a '.', so if I reveal it, it might show a number or a bomb. If it's a number, that could help. If it's a bomb, I lose. But since it's a corner, the chance of it being a bomb is lower, but not guaranteed.\n\nAlternatively, I could reveal row 0, column 1, which is a '_', and it's adjacent to (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), and (1,1). (0,0) is '_', (0,2) is '_', (1,0) is '1', and (1,1) is '1'. So revealing (0,1) might show a number or a bomb. If it's a number, I can get more info. If it's a bomb, I lose. But it's a bit risky.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing row 0, column 1. Let's see:\n\nIf I reveal (0,1), and it's a '1', that means there's one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), and (1,1). (1,0) is a '1', so it's already accounted for. So if (0,1) is a '1', then the bomb must be in (0,2) or (1,1). But (1,1) is a '1', so it's a number, so the bomb must be in (0,2). \n\nBut I don't know yet. Alternatively, if (0,1) is a '2', that would mean two bombs are adjacent, but that's less likely since (1,0) is a '1'. \n\nI think it's worth the risk to reveal (0,1) to get more information. So my next move would be to reveal (0,1).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (0,1) to gain more information about adjacent bombs, which could help satisfy the numbers in the surrounding squares.\nMOVE: 0,1,false", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n3 1 2 F 2 1 F _ _ 1 F\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 F 1\n7 _ 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _ _\n8 _ 1 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n9 _ 1 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 7, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board state and the game info provided. \n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, which is pretty standard. There are 10 bombs in total, and I have 2 flags remaining. So I need to be careful with where I place those flags because I can't afford to waste them.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares are already revealed, some are flagged (marked with F), and others are still unexplored (marked with .). My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. Since I have flags left, I might consider placing them where I'm pretty sure there's a bomb, but I have to make sure I don't conflict with the numbers shown on the revealed squares.\n\nLet me go through the board row by row to see where I can find clues.\n\nStarting with row 0: It has a lot of unexplored squares, except for the last two, which are 1 and 2. So position (0,8) is 1 and (0,9) is 2. That means around (0,8), there's exactly one bomb in the adjacent squares, and around (0,9), there are two bombs adjacent. But since these are at the edge, their adjacent squares are limited.\n\nRow 1: The first three squares are 1, then a 2, followed by more 1s, an unexplored, and ends with F and a 2. So, for example, position (1,0) is 1, which means one bomb around it. But I see that (0,0) is unexplored, (0,1) is unexplored, (1,1) is 1, etc. Maybe I can cross-reference these.\n\nRow 2 has a flag at (2,0), then some unexplored, a 1, and so on. Position (2,4) is 1, which could help narrow down where the bombs are.\n\nRow 3 is interesting. It starts with 1, then 2, F, 2, 1, F, etc. So (3,2) is a flag, which I should consider. If I look at the numbers around it, maybe I can see if that flag is correctly placed or if it's causing a conflict.\n\nRow 4 has some unexplored and a few numbers. Position (4,1) is 1, which might be useful.\n\nRow 5 is mostly unexplored except for some 1s and 2s.\n\nRow 6 has a flag at (6,0), and some other numbers. Position (6,8) is 2, which is a number I can use.\n\nRow 7 has some 1s and 2s, and row 8 and 9 are mostly unexplored except for a few 1s.\n\nNow, let me think about the critical flag placement rules. Each number must have exactly as many bombs adjacent as the number indicates. So if a square is a 1, there must be exactly one bomb around it, no more, no less. If I place a flag somewhere, I have to make sure that it doesn't cause any of the revealed numbers to have too many or too few bombs adjacent.\n\nLooking at row 0, position (0,8) is 1. The adjacent squares would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). But (1,9) is a 2, so maybe that's a clue. Wait, no, (1,9) is a 2, so it's a number, not a flag. So around (0,8), there's one bomb. Let me check the surrounding squares. (0,7) is unexplored, (1,7) is unexplored, (1,8) is F, and (1,9) is 2. So the flag at (1,8) is one bomb, which satisfies the 1 at (0,8). That seems okay.\n\nNow, looking at row 1, position (1,9) is 2. So around this square, there must be two bombs. The adjacent squares would be (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), and (2,9). (0,8) is 1, (0,9) is 2, (1,8) is F, and (2,9) is 2. So the flag at (1,8) is one bomb, but the square at (1,9) is 2, so there must be another bomb adjacent. Let's see: (0,9) is 2, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (2,9) is 2, also a number. So the only other square is (2,8), which is 1. Wait, (2,8) is 1, so that square has one bomb around it. But (2,8) is adjacent to (1,8), which is a flag, so that accounts for one bomb. So does (2,8) need another bomb? Or is that the only one? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try to find a square where placing a flag would satisfy the numbers around it without causing conflicts. For example, if I look at row 3, position (3,2) is a flag. Let's check the numbers around it. The adjacent squares would include (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Now, (3,1) is 2, so around (3,1), there should be two bombs. Let's see: (2,0) is F, (2,1) is unexplored, (2,2) is unexplored, (3,0) is 1, (3,2) is F, (4,0) is unexplored, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is unexplored. So around (3,1), there's a flag at (2,0) and (3,2). That's two flags, but each flag represents a bomb. So if (3,1) is 2, that means there should be two bombs adjacent. So the flags at (2,0) and (3,2) would account for those two bombs. That seems okay.\n\nWait, but (3,1) is 2, and it's adjacent to two flags, so that's correct. So that flag at (3,2) is correctly placed because it satisfies the 2 at (3,1).\n\nNow, looking at row 6, position (6,0) is a flag. Let's check the numbers around it. The adjacent squares would be (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), and (7,0). (5,0) is unexplored, (5,1) is 1, (6,1) is unexplored, and (7,0) is unexplored. So the flag at (6,0) is a bomb. Now, looking at (5,1), which is 1. So around (5,1), there should be exactly one bomb. The adjacent squares include (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). Among these, (6,0) is a flag, which is a bomb, so that accounts for the one bomb. So that's correct.\n\nNow, I have two flags left. I need to decide where to place them. Let me look for squares where the numbers indicate that a flag must be placed there, or where placing a flag would satisfy multiple numbers.\n\nLooking at row 2, position (2,0) is a flag. Let's see if that's causing any issues. The adjacent squares are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). (1,0) is 1, (1,1) is 1, (3,0) is 1. So the flag at (2,0) is a bomb. Now, (1,0) is 1, so it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (1,0) are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). Among these, (2,0) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking for other potential spots. Let's look at row 3, position (3,5) is F. Let's check the numbers around it. The adjacent squares would be (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (3,4) is 1, so around (3,4), there should be exactly one bomb. The flag at (3,5) is one bomb, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but (3,4) is 1, and it's adjacent to (3,5), which is a flag. So that's one bomb, which satisfies the 1. So that's good.\n\nNow, looking at row 6, position (6,8) is 2. So around (6,8), there must be two bombs. The adjacent squares are (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). Among these, (6,9) is F, which is a bomb, and (7,7) is 1, which is a number, not a bomb. So that's one bomb so far. So there must be another bomb adjacent to (6,8). Let's see: (5,8) is 2, which is a number, (5,7) is unexplored, (6,7) is unexplored, (7,8) is unexplored, (7,9) is unexplored. So maybe there's another bomb in one of those squares.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 7, position (7,8) is unexplored, and (7,9) is unexplored. If I could figure out where the bombs are around (6,8), that might help.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 0, position (0,9) is 2. So around (0,9), there must be two bombs. The adjacent squares are (0,8), (1,8), (1,9). (0,8) is 1, (1,8) is F, and (1,9) is 2. So the flag at (1,8) is one bomb, so there must be another bomb adjacent to (0,9). The only other square is (1,9), which is 2, so it's not a bomb. Wait, that can't be right. So (0,9) is 2, and it's adjacent to (1,8) which is a flag (one bomb), and (1,9) is 2, which is a number, not a bomb. So where is the second bomb? Maybe (0,7) is a bomb? Because (0,8) is 1, and (0,7) is adjacent to (0,8). Let me check.\n\nIf (0,7) is a bomb, then (0,8) being 1 would be correct because it's adjacent to (0,7). But (0,9) is 2, which is adjacent to (1,8) as one bomb and needs another. So if (0,7) is a bomb, that would make (0,8) have one bomb, which is correct, and (0,9) would have two bombs: (1,8) and (0,7). But wait, (0,9) is only adjacent to (0,8), (1,8), and (1,9). So if (0,7) is a bomb, it's not adjacent to (0,9). Therefore, (0,9) must have another bomb adjacent. The only other square is (1,9), which is a 2, so it can't be a bomb. So this is a problem. It seems like (0,9) is 2, but only one bomb is adjacent (at (1,8)), which would mean there's a conflict. Therefore, perhaps the flag at (1,8) is incorrectly placed, or there's another bomb somewhere else.\n\nWait, but I can't remove a flag unless I make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So maybe I should consider removing the flag at (1,8) because it's causing a conflict. Let me think: if I remove the flag at (1,8), then (0,8) is 1, which would require one bomb adjacent. So the bomb could be at (1,8) or somewhere else. But (0,9) is 2, which would then need two bombs adjacent. If (1,8) is not a flag, then perhaps the bombs are at (0,7) and (1,9). But (1,9) is 2, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (1,7) is a bomb. Let me check. If (1,7) is a bomb, then (0,8) is 1, which would be satisfied by (1,7). Then (0,9) is 2, which would have bombs at (1,8) and (1,7). But (1,8) is a flag, so that would make two bombs, satisfying (0,9). But wait, (1,7) is adjacent to (0,8), which is 1, so that would make sense. But (1,7) is currently unexplored, so maybe that's a possibility.\n\nBut I can't reveal (1,7) because I don't know if it's a bomb. So perhaps I should consider removing the flag at (1,8) because it's causing a conflict. Let me see: if I remove the flag at (1,8), then (0,8) is 1, which would need one bomb adjacent. If (1,8) is not a bomb, then the bomb must be somewhere else around (0,8), like (0,7) or (1,7). Similarly, (0,9) is 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent, which could be (1,8) and (1,7), but if I remove the flag at (1,8), then (1,7) would need to be a bomb, but (1,7) is adjacent to (1,6), which is unexplored, and (1,8) would then be unflagged, which might cause other issues.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for other areas where the flags are correctly placed without causing conflicts.\n\nLooking at row 3, position (3,5) is a flag. Let's check the numbers around it. (3,4) is 1, so that's one bomb. The flag at (3,5) is one bomb, so that's correct. (3,6) is unexplored, so if there's another bomb, it would be there, but (3,6) is adjacent to (3,5), which is a flag, so that would make (3,6) have one bomb adjacent, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, (3,6) is adjacent to (3,5), which is a flag, so if (3,6) is a number, it should reflect that. But (3,6) is unexplored, so I don't know yet.\n\nLet me try to find a square where placing a flag would satisfy multiple numbers. For example, if I place a flag at (1,7), would that help both (0,8) and (0,9)?\n\nIf I place a flag at (1,7), then (0,8) is 1, which would be satisfied because it's adjacent to (1,7). Then (0,9) is 2, which would need another bomb. The other bomb could be at (1,8), but that's currently a flag. So if I place a flag at (1,7), I would have to remove the flag at (1,8) to avoid having two flags, but I only have two flags left, so I can't do that. Alternatively, maybe (1,7) is a bomb, and (1,8) is not. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for squares where the numbers are 1, and see if they have only one possible spot for a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 4, position (4,1) is 1. The adjacent squares are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Among these, (3,2) is a flag, which is one bomb. So that satisfies the 1 at (4,1). So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at row 5, position (5,1) is 1. The adjacent squares include (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). Among these, (6,0) is a flag, which is one bomb, so that satisfies the 1 at (5,1). Correct.\n\nLooking at row 7, position (7,1) is 2. The adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). Among these, (6,0) is a flag, which is one bomb. So there must be another bomb adjacent to (7,1). Let's see: (7,2) is 2, (8,1) is 1, etc. So maybe the other bomb is at (7,2) or somewhere else.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for the most obvious place to place a flag. Let's see: row 9, position (9,1) is 1. The adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,0), etc. Wait, the board is only 10x10, so (9,1) is at the bottom. The adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). Among these, (9,0) is unexplored, (9,2) is unexplored. So if (9,1) is 1, there must be exactly one bomb adjacent. Maybe I can place a flag at (9,0) or (9,2) if that satisfies the number.\n\nBut I don't have enough information yet. Alternatively, maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, making it a likely candidate for a flag.\n\nLooking at row 2, position (2,4) is 1. The adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Among these, (3,5) is a flag, which is one bomb, satisfying the 1 at (2,4). So that's correct.\n\nWait, (2,4) is 1, and it's adjacent to (3,5), which is a flag. So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at row 6, position (6,8) is 2. As I thought earlier, it needs two bombs adjacent. One is at (6,9), which is a flag, so there must be another bomb nearby. Let's see: (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). Among these, (5,9) is unexplored, (6,7) is unexplored, (7,7) is 1, (7,8) is unexplored. So maybe the other bomb is at (5,9) or (6,7).\n\nBut I don't have enough info to be sure. Maybe I should consider placing a flag at (5,9) if that makes sense.\n\nWait, (5,9) is adjacent to (5,8), which is 2, so if (5,9) is a bomb, then (5,8) would have one bomb adjacent, but (5,8) is 2, so it needs another bomb. That would require another bomb adjacent to (5,8), which could be at (5,7) or (4,8), etc. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other bomb is at (6,7). If I place a flag at (6,7), then (6,8) would have two bombs: (6,9) and (6,7). That would satisfy the 2 at (6,8). But I need to check if that causes any conflicts elsewhere.\n\nIf I place a flag at (6,7), let's see the adjacent numbers. (6,7) is adjacent to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). Among these, (5,7) is unexplored, (5,8) is 2, (6,8) is 2, (7,7) is 1, (7,8) is unexplored.\n\nSo placing a flag at (6,7) would mean that (5,8) is 2, which would require another bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares to (5,8) are (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). Among these, (6,7) would be a flag, so that's one bomb. So (5,8) needs another bomb, which could be at (5,9) or (4,8), etc.\n\nBut I don't know yet. Maybe placing a flag at (6,7) is a good move because it satisfies (6,8)'s requirement for two bombs. Let me check if that causes any conflicts elsewhere.\n\nLooking at (7,7), which is 1. If (6,7) is a flag, then (7,7) is adjacent to a bomb, which is correct because it's 1. So that works.\n\nSo, placing a flag at (6,7) would satisfy both (6,8) and (7,7). That seems like a good move. Plus, I have two flags left, so I can do that.\n\nBut wait, I only have two flags remaining. So I can place one at (6,7). Let me make sure that this doesn't cause any other conflicts.\n\nIf I place a flag at (6,7), then (6,8) is 2, which is satisfied by (6,9) and (6,7). (7,7) is 1, which is satisfied by (6,7). (5,8) is 2, which would need another bomb, but I don't know where yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag at (5,9). Let me see.\n\nIf I place a flag at (5,9), then (5,8) is 2, which would have one bomb at (5,9) and needs another. The other bomb could be at (5,7) or (4,8), but I don't know.\n\nBut placing a flag at (6,7) seems more straightforward because it satisfies two numbers: (6,8) and (7,7).\n\nSo, I think I'll place a flag at (6,7). That should satisfy the numbers around it without causing conflicts elsewhere. Plus, it uses one of my two remaining flags.\n\nWait, but I have two flags left. So I could place another flag somewhere else, but I need to make sure I don't cause any conflicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square instead of placing a flag. Let me see if there's a square that's safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 0, position (0,0) is unexplored. If I reveal it, I might get a number or a bomb. But since I don't know, it's risky. Maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, making it likely to be safe.\n\nFor example, looking at row 1, position (1,2) is 1. It's adjacent to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Among these, (1,1) is 1, (1,3) is 2. So if I reveal (1,2), I might get a number or a bomb. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a 1, making it more likely to be safe. For example, (9,1) is 1, so the squares around it must have exactly one bomb. If I reveal (9,0), which is adjacent to (9,1), and if it's a number, that could help.\n\nBut I'm not sure. It's a bit risky because if it's a bomb, I lose. So maybe it's better to place a flag where I'm more certain.\n\nGiven all this, I think placing a flag at (6,7) is a good move because it satisfies the numbers around it without causing conflicts. So I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (6,7) satisfies the adjacent numbers at (6,8) and (7,7) without causing conflicts with other revealed numbers.\n\nMOVE: 6,7,true", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 F\n1 1 1 2 1 1 _ _ F . 2\n2 F . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 2\n3 1 2 F 2 1 F _ _ 1 F\n4 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 .\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 . .\n6 F _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 F 1\n7 _ 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _ _\n8 _ 1 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n9 _ 1 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
