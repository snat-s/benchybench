{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Since this is the start of the game with a completely unexplored board, the best strategy is to start with a corner or edge move. Corner moves are particularly good starting points in Minesweeper because they have fewer adjacent tiles (only 3 instead of 8), which reduces the initial risk.\n\nThe top-left corner (0,0) is a classic safe starting point in Minesweeper. While there's still a chance it could be a bomb, it's generally a good strategic choice because:\n1. It has only 3 adjacent squares instead of 8\n2. If it reveals a number, it gives us clear information about a corner situation\n3.
