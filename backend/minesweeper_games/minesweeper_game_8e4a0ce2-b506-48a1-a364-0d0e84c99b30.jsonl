Since we already know the square at (0,2) is flagged, and (1,2) is flagged, the only remaining possible position for the second bomb adjacent to the \"2\" would be at (2,1).\n\nEXPLANATION: The number \"2\" at position (1,1) already has one confirmed adjacent flag, so there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to it.
