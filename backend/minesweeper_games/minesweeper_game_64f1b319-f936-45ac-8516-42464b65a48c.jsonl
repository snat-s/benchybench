The number '2' at (5,5) indicates that it also has to have 2 adjacent bombs. But since (5,4) is flagged, it implies that to satisfy the number '2' at both (5,5) and (5,3) needs to investigate below as well to uncover any additional bombs.\n\nLooking at squares around (6,2), we know that one bomb must be at (7, 2) or one needs to move to confirm.

The number tile at (5, 5) is a '2'. It currently has one flag adjacent to it (at (5, 4)), meaning one more bomb must be adjacent.\n2. The number tile at (6, 6) is a '2'. It has no flags around it, which means both bombs must be placed around it.\n3. The number tile at (4, 1) is a '2' and has one flag next to it at (4, 0). Thus it needs one more bomb.\n4. The number tile at (1, 7) is a '1' and has no flags around it, so there must be a bomb adjacent to it.\n5. The row above (1, 7) has (0, 7), which is empty, thus it can be revealed without concern.\n\nNext Move:\nGiven that (5, 5) needs to be fulfilled by placing a flag at (5, 6) is completely safe, as it maintains consistency with surrounding numbers and leads towards solving the puzzle.\n\nThus, the next move should be:\n\nEXPLANATION: I will place a flag at (5, 6) because the tile at (5, 5) needs one more bomb adjacent to it, which fits the number criteria and doesn't create any conflicts.\nMOVE: 5,6,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1\n2 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n4 1 2 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . 2 F 2 1 _ _ _\n6 . . . . . . 2 1 1 1\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
