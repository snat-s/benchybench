This is consistent.\n   - **(1,7)** shows '2' and has 1 nearby flag; one more bomb is required nearby.\n   - **(1,8)** shows '2' and has 1 nearby flag; similarly, needs one more bomb.\n   - **(1,9)** shows '1' and has no flags nearby; hence there can be one bomb nearby.\n   - **(2,1)** through **(2,8)** show the adjacent count, many of which are satisfied or indicate conflicts with current flagged bombs.\n  \n2. Assess the **(4,1)**, **(4,2)**, and **(4,3)** tiles:\n   - **(4,1)**: shows '2' and has 0 flags, indicating that there should be two bombs around.\n   - **(4,2)**: is flagged currently, so this adds to the count for the above number.\n   - **(4,3)**: shows '3', meaning there are three bombs in the adjacent squares - which can exclude a couple of flagged tiles.\n\n3. Observe that we have 8 flags remaining and the need for placement of flags seem high given multiple tiles with values greater than 1.\n\n### Move Decision:\nGiven that **(5,2)** is flagged, it influences the adjacent numbers. Comparing the available information, it becomes evident that **(5,1)** should not contain any bombs given the numbers around it. Therefore, it is safe to reveal it.\n\n### Next Move:\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal the tile at coordinates (5,1) as it does not conflict with nearby bombs and seems safe to explore given the adjacent numbers.\nMOVE: 5,1,false", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 2 1\n2 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . .\n3 _ 1 . 1 _ _ 1 . . .\n4 _ 2 F 3 2 2 1 . . .\n5 _ 1 F 2 . . 1 . . .\n6 _ 1 1 2 2 3 2 . . .\n7 _ _ 1 . 2 2 . . . .\n8 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n9 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
