Similarly, there must be one more bomb adjacent to it.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Bomb Locations:**\n   - For (1,7), the adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). However, (1,8) is already flagged, so the remaining bomb must be among (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (2,6).\n   - For (2,7), the adjacent unexplored tiles are (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8).
