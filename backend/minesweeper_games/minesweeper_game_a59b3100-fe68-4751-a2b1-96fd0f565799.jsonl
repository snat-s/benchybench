{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board. The board is 10x10, and all the squares are currently unexplored, marked with dots. I have 10 flags remaining, and there are 10 bombs on the board. \n\nSince the board is completely unexplored, I don't have any numbers or revealed squares to work with yet. That means I can't use any of the critical flag placement rules because there's nothing to analyze. So, my first move has to be a guess, right?\n\nIn Minesweeper, the best strategy is to start by revealing a corner. Why a corner? Because if it's a bomb, it ends the game, but if it's a number, it gives me information about the surrounding squares. Plus, corners have fewer adjacent squares, which can make it easier to deduce where the bombs might be.\n\nLooking at the coordinate system, the top-left corner is (0,0). That's a good starting point. If I reveal this square, one of two things will happen: either it's a bomb (which would be bad), or it's a number, which will help me figure out where to place flags next.\n\nI don't have any other information to go on, so I can't make any educated guesses about other squares. All other squares are equally likely to be bombs or safe. So, the safest initial move is to reveal a corner.\n\nI could also consider revealing the center, but that's not as common a strategy because it doesn't give as much immediate information. Starting in a corner gives me a chance to build up information from there.\n\nSo, I think my first move should be to reveal the square at (0,0). Let's see what happens. If it's a number, I'll know how many bombs are around it, which will help me place flags or reveal other squares. If it's a bomb, well, that's the end of the game, but that's just how Minesweeper works sometimes.\n\nI don't see any other way to proceed without making a guess, so I'll go with revealing (0,0).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Starting with a corner is a common strategy to gather initial information without risking too many adjacent squares. Revealing (0,0) is the first step to begin deducing the placement of bombs based on the number revealed.\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
