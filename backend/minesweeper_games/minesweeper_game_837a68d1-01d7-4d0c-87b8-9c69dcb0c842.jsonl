{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board. From the board state provided, it looks like all the squares are unexplored, represented by dots. That means I haven't revealed any squares yet, and there are no flags placed either. \n\nThe game info tells me that the board is 10x10, which is pretty standard for Minesweeper. There are 10 flags remaining, and 10 bombs on the board. So, the goal is to either reveal all the safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs without detonating any.\n\nSince the board is completely unexplored, my first move is going to be a bit of a gamble. I remember that in Minesweeper, the first move is often the most critical because if you hit a bomb, the game ends immediately. But sometimes, the first move can also reveal a number, giving you some information to work with.\n\nI'm thinking about where to make my first move. Usually, people start in the middle of the board to maximize the information they get. But since the board is symmetric, maybe starting near a corner could also be effective. However, I'm not sure if that's better or worse. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider the probability of hitting a bomb. Since there are 10 bombs on a 10x10 board, each square has a 10% chance of being a bomb. So, no matter where I click, the probability is the same. But sometimes, the first click is safe, or if it's a bomb, the game ends. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere, but I don't have any information yet to make an informed flag placement. So, placing a flag without any clues might not be the best idea. \n\nI think the best approach is to reveal a square. Let me pick a square in the middle, maybe (5,5). That's the center of the board, which could potentially reveal a number and give me a good starting point to analyze the surrounding squares. \n\nAlternatively, I could start at (0,0), the top-left corner, but that might not give me as much information as the center. Hmm. I think the center is better because it's surrounded by more squares, so if I reveal a number, it can help me figure out the surrounding bombs more effectively. \n\nSo, I'm going to decide to reveal the square at (5,5). Let's see what happens. If it's a bomb, the game ends, but if it's a number, I can start deducing where the bombs are. \n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the fact that the first move is often safe. I've heard that some Minesweeper implementations ensure that the first move is safe, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. If that's true, then I can safely reveal (5,5) without worrying about detonating a bomb. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere else, but without any information, that's risky. So, I think the best move is to reveal a square, preferably in the middle to get the most information. \n\nSo, my move will be to reveal the square at (5,5). Let's hope it's a number, which will help me figure out the surrounding bombs.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The board is completely unexplored, so the first move is to reveal a square in the middle to maximize information and potentially reveal a number.\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. It's a 10x10 grid, and I need to identify where the bombs might be based on the numbers revealed. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. There are 10 bombs left and 10 flags remaining, so I need to be careful not to place flags unnecessarily.\n\nLooking at the board, I'll start by examining the numbers and their surrounding cells. Numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent in the 8 surrounding squares. So, if a cell has a '1', there's exactly one bomb in the neighboring cells. Similarly, a '2' means two bombs are nearby.\n\nI'll go row by row, starting from the top.\n\nRow 0:\n- Cells 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\nLooking at cell (0,1) which has a '1'. Its adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). Currently, (0,0) is '.', (0,2) is '_', (1,0) is '1', (1,1) is '1', (1,2) is '_'. Hmm, since (0,1) is '1', there should be one bomb in these adjacent cells. But I don't see any flags here yet. Maybe I can deduce where the bomb is.\n\nWait, cell (0,5) is '1'. Let's check its neighbors: (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,4) is '_', (0,6) is '.', (1,4) is '_', (1,5) is '.', (1,6) is '1'. So, the '1' at (0,5) indicates one bomb nearby. But again, no flags yet.\n\nMoving to row 1:\nCell (1,0) is '1', so adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (0,0) is '.', (0,1) is '1', (0,2) is '_', (1,1) is '1', (2,0) is '_', (2,1) is '_', (2,2) is '_'. So, one bomb must be in these cells. But no flags yet.\n\nCell (1,1) is '1', so same as above. It's a bit tricky because these are interconnected.\n\nRow 2:\nCell (2,5) is '1', (2,6) is '1', (2,7) is '1'. Let's look at (2,5). Its neighbors are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). (1,4) is '_', (1,5) is '.', (1,6) is '1', (2,4) is '_', (2,6) is '1', (3,4) is '_', (3,5) is '1', (3,6) is '_'. So, the '1' at (2,5) suggests one bomb nearby. But again, no flags yet.\n\nRow 3:\nCells (3,0) is '1', (3,1) is '2', (3,2) is '3', (3,3) is '2', (3,4) is '1'. Let's look at (3,0) first. Its neighbors are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is '_', (2,1) is '_', (3,1) is '2', (4,0) is '.', (4,1) is '.'. So, (3,0) being '1' means one bomb is in these cells. But since (3,1) is '2', which indicates two bombs around it, perhaps the bomb is somewhere else.\n\nLooking at (3,1) which is '2'. Its neighbors include (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) is '_', (2,1) is '_', (2,2) is '_', (3,0) is '1', (3,2) is '3', (4,0) is '.', (4,1) is '.', (4,2) is '.'. So, two bombs must be in these cells. But I don't see any flags yet.\n\nMoving to (3,2) which is '3'. Its neighbors are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1) is '_', (2,2) is '_', (2,3) is '_', (3,1) is '2', (3,3) is '2', (4,1) is '.', (4,2) is '.', (4,3) is '.'. So, three bombs must be in these areas. Hmm, that's a lot. Maybe the bombs are in the lower part.\n\nLooking at row 4:\nCells (4,4) is '2', (4,5) is '_', (4,6) is '_', etc. So, (4,4) being '2' means two bombs around it. Its neighbors are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3) is '2', (3,4) is '1', (3,5) is '_', (4,3) is '.', (4,5) is '_', (5,3) is '.', (5,4) is '3', (5,5) is '2'. So, two bombs are in these cells. But again, no flags yet.\n\nRow 5:\nCell (5,4) is '3', (5,5) is '2', (5,6) is '2', (5,7) is '1'. Let's focus on (5,4) which is '3'. Its neighbors are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3) is '.', (4,4) is '2', (4,5) is '_', (5,3) is '.', (5,5) is '2', (6,3) is '.', (6,4) is '2', (6,5) is '.'. So, three bombs are in these cells. Maybe the bombs are in (5,5) and (6,4), but that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at (5,5) which is '2'. Its neighbors are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (4,4) is '2', (4,5) is '_', (4,6) is '_', (5,4) is '3', (5,6) is '2', (6,4) is '2', (6,5) is '.', (6,6) is '.'. So, two bombs must be here. Maybe (4,5) and (4,6) are bombs, but I'm not sure.\n\nRow 6:\nCell (6,4) is '2', (6,5) is '.', (6,6) is '1'. Let's check (6,6) which is '1'. Its neighbors are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5) is '2', (5,6) is '2', (5,7) is '1', (6,5) is '.', (6,7) is '1', (7,5) is '2', (7,6) is '2', (7,7) is '1'. So, one bomb must be in these cells. But I don't see any flags yet.\n\nRow 7:\nCells (7,5) is '2', (7,6) is '2', (7,7) is '1'. Let's check (7,7) which is '1'. Its neighbors are (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8). (6,6) is '1', (6,7) is '1', (6,8) is '.', (7,6) is '2', (7,8) is '.', (8,6) is '.', (8,7) is '.', (8,8) is '.'. So, one bomb here. Maybe (6,6) or (6,7) is a bomb.\n\nWait, but (6,6) is '1', so it has one bomb nearby. If (6,7) is '1', it also has one bomb nearby. So, perhaps (7,7) is a bomb? But that's a guess.\n\nLooking back, maybe I should look for areas where numbers are high and flags can be placed confidently.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which might indicate a bomb.\n\nLooking at cell (3,4) which is '1'. Its neighbors are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is '_', (2,4) is '_', (2,5) is '1', (3,3) is '2', (3,5) is '_', (4,3) is '.', (4,4) is '2', (4,5) is '_'. So, one bomb in these cells. Maybe (4,4) is a bomb, but (4,4) is '2', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, perhaps (4,5) is a bomb, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, cell (3,4) is '1', so one bomb in its neighbors. If I can find a cell that is only adjacent to this '1' and other numbers, maybe I can deduce.\n\nAlternatively, looking at cell (5,4) which is '3'. It's a high number, so there are three bombs around it. Its neighbors are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3) is '.', (4,4) is '2', (4,5) is '_', (5,3) is '.', (5,5) is '2', (6,3) is '.', (6,4) is '2', (6,5) is '.'. So, three bombs must be in these cells. Maybe (4,5), (5,5), and (6,4) are bombs. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, (6,4) is '2', so it has two bombs around it. Its neighbors are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). (5,3) is '.', (5,4) is '3', (5,5) is '2', (6,3) is '.', (6,5) is '.', (7,3) is '.', (7,4) is '.', (7,5) is '2'. So, two bombs here. Maybe (5,5) and (7,5) are bombs, but again, I'm not certain.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for cells that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which could indicate a bomb.\n\nLooking at cell (3,2) which is '3'. Its neighbors are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1) is '_', (2,2) is '_', (2,3) is '_', (3,1) is '2', (3,3) is '2', (4,1) is '.', (4,2) is '.', (4,3) is '.'. So, three bombs must be in these cells. Maybe (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) are bombs, but I don't see any flags there yet.\n\nWait, but cell (3,1) is '2', which has neighbors including (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). So, two bombs here. If (3,2) is '3', which needs three bombs, perhaps (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) are bombs. But I don't see any flags yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (4,1) and (4,2) are bombs, but that's just a guess.\n\nThis is getting a bit overwhelming. Maybe I should look for cells that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which could indicate a bomb.\n\nLooking at cell (5,5) which is '2'. Its neighbors are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (4,4) is '2', (4,5) is '_', (4,6) is '_', (5,4) is '3', (5,6) is '2', (6,4) is '2', (6,5) is '.', (6,6) is '1'. So, two bombs here. Maybe (4,5) and (4,6) are bombs, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,6) is a bomb, but (5,6) is '2', so it's a number, not a bomb.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should look for cells that are adjacent to a '1' and have only one possible spot for the bomb.\n\nLooking back at row 0, cell (0,1) is '1'. Its neighbors are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (0,0) is '.', (0,2) is '_', (1,0) is '1', (1,1) is '1', (1,2) is '_'. So, one bomb here. Maybe (1,2) is a bomb, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, cell (1,2) is '_', which is an empty revealed space. So, it can't be a bomb. So, the bomb must be somewhere else in these cells. Maybe (0,2) is a bomb, but (0,2) is '_', which is empty, so it can't be a bomb. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no, '_' means empty revealed space, so it can't be a bomb. So, the bomb must be in (0,0), (1,0), or (1,1). But (1,0) and (1,1) are '1's, which are numbers, so they can't be bombs. So, the only possible bomb is (0,0), but (0,0) is '.', which is unexplored. So, maybe (0,0) is a bomb. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but if (0,0) is a bomb, then cell (0,1) which is '1' would have that bomb as its only adjacent bomb. That makes sense. So, maybe (0,0) is a bomb. Let me check that.\n\nIf (0,0) is a bomb, then cell (0,1) which is '1' would have one bomb, which is (0,0). That fits. Also, cell (1,0) which is '1' would have one bomb, which is (0,0). That also fits. So, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, maybe (0,0) is a bomb. Let me check if that makes sense with other numbers.\n\nLooking at cell (1,0) which is '1', if (0,0) is a bomb, that satisfies the '1'. Similarly, cell (0,1) which is '1' would also be satisfied by (0,0). So, that seems plausible.\n\nSo, perhaps I should flag (0,0) as a bomb. But before I do that, I should check if this affects other numbers.\n\nIf (0,0) is a bomb, then cell (0,1) and (1,0) are satisfied. Let's see if this affects other cells.\n\nLooking at cell (1,1) which is '1'. Its neighbors are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). If (0,0) is a bomb, then cell (1,1)'s count is already satisfied, so no more bombs in its other neighbors. So, (0,1) is '1', which is already satisfied by (0,0). So, that's okay.\n\nBut cell (1,1) is '1', so only one bomb in its neighbors. Since (0,0) is a bomb, that's the only bomb. So, the other neighbors can't have any bombs. So, (0,1) is '1', which is already satisfied, so (0,2) can't be a bomb. Similarly, (1,0) is '1', which is satisfied, so (1,2) can't be a bomb.\n\nWait, but cell (1,2) is '_', which is empty, so it's safe. So, if (0,0) is a bomb, then (1,2) is safe. That might help.\n\nBut I'm not sure if (0,0) is definitely a bomb. Maybe I should look for other clues.\n\nLooking at row 5, cell (5,4) is '3'. It's a high number, so there are three bombs around it. Its neighbors are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3) is '.', (4,4) is '2', (4,5) is '_', (5,3) is '.', (5,5) is '2', (6,3) is '.', (6,4) is '2', (6,5) is '.'. So, three bombs must be here. Maybe (4,5), (5,5), and (6,4) are bombs. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,5) is a bomb, but (5,5) is '2', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Maybe I should look for cells that are adjacent to multiple high numbers.\n\nLooking at cell (5,5) which is '2'. Its neighbors include (4,4) which is '2', (4,5) which is '_', (4,6) which is '_', (5,4) which is '3', (5,6) which is '2', (6,4) which is '2', (6,5) which is '.', (6,6) which is '1'. So, two bombs here. Maybe (4,5) and (4,6) are bombs, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (6,4) is a bomb, but (6,4) is '2', so it's a number, not a bomb.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for cells that are adjacent to multiple '1's.\n\nLooking at cell (0,5) which is '1'. Its neighbors are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,4) is '_', (0,6) is '.', (1,4) is '_', (1,5) is '.', (1,6) is '1'. So, one bomb in these cells. Maybe (1,6) is a bomb, but (1,6) is '1', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, the bomb must be in (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), or (1,5). But (0,6) is '.', (1,5) is '.', so maybe (0,4) or (1,4) is a bomb.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for other clues.\n\nWait, cell (4,4) is '2'. Its neighbors are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3) is '2', (3,4) is '1', (3,5) is '_', (4,3) is '.', (4,5) is '_', (5,3) is '.', (5,4) is '3', (5,5) is '2'. So, two bombs here. Maybe (4,5) and (5,5) are bombs, but (5,5) is '2', so it can't be a bomb. So, maybe (4,5) and (5,4) are bombs. But (5,4) is '3', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look for cells that are adjacent to multiple numbers, making it more likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at cell (3,2) which is '3'. Its neighbors are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1) is '_', (2,2) is '_', (2,3) is '_', (3,1) is '2', (3,3) is '2', (4,1) is '.', (4,2) is '.', (4,3) is '.'. So, three bombs here. Maybe (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) are bombs, but I don't see any flags yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3) are bombs, but that's speculative.\n\nI'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should look for cells that are adjacent to a '1' and have only one possible spot for the bomb.\n\nLooking at cell (6,6) which is '1'. Its neighbors are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5) is '2', (5,6) is '2', (5,7) is '1', (6,5) is '.', (6,7) is '1', (7,5) is '2', (7,6) is '2', (7,7) is '1'. So, one bomb here. Maybe (6,5) is a bomb, but (6,5) is '.', so I could place a flag there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,7) is a bomb, but (5,7) is '1', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb.\n\nWait, cell (5,7) is '1', so it has one bomb nearby. Its neighbors are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (4,6) is '_', (4,7) is '_', (4,8) is '_', (5,6) is '2', (5,8) is '.', (6,6) is '1', (6,7) is '1', (6,8) is '.'. So, one bomb here. Maybe (4,6) or (4,7) is a bomb.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at cell (9,5) which is '1'. Its neighbors are (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6). Wait, the board is 10x10, so x and y go up to 9. So, (9,5)'s neighbors are (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,4) doesn't exist, so up to (8,4). So, (8,4) is '.', (8,5) is '1', (8,6) is '.', (9,4) is '.', (9,6) is '.', (8,4) is '.', (8,5) is '1', (8,6) is '.'. So, one bomb here. Maybe (8,5) is a bomb, but (8,5) is '1', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, the bomb must be in (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), or (9,6). But I don't see any flags yet.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a cell that is adjacent to multiple numbers and has only one possible spot for a bomb.\n\nLooking at cell (3,4) which is '1'. Its neighbors are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is '_', (2,4) is '_', (2,5) is '1', (3,3) is '2', (3,5) is '_', (4,3) is '.', (4,4) is '2', (4,5) is '_'. So, one bomb here. Maybe (4,5) is a bomb, but I don't see any flags yet.\n\nWait, cell (4,4) is '2'. Its neighbors include (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3) is '2', (3,4) is '1', (3,5) is '_', (4,3) is '.', (4,5) is '_', (5,3) is '.', (5,4) is '3', (5,5) is '2'. So, two bombs here. Maybe (4,5) and (5,5) are bombs, but (5,5) is '2', so it can't be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (4,5) and (5,4) are bombs, but (5,4) is '3', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to place a flag where I'm certain.\n\nWait, cell (0,0) is '.', and if it's a bomb, that would satisfy the '1's in (0,1) and (1,0). Let me check that.\n\nIf (0,0) is a bomb, then cell (0,1) which is '1' would have one bomb, which is (0,0). Similarly, cell (1,0) which is '1' would have one bomb, which is (0,0). That seems consistent.\n\nSo, maybe I should flag (0,0) as a bomb. Let me check the impact of that.\n\nIf (0,0) is a bomb, then cell (0,1) and (1,0) are satisfied. Now, looking at cell (1,1) which is '1', it's adjacent to (0,0), which is a bomb, so that's the one bomb it needs. So, the other neighbors can't have any bombs. So, (0,1) is '1', which is satisfied by (0,0). So, that's okay.\n\nSo, perhaps (0,0) is a bomb. Let me tentatively mark that as a flag.\n\nBut wait, I have 10 flags remaining, and 10 bombs, so I need to be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for cells that are adjacent to multiple '1's.\n\nLooking at cell (0,5) which is '1'. Its neighbors are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,4) is '_', (0,6) is '.', (1,4) is '_', (1,5) is '.', (1,6) is '1'. So, one bomb here. Maybe (0,4) is a bomb, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (1,6) is a bomb, but (1,6) is '1', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should look for a cell that is adjacent to two '1's and has only one possible spot for the bomb.\n\nLooking at cell (1,6) which is '1'. Its neighbors are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). (0,5) is '1', (0,6) is '.', (0,7) is '1', (1,5) is '.', (1,7) is '_', (2,5) is '1', (2,6) is '1', (2,7) is '1'. So, one bomb here. Maybe (2,5) is a bomb, but (2,5) is '1', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, the bomb must be in (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,6), or (2,7). But (2,6) and (2,7) are '1's, which are numbers, so they can't be bombs. So, the bomb must be in (0,6), (0,7), or (1,7). But I don't see any flags yet.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should make an educated guess.\n\nLooking back at cell (0,0), if I flag that, it would satisfy the '1's in (0,1) and (1,0). Let me try that.\n\nSo, I think I'll place a flag at (0,0). But wait, before I do that, I should check if that affects other numbers.\n\nIf (0,0) is a bomb, then cell (1,0) which is '1' is satisfied. Cell (0,1) which is '1' is also satisfied. Now, looking at cell (1,1) which is '1', it's adjacent to (0,0), which is a bomb, so that's its one bomb. So, the other neighbors can't have any bombs. So, (0,1) is '1', which is satisfied, (0,2) is '_', (1,0) is '1', (1,2) is '_', (2,0) is '_', (2,1) is '_', (2,2) is '_'. So, no other bombs here. So, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, I think I'll place a flag at (0,0). But wait, before I do that, I should check if that leaves enough bombs for the rest of the board.\n\nThere are 10 bombs in total, and I'm flagging one, so 9 left. I have 10 flags remaining, so I can afford to place this flag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a cell that's safe. Let's see.\n\nLooking at cell (4,4) which is '2'. Its neighbors are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). If (0,0) is a bomb, that doesn't affect this area. So, maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nWait, cell (5,4) is '3'. It's a high number, so three bombs around it. If I can find three bombs in its neighbors, that would help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a cell that's adjacent to multiple high numbers.\n\nLooking at cell (3,2) which is '3'. It's adjacent to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). If (3,2) is '3', there must be three bombs here. Maybe (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) are bombs. So, I could place flags there.\n\nBut I have 10 flags to place, so I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a cell that's adjacent to a '1' and has only one possible spot for the bomb.\n\nLooking at cell (6,6) which is '1'. Its neighbors are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5) is '2', (5,6) is '2', (5,7) is '1', (6,5) is '.', (6,7) is '1', (7,5) is '2', (7,6) is '2', (7,7) is '1'. So, one bomb here. Maybe (6,5) is a bomb, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,7) is a bomb, but (5,7) is '1', so it's a number, not a bomb.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a cell that's adjacent to a '1' and has only one possible spot for the bomb.\n\nLooking at cell (9,5) which is '1'. Its neighbors are (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,4), etc. (8,4) is '.', (8,5) is '1', (8,6) is '.', (9,4) is '.', (9,6) is '.', (8,4) is '.', (8,5) is '1', (8,6) is '.'. So, one bomb here. Maybe (8,5) is a bomb, but (8,5) is '1', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, the bomb must be in (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), or (9,6). But I don't see any flags yet.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should make a move somewhere else.\n\nLooking at row 9, cell (9,5) is '1'. Its neighbors are (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,4), etc. (8,4) is '.', (8,5) is '1', (8,6) is '.', (9,4) is '.', (9,6) is '.', (8,4) is '.', (8,5) is '1', (8,6) is '.'. So, one bomb here. Maybe (8,4) is a bomb, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (9,6) is a bomb, but I don't see any flags yet.\n\nI think I need to make a move. Since I'm stuck, I'll take a guess and flag (0,0) as a bomb. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nIf I flag (0,0), that would satisfy the '1's in (0,1) and (1,0). Then, I can proceed from there.\n\nSo, my next move would be to place a flag at (0,0).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the analysis, cell (0,0) is adjacent to two '1's, indicating it's likely a bomb. Placing a flag here satisfies the adjacent numbers and helps in solving the board.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,flag=true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . 1 _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n3 1 2 3 2 1 _ _ _ _ _\n4 . . . . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . . 3 2 2 1 _ _\n6 . . . . 2 . . 1 _ _\n7 . . . . . 2 2 1 _ _\n8 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n9 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _", "sucess": false}
