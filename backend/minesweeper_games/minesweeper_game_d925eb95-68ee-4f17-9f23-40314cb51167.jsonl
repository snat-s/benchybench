We know at least one of these must be wrong. Since removing flags is safer than placing new ones when there's uncertainty, we should remove one of these conflicting flags.\n\nEXPLANATION: Removing flag at (3,5) because it creates a conflict with the two '1's at (3,3) and (3,4). Each '1' can only have one adjacent bomb, but they're sharing two flags.\nMOVE: 3,5,true", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . 1 1 F F . . .\n4 . . . 1 3 3 F . . .\n5 . . .

Key observation:\nThe '3' at (4,5) requires one more bomb, and it can only be at (3,5) given the current configuration. This must be a bomb because:\n- The '3' at (4,5) already has 2 flags and needs exactly one more bomb\n- The only remaining unflagged adjacent tile is at (3,5)\n\nEXPLANATION: The tile at (3,5) must be a bomb to satisfy the '3' at (4,5) which already has two adjacent flags and requires exactly one more bomb.\n\nMOVE: 3,5,true", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . 1 1 .

Looking at safe moves:\nThe number pattern in rows 3-5 suggests we can safely reveal some tiles. Looking at (4,7), it's adjacent to a '3' at (4,4), but all three bombs that this '3' warns about are already flagged (at (3,5), (3,6), and (5,5)). Therefore, (4,7) must be safe.\n\nEXPLANATION: Since all bombs that the '3' at (4,4) warns about are already flagged, the tile at (4,7) must be safe to reveal.\nMOVE: 4,7,false", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . 1 1 F F . . .\n4 . . . 1 3 3 F . . .\n5 . . .
