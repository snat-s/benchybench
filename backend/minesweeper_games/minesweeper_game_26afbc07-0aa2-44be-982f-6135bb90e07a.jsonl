The adjacent unexplored squares are (0,2), (1,1), and (1,0).\n\n2. **Flag Counting:**\n   - There are no flags placed yet, and the total bombs are 10, with 10 flags remaining.\n   - Since the two '1' squares indicate that there is one bomb adjacent to them, we have a clear signal. \n\n3. **Possible Bomb Locations:**\n   - The bomb must be one of the unexplored squares adjacent to the '1's. This leads us to consider the following squares for potential bomb placements:\n     - (0,2)\n     - (1,0) has already counted for the first '1', so it may or may not be a bomb.\n     - (1,1) is unexplored and might be where an adjacent bomb is located.\n\n4. **Immediate Action:**\n   - Since revealing any of the adjacent squares (0,2) or (1,1) or (1,0) might shed more light on their values, we can approach this strategically. It's important also to note that (0,2) and (1,1) only give partial information about the '1's we have now.\n\n5. **Next Move Decision:**\n   - Let's reveal (0,2) to explore more of the potential bomb locations and see if it's a bomb or if it helps reveal any additional information.\n\nEXPLANATION: I chose to reveal the square at (0,2) to uncover more information about the surrounding bombs and reveal more of the board, as it is adjacent to the '1' squares.\n\nMOVE: 0,2,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 1 . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

The information from (1, 2) and (0, 2) indicates another bomb must be located either at (0, 2), (1, 2), or one of the open spaces around (1, 0).\n\nNow, since (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 0) can only have a total of 1 bomb based on the adjacent counts, and (1, 2) already has one identified possible bomb due to one flag, any further flags in those areas may cause a conflict.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best move is to reveal (1, 2) as it\u2019s a number \"2\" indicating that there's still another bomb nearby, suggesting that revealing it will yield further information.\n\nMOVE: 1,2,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 2 1 . . . . . .\n1 1 F 2 . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
