Since there\u2019s already a flag adjacent to (3,4), there cannot be another bomb adjacent to it.\n  \n2. **Number at (4,4)**: This shows '2' and has one adjacent flag at (3,5). This means there must be **exactly one more bomb** adjacent to (4,4). The possible adjacent unexplored squares are (3,3), (4,3), and (5,3).\n\n3. **Number at (5,4)**: This shows '2' and has no adjacent flags. The unexplored squares adjacent to it are (4,3), (5,3), and (6,3).\n\n4. **Number at (5,3)**: This shows '1' and has no adjacent flags. The unexplored squares adjacent to it are (4,3), (5,2), and (6,3).\n\n5. **Number at (4,3)**: This shows '2' and has no adjacent flags. The unexplored squares adjacent to it are (3,3), (4,2), (5,3), and (5,2).\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that:\n- The bomb adjacent to (4,4) must be at either (3,3), (4,3), or (5,3).\n- The bomb adjacent to (5,4) must be at either (4,3), (5,3), or (6,3).\n- The bomb adjacent to (5,3) must be at either (4,3), (5,2), or (6,3).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most logical move is to reveal (5,3) because it\u2019s a safe square based on the adjacent numbers.

Therefore, the remaining adjacent tiles are safe to reveal.\n\n2. **Position (2,5): '1'**\n   - Adjacent to `F` at `(3,5)`.\n   - Similar to `(2,4)`, since it's a '1' with one flagged bomb, the other adjacent tiles are safe.\n\n3. **Position (2,6): '1'**\n   - Adjacent to `F` at `(3,5)`.\n   - Again, a '1' with one flagged bomb means no other bombs are adjacent.\n\n4. **Position (3,3): '1'**\n   - Adjacent to `F` at `(3,5)`.\n   - '1' with one flagged bomb, so no other bombs are adjacent.\n\n5. **Position (3,4): '1'**\n   - Adjacent to `F` at `(3,5)`.\n   - '1' with one flagged bomb means no other bombs are adjacent.\n\n6. **Position (3,6): '1'**\n   - Adjacent to `F` at `(3,5)`.\n   - '1' with one flagged bomb implies no other bombs are adjacent.\n\n7. **Position (4,4): '2'**\n   - Adjacent to `F` at `(3,5)`.\n   - Since it's a '2' and there's one flagged bomb adjacent, there must be one more bomb adjacent to it.\n\n8. **Position (4,6): '2'**\n   - Adjacent to `F` at `(3,5)`.\n   - Similar to `(4,4)`, it's a '2' with one flagged bomb, so there must be one more bomb adjacent.\n\n9. **Position (5,3): '1'**\n   - Adjacent to `F` at `(3,5)`.\n   - '1' with one flagged bomb means no other bombs are adjacent.\n\n10. **Position (5,4): '2'**\n    - Adjacent to `F` at `(3,5)`.\n    - '2' with one flagged bomb implies there must be one more bomb adjacent.\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following positions are safe to reveal:\n\n- All adjacent tiles to `(2,4)`, `(2,5)`, `(2,6)`, `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`, `(3,6)`, and `(5,3)` that are unexplored (`.`).\n\nLet's list these safe tiles:\n\n1. **Position (1,3)**: Adjacent to `(2,4)`\n2. **Position (1,4)**: Adjacent to `(2,4)`\n3. **Position (1,5)**: Adjacent to `(2,5)`\n4. **Position (1,6)**: Adjacent to `(2,6)`\n5. **Position (2,3)**: Adjacent to `(3,3)`\n6. **Position (4,3)**: Adjacent to `(3,3)`\n7. **Position (4,5)**: Adjacent to `(3,5)`\n8. **Position (4,7)**: Adjacent to `(3,6)`\n9. **Position (5,5)**: Adjacent to `(5,4)`\n10. **Position (6,3)**: Adjacent to `(5,3)`\n11. **Position (6,4)**: Adjacent to `(5,4)`\n\nHowever, some of these positions might already be revealed or flagged. Let's check the board:\n\n- `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`, `(1,5)`, `(1,6)`, `(2,3)`, `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, `(4,7)`, `(5,5)`, `(6,3)`, `(6,4)` are all marked as `.` (unexplored).\n\nTherefore, all these positions are safe to reveal.\n\n### Deciding the Next Move\n\nSince there are multiple safe tiles, choosing any one of them would be a valid move. To strategize, it's often beneficial to reveal tiles that can provide the most information, typically those adjacent to multiple numbers.\n\nLooking at the safe tiles:\n\n- **Position (1,4)**: Adjacent to `(2,4)`.\n- **Position (1,5)**: Adjacent to `(2,5)`.\n- **Position (2,3)**: Adjacent to `(3,3)`.\n\nChoosing a tile like `(2,3)` could be advantageous because it's adjacent to `(3,3)`, which is a '1' and already has one flagged bomb adjacent. Revealing `(2,3)` would confirm whether there are any bombs in that direction, further helping in deducing the locations of other bombs.\n\n### Verifying the Move\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that revealing `(2,3)` doesn't lead to any conflicts:\n\n- `(2,3)` is unexplored.\n- It's adjacent to `(3,3)`, which is a '1' with one flagged bomb at `(3,5)`.\n- Therefore, `(2,3)` should be safe to reveal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRevealing tile `(2,3)` is a safe move that can provide additional information to progress in the game.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```\nEXPLANATION: Revealing tile (2,3) is safe as it's adjacent to a '1' with one flagged bomb, ensuring no bomb is present there.\nMOVE: 2,3,false\n```", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . 1 1 1 . . .\n3 . . . 1 1 F 1 . . .\n4 . . . . 2 1 2 . . .\n5 . . . 1 2 . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

If there's a discrepancy, it could indicate an error in flag placement or a potential bomb location.\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n\n- **Position (0,3):** Displays '1'.\n  - Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n  - Currently, none of these adjacent cells are flagged.\n  - Since the number is '1', there should be exactly one bomb in these adjacent cells.\n\n- **Position (3,1):** Displays '1'.\n  - Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n  - (3,2) is flagged (`F`).\n  - Since there's already one flag adjacent, there should be no other bombs in the remaining adjacent cells.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Obvious Conflicts**\n\nLook for any revealed numbers that have more flags adjacent than the number indicates, or where the number of flags doesn't match the number of adjacent bombs.\n\n**Example:**\n\n- **Position (3,5):** Displays '1' and is flagged (`F`).\n  - Adjacent cells: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n  - Currently, only (3,5) is flagged.\n  - The number '1' indicates that there should be exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (3,5) is already flagged, there should be no other bombs in these adjacent cells.\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Remaining Flags vs. Bombs**\n\nThere are 10 bombs on the board and 9 flags remaining. This means we have used 1 flag so far (at (3,5)).\n\n**Implications:**\n\n- We need to be cautious when placing new flags to ensure they don't exceed the number of bombs.\n- If we place a flag where there isn't a bomb, it could lead to incorrect deductions later in the game.\n\n### **Step 4: Deciding the Next Move**\n\nBased on the analysis, let's identify a safe move to reveal more tiles or to place a flag if a bomb's location is certain.\n\n**Potential Moves:**\n\n1. **Revealing a Tile:**\n   - Look for a tile that, when revealed, will provide more information.\n   - For example, revealing (4,3) could help determine the presence of bombs around (3,3) and (5,3).\n\n2. **Placing a Flag:**\n   - If we can conclusively determine that a tile contains a bomb based on the surrounding numbers, we can place a flag.\n   - For example, if a number '2' has only one adjacent flag, the other adjacent unexplored tile must be a bomb.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nAfter careful consideration, let's choose to reveal a tile that can provide more information without risking a bomb.\n\n**Move:**\n\nLet's reveal tile (4,3). This tile is unexplored (`.`) and revealing it can help us understand the surrounding numbers better.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Revealing tile (4,3) will provide more information about the adjacent numbers, particularly around positions (3,3) and (5,3), aiding in further deductions about potential bomb locations.\n\n**MOVE:** 4,3,false\n\n```\nMOVE: 4,3,false\n```\n\nThis move is strategic as it reduces uncertainty in a critical area of the board, allowing for more informed decisions in subsequent turns.", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n2 1 1 _ 1 1 1 1 . . .\n3 . 1 1 1 1 F 1 . . .\n4 . . . . 2 1 2 . . .\n5 . . . 1 2 . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
