There are 10 total bombs, and I see 9 flags already placed (at (0,5), (1,8), (1,9), (2,2), (2,3), (2,9), (3,9), (5,7), (7,7)).\n2. I notice we have 0 flags remaining, meaning all 10 bombs should be flagged. This suggests one flag might be incorrectly placed.\n3. Let me check the revealed numbers against adjacent flags:\n   - At (2,6): The \"1\" is satisfied by the flag at (2,3)\n   - At (3,6): The \"1\" is satisfied by the flag at (3,9)\n   - At (5,6): The \"1\" is satisfied by the flag at (5,7)\n   - At (1,6): The \"1\" is adjacent to flag at (1,8)\n   - At (6,6): The \"1\" must have a bomb at (7,7)\n   - At (0,8): The \"1\" is satisfied by the flag at (1,8)\n\n4. At (7,6), there's a \"2\" with only one adjacent flag (at 7,7). This indicates there must be another bomb adjacent, likely at (7,5), (7,8), (8,7), or (6,7).\n\n5. At (8,6), there's also a \"2\" with one adjacent flag (at 7,7). This means there must be another bomb in its vicinity.\n\n6. The \"2\" at coordinate (4,2) should have exactly 2 bombs adjacent to it.\n\nLooking at all this information, I can see a conflict if we have only 9 flags but need 10. Since we have 0 flags remaining, I must make a safe reveal move.\n\nThe safest move appears to be at (0,6) since it's adjacent to the revealed \"1\" at (0,4) which is already satisfied by the flag at (0,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: I'm revealing (0,6) because the adjacent \"1\" at (0,4) already has its bomb accounted for with the flag at (0,5), making this a safe square to reveal.\n\nMOVE: 0,6,false", "flags_remaining": 0, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 F _ _ 1 .\n1 . 1 1 1 1 _ 1 1 F F\n2 1 1 F F _ _ 1 . 2 F\n3 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 F\n4 . . 2 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . 1 1 1 1 F _ _\n6 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n7 . . .
