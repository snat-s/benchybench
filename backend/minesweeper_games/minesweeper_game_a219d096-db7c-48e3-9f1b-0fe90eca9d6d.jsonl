Since there is already a '1' at position (1,3), it's likely that the bomb is located at position (0,2) or (0,6) or (1,2) or other adjacent positions, but we can't be sure yet.\n\nHowever, looking at the middle-left area, we see a '2' at position (2,1) and a '1' at position (2,3). There is also a '1' at position (1,3). Given the constraints, it's likely that the bomb is located at position (2,2).\n\nConsidering the remaining number of flags vs bombs, we still have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs to find. \n\nTherefore, my next move is to place a flag at position (2,2).\n\nMOVE: 2,2,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 . 2 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n2 . 2 _ 1 . 1 _ 1 1 1\n3 . 2 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ _\n4 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . 2 1 2 1 1 _ _ _ _\n6 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n7 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 .\n8 1 1 _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .", "sucess": true}

Looking at the adjacent numbers, we can see that the number '2' at position (1,1) and (2,1) already has one adjacent flag. However, the number '2' at position (1,1) also has another '1' at position (1,3), which suggests that the bomb is likely to be at position (1,2) or (0,2) rather than (1,0) or (2,0) due to the '1' at position (0,1). However, we can see that the number '1' at position (0,1) and (0,8) has no adjacent flags yet. Considering the number '2' at position (1,1) and the '1' at position (0,1), it seems more likely that the bomb is at position (1,0) rather than (0,2) or (1,2). However, we can't be certain yet.\n\nLooking at the number '1' at position (0,8), we can see that it has no adjacent flags yet. Since the number '1' indicates exactly one bomb, we can place a flag at one of its adjacent positions. Considering the number '1' at position (8,5), it seems more likely that the bomb is at position (0,9) rather than (0,7).\n\nHowever, we can see that the number '2' at position (5,1) has no adjacent flags yet. Considering the number '1' at position (4,5), it seems more likely that one of the bombs is at position (5,0) rather than (4,1) or (6,1).\n\nConsidering the remaining number of flags vs bombs, we still have 9 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total. We have already placed 1 flag, so we need to place 9 more flags.\n\nLooking at the current state of the board, we can see that the position (8,0) has a number '1' at position (8,5) and a number '1' at position (7,1). However, the position (9,5) has a number '1' which suggests that the bomb is likely to be at position (9,4), (8,4), or (9,6) rather than (9,5). However, we can see that the number '1' at position (8,0) has no adjacent flags yet.

We can start by analyzing the revealed numbers and their adjacent tiles. The number '1' at position (0,1) suggests that there is a bomb adjacent to it. Since there is already a flag at position (2,2), we should look for other potential locations for the bomb. The number '2' at position (1,1) also indicates that there are two bombs adjacent to it. Considering the flag at position (2,2) and the number '1' at position (0,1), it's likely that the bomb is located at position (1,0) or (0,2). However, we can't be certain without more information.\n\nLet's look at the number '1' at position (2,3). It indicates that there is a bomb adjacent to it. Since there is already a flag at position (2,2), the bomb can't be at position (2,2). The most likely location for the bomb is at position (2,4) or (3,3). However, we can't flag any of these positions without more information.\n\nConsidering the remaining number of flags (8) and bombs (10), we should be cautious not to flag too many tiles without sufficient evidence. Let's reveal a tile that is likely to provide more information.\n\nThe tile at position (4,4) is a good candidate.
