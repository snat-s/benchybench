However, since (0,1) and (1,0) cannot both be bombs (because (0,0) and (1,1) each can only have one bomb), and (1,1) actually can be associated firmly with the bomb position, we should place a flag where cross-pattern between both could converge correctly.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. Flag the (0,1) square since it is the only adjacent square to (0,0) that can logically have a bomb without re-positioning the known '1' adjacent values.\n2. Flag the (1,0) square as it is next to the (1,1)'1', isn't yet causing other complex model conflicts but better flag than as safer points otherwise yet unrevealed.\n\nHowever, reconsidering our step-by-step logic and ensuring our complete model confirms logically:\nThe minimal yet critical correct, next step is likely uncovering adjacent and clear values revealing available pattern a modelled for sure trigger crossing safe flags first clearly validate.\n\n### Move:\nPlace a flag on a clear, close adjacent at least moves confirmed most forms sub-steps would otherwise completing guarding successive state-clear make sure:\n\n```EXPLANATION: Flag a box since we need to reveal adjacent clearing sure and unfold extra cross validations before revealing further completing higher division forms sets next box wouldn't conflicting due to reset cross-model analytic:\nMOVE: 1,0,flag\n```\n\nLet's proceed with this move and check the updated board state.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 . 1 . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
