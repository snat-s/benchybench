In Minesweeper, the first move is always a \"safe\" move where you typically choose a corner or center square to minimize the risk of hitting a bomb.\n\nEXPLANATION: For the first move, I recommend revealing a corner or center tile to minimize initial risk. Given the symmetry of this board, I'll choose the top-left corner.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,false\n\nRationale:\n- First moves are statistically low-risk\n- Corners have fewer adjacent squares to potentially contain bombs\n- Revealing this square will help start uncovering the board's initial configuration\n- If this reveals a number, it will provide early strategic information\n- If this reveals a blank space, it will likely auto-reveal surrounding empty tiles\n\nWould you like me to proceed with revealing the (0,0) coordinate?", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
