That '1' already has its bomb accounted for with the flag at (7,4), so all other adjacent cells must be safe. I can safely reveal (8,4), which is directly left of the '1' at (8,5).\n\nMOVE: 8,4,false", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n1 . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n2 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n3 . 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 2 .\n4 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n5 . 2 1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n6 . . 1 _ F F _ _ 1 .\n7 . . 1 1 F 1 F F 1 .\n8 . . . . . 3 1 1 1 .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
