This suggests that there is no bomb adjacent to (0,6), so the bomb must be elsewhere.\n\n3. **Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs:**\n   - There are 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining, so we need to be careful with flag placement.\n\n4. **Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile:**\n   - Given the conflict at (0,6) and (1,7), it is safe to reveal the adjacent squares to (0,6) that are unrevealed.\n\n### Move:\nEXPLANATION: The number '1' at (0,6) conflicts with the revealed '1' at (1,7), so it is safe to reveal the adjacent unrevealed squares.\nMOVE: 2,6,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 1\n2 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 . . 2 2 2 1 _ _ _ _\n4 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . . . 2 2 1 _ _ 1 1\n6 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ 2 .\n7 1 2 . 1 _ _ _ _ 2 .\n8 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}

Let's examine the revealed numbers and their adjacent squares.\n\n#### Row 0:\n- **Cell (0,6):** Shows `1`. Adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7).\n  - **Flagged cells:** None adjacent.\n  - **Unexplored cells:** (0,5), (1,5), (1,7).\n\n#### Row 1:\n- **Cell (1,6):** Shows `1`. Adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7).\n  - **Flagged cells:** None adjacent.\n  - **Unexplored cells:** (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7).\n\n#### Row 2:\n- **Cell (2,0):** Shows `1`. Adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1).\n  - **Flagged cells:** (2,1) is flagged (`F`).\n  - **Unexplored cells:** (1,0), (1,1), (3,0), (3,1).\n\nSince cell (2,0) has a `1` and already has one adjacent flag at (2,1), there cannot be another bomb adjacent to it. Therefore, the unexplored adjacent cells are safe to reveal.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- **Cell (3,2):** Shows `2`. Adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n  - **Flagged cells:** (2,1) is flagged (`F`).\n  - **Unexplored cells:** (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nCell (3,2) shows `2` and has one adjacent flag at (2,1). This means there must be exactly one more bomb among the unexplored adjacent cells.\n\n#### Row 5:\n- **Cell (5,3):** Shows `2`. Adjacent cells are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n  - **Flagged cells:** None adjacent.\n  - **Unexplored cells:** (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\n#### Row 6:\n- **Cell (6,3):** Shows `1`. Adjacent cells are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4).\n  - **Flagged cells:** None adjacent.\n  - **Unexplored cells:** (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4).\n\n#### Row 7:\n- **Cell (7,1):** Shows `2`. Adjacent cells are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2).\n  - **Flagged cells:** None adjacent.\n  - **Unexplored cells:** (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2).\n\n#### Row 8:\n- **Cell (8,1):** Shows `1`. Adjacent cells are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2).\n  - **Flagged cells:** None adjacent.\n  - **Unexplored cells:** (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2).\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves and Potential Bombs\n\nBased on the above analysis, let's identify safe moves and potential bombs.\n\n#### Safe Reveals:\n- **Cell (1,0):** Adjacent to cell (2,0) which has a `1` and already has a flag at (2,1). Therefore, (1,0) is safe.\n- **Cell (3,0):** Adjacent to cell (2,0) which has a `1` and already has a flag at (2,1). Therefore, (3,0) is safe.\n\n#### Potential Bombs:\n- **Cell (3,1):** Adjacent to cell (3,2) which shows `2` and has one flag at (2,1). Thus, there must be one more bomb among (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n  - **Further analysis needed** to determine which of these cells contain the bomb.\n\n### Deciding the Next Move\n\nGiven the analysis, the safest move is to reveal the cells that are confirmed safe based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\n**Safe Reveals:**\n1. **Cell (1,0):** Adjacent to cell (2,0) which has a `1` and already has a flag at (2,1). Therefore, (1,0) is safe to reveal.\n2. **Cell (3,0):** Similarly, adjacent to cell (2,0) which has a `1` and already has a flag at (2,1). Therefore, (3,0) is safe to reveal.\n\nBetween these two, **Cell (1,0)** is a more strategic choice because revealing it may provide more information about the surrounding cells, especially concerning cell (1,1) and (0,0).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the board, the safest and most strategic move is to reveal **Cell (1,0)**, as it is guaranteed to be safe based on the adjacent numbers and existing flags.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nEXPLANATION: Cell (1,0) is adjacent to cell (2,0) which shows '1' and already has a flag at (2,1), ensuring that (1,0) is safe to reveal.\nMOVE: 1,0,false\n```", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 1\n2 1 F 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 . . 2 2 2 1 _ _ _ _\n4 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . . . 2 2 1 _ _ 1 1\n6 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ 2 .\n7 1 2 . 1 _ _ _ _ 2 .\n8 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
