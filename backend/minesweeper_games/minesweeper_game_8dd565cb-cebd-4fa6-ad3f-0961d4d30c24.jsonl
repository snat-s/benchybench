However, we need more information to pinpoint the exact location.\n\n#### **Cell (1,4) - '2':**\n- Adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n  \n  We know that (0,4) is '1', so one bomb is already accounted for in its adjacent cells. Therefore, there must be one more bomb among the remaining adjacent cells of (1,4).\n\n#### **Cell (2,3) - '1':**\n- Adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n  \n  Cell (1,4) is '2', which influences this area.

There must be one more bomb among (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n  \n**Again, without more data, it's challenging to make a safe move.**\n\n#### **Cell (2,3) - '1':**\n- Adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n  \n**Analyzing these, (1,4) is '2', which might influence the bomb placement.**\n\n#### **Cell (2,4) - '2':**\n- Adjacent cells: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n  \n**Similar to previous cells, deducing bomb locations is complex.**\n\n#### **Cell (3,1) - '1':**\n- Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n  \n**All adjacent cells are unexplored, making it impossible to deduce safely.**\n\n#### **Cell (3,2) - '1':**\n- Adjacent cells: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n  \n**Similarly, without more information, it's risky to reveal any adjacent cells.**\n\n#### **Cell (3,3) - '2':**\n- Adjacent cells: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n  \n**Complex, as multiple clues are involved.**\n\n#### **Cell (4,1) - '1':**\n- Adjacent cells: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)\n  \n**All adjacent cells are unexplored, making it challenging to deduce bomb locations.**\n\n#### **Cell (5,0) - '2':**\n- Adjacent cells: (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1)\n  \n**All adjacent cells are unexplored.**\n\n#### **Cell (5,1) - '3':**\n- Adjacent cells: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)\n  \n**All adjacent cells are unexplored.**\n\n### **Looking for Safe Cells to Reveal**\n\nGiven that many cells have unexplored adjacent cells, it's challenging to find a safe cell to reveal without risking hitting a bomb. However, let's consider the cells with the least number of adjacent unexplored cells to minimize risk.\n\n#### **Cell (6,0) - Adjacent to (5,0) - '2':**\n- Adjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (6,1)\n  \n  Since (5,0) is '2' and all adjacent cells are unexplored, revealing (6,0) is risky as it could be a bomb.\n\n#### **Cell (6,1) - Adjacent to (5,0) - '2' and (5,1) - '3':**\n- Adjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2)\n  \n  Similarly, revealing (6,1) is risky due to multiple adjacent unexplored cells.\n\n#### **Cell (6,2) - Adjacent to (5,1) - '3':**\n- Adjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,3)\n  \n  Again, revealing (6,2) is risky.\n\n#### **Cell (6,3) - Adjacent to (5,2) - unexplored:**\n- Adjacent cells: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (6,4)\n  \n  Revealing (6,3) is also risky.\n\n#### **Cell (4,0) - Adjacent to (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0):**\n- All adjacent cells are unexplored.\n  \n  Revealing (4,0) is risky.\n\n#### **Cell (4,2) - Adjacent to (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2):**\n- All adjacent cells are unexplored.\n  \n  Revealing (4,2) is risky.\n\n#### **Cell (4,3) - Adjacent to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3):**\n- All adjacent cells are unexplored.\n  \n  Revealing (4,3) is risky.\n\n#### **Cell (4,4) - Adjacent to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4):**\n- All adjacent cells are unexplored.\n  \n  Revealing (4,4) is risky.\n\n#### **Cell (2,2) - Adjacent to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3):**\n- All adjacent cells are unexplored.\n  \n  Revealing (2,2) is risky.\n\n#### **Cell (2,1) - Adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2):**\n- All adjacent cells are unexplored.\n  \n  Revealing (2,1) is risky.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully analyzing each numbered cell and their adjacent unexplored cells, it's evident that making a move without risking hitting a bomb is quite challenging at this stage. The board still has a significant number of unexplored cells, and the numbers revealed do not provide enough information to definitively determine the location of bombs or safe cells.\n\nHowever, to proceed, I'll look for the least risky move based on the current information.\n\n### **Proposed Move**\n\nGiven the analysis, I'll choose to reveal cell (0,3) because it's adjacent to cell (0,4) which shows '1'. Revealing this cell might provide more information about the adjacent bombs.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- Cell (0,4) shows '1', indicating that there is exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n- By revealing cell (0,3), we can determine whether it's a bomb or safe, which will help in deducing the locations of other bombs in the vicinity.\n\n**MOVE:**\n```\nEXPLANATION: Revealing cell (0,3) to gather more information about adjacent bombs near cell (0,4).\nMOVE: 0,3,false\n```\n\nThis move is chosen to minimize risk while maximizing the potential for gaining more information about the board's bomb placements.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 2 . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 2 . . . . .\n3 _ 1 1 2 . . . . . .\n4 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n5 2 3 . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Position (3,1) with number `1`:**\n   - Adjacent squares: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n   - Currently, all adjacent squares are unexplored (`.`).\n\n**f. Position (3,2) with number `1`:**\n   - Adjacent squares: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n   - Currently, all adjacent squares are unexplored (`.`).\n\n**g. Position (3,3) with number `2`:**\n   - Adjacent squares: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n   - Currently, all adjacent squares are unexplored (`.`).\n\n**h.

However, we can look for numbers where the number of adjacent unexplored squares equals the number indicated, suggesting that all those squares are bombs.\n\n**Example: Position (0,4) with number `1`:**\n   - Five adjacent squares: (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n   - Since there's only one bomb adjacent, and all squares are unexplored, it's uncertain which one is the bomb.\n\nSimilarly, for most other positions, multiple unexplored squares make it hard to deduce bomb locations.\n\n### Considering the Remaining Flags\n\nWe have **10 flags remaining** and **10 bombs** on the board. This means we need to be strategic about where we place flags to ensure we don't run out before all bombs are identified.\n\n### Making the First Move\n\nGiven the uncertainty in bomb placements, the safest initial move is to reveal a square that is least likely to be a bomb. Typically, corners and edges are safer bets since they have fewer adjacent squares.\n\n**Choosing Position (0,0):**\n   - It's a corner with only three adjacent squares: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n   - Revealing this square could provide more information to build upon.\n\n**Potential Outcomes:**\n   - If it reveals a number, we can use that information to deduce bomb placements.\n   - If it reveals a bomb, the game ends, but statistically, corners are less likely to be bombs.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, the next logical move is to reveal the square at position (0,0) to gather more information and reduce uncertainty about bomb placements.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Revealing the corner square at (0,0) is a safe initial move to gather more information about adjacent bomb placements and to minimize the risk of hitting a bomb.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 2 . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 2 . . . . .\n3 _ 1 1 2 . . . . . .\n4 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n5 2 3 . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

However, we don't have enough information yet to place a flag there.\n\nGiven this analysis, the safest move is to reveal the square at (3,1), as it must be safe based on the existing flag and number.\n\nMOVE: 3,1,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 2 . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 2 . . . . .\n3 _ 1 1 2 . . . . . .\n4 F 1 . . . . . . . .\n5 2 3 . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

This is likely a bomb.  \n   - **Tile (5,0):** Revealed '2'. Adjacent to the flag at (4,0). So, there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to (5,0).  \n   - **Tile (5,1):** Revealed '3'. Adjacent to the flag at (4,0). So, there must be exactly two more bombs adjacent to (5,1).  \n   - **Tile (4,1):** Revealed '1'. Adjacent to the flag at (4,0). So, there cannot be any more bombs adjacent to (4,1).  \n   - **Tile (3,1):** Revealed '1'. Not adjacent to any flags, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to it.  \n   - **Tile (3,2):** Revealed '1'. Not adjacent to any flags, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to it.  \n   - **Tile (3,3):** Revealed '2'. Not adjacent to any flags, so there must be exactly two bombs adjacent to it.  \n   - **Tile (2,3):** Revealed '1'. Not adjacent to any flags, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to it.  \n   - **Tile (1,4):** Revealed '2'. Not adjacent to any flags, so there must be exactly two bombs adjacent to it.  \n   - **Tile (0,4):** Revealed '1'. Not adjacent to any flags, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to it.  \n\n2. **Obvious Conflicts:**  \n   - No obvious conflicts detected. The flagged tile at (4,0) is consistent with the adjacent numbers.\n\n3. **Remaining Flags vs Bombs:**  \n   - Flags remaining: 9  \n   - Bombs remaining: 10  \n   - One bomb is already flagged at (4,0), so 9 bombs are left to be flagged.\n\n4. **Potential Moves:**  \n   - **Tile (5,2):** Unexplored (.). Adjacent to (5,1) which shows '3' and already has one bomb adjacent (at (4,0)). There must be exactly two more bombs adjacent to (5,1). Since (5,2) is adjacent to (5,1), it is a strong candidate for a bomb.  \n   - **Tile (4,2):** Unexplored (.). Adjacent to (4,1) which shows '1' and already has one bomb adjacent (at (4,0)). Therefore, (4,2) cannot be a bomb. It is safe to reveal.  \n\n### DECISION:  \nReveal tile (4,2) since it cannot be a bomb based on the adjacent numbers and existing flags.\n\n### MOVE:  \nEXPLANATION: Tile (4,2) is safe to reveal because it cannot be a bomb based on the adjacent numbers and existing flags.  \nMOVE: 4,2,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 2 . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 2 . . . . .\n3 _ 1 1 2 . . . . . .\n4 F 1 . . . . . . . .\n5 2 3 . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
