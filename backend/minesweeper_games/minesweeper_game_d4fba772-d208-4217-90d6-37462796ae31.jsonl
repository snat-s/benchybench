This means there must be another bomb adjacent to the '2'. Considering the remaining number of flags vs bombs, we still have 8 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total. We should focus on finding obvious conflicts or potential bomb locations.\n\nOne potential location for a bomb is below the '2' at position (1,2), but we can't be certain yet. However, looking at the bottom part of the board, we see a '1' at position (5,4) with four '1's adjacent to it. This suggests that there might be a bomb below the '1' at position (6,4), but we already have a '2' at position (6,5), which could indicate a bomb to its left or right.\n\nConsidering the critical flag placement rules, we should avoid placing a flag that conflicts with the revealed numbers. Instead, we can try to reveal a tile that is likely to be safe. Looking at the top-right corner, we see a '1' at position (0,6) with an empty revealed space above it. The adjacent tiles to the '1' are mostly unexplored, but revealing the tile to its right at position (0,7) could provide more information without risking a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 .
