{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing Minesweeper, and I just started a new game. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs to find. I have 10 flags left, which makes sense because each flag should mark a bomb. Let me look at the board state.\n\nRight now, every square is either a '.' which means it's unexplored, or an empty space. No numbers, flags, or bombs are visible yet. So, I'm at the very beginning. I need to make my first move.\n\nIn Minesweeper, the first move is always a bit risky because there's no information to go on. But sometimes, people choose the center or a corner. I remember that in some strategies, choosing the center can be better because it might reveal more information faster. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nWait, the board is 10x10, so the center would be around (5,5). But maybe I should start somewhere else. Let me think about the rules. Each number shows exactly the number of adjacent bombs. So, if I reveal a square and it's a number, I can use that information to deduce where the bombs are.\n\nBut since all squares are unexplored, I can't base my move on any existing numbers. So, I have to make an educated guess. I think the best approach is to start in the middle because it has more adjacent squares, which might give me more information if I hit a number. Alternatively, starting at the edge might be safer, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere. But wait, I have 10 flags and 10 bombs, so I need to flag all the bombs. But without any information, placing a flag randomly isn't helpful. So, probably, my first move should be to reveal a square.\n\nLet me think about the coordinate system. The top-left is (0,0), and the bottom-right is (9,9). So, if I choose (5,5), that's the center. But maybe I should start at (0,0) just to get some information. But if I hit a bomb there, the game ends. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, I could choose a corner, like (0,0), but again, it's risky. Maybe I should start somewhere in the middle but not exactly the center. Let's say (4,4). That way, if it's a number, I can see adjacent squares.\n\nWait, but without any prior information, any revealed square is equally risky. So, maybe I should just pick a random square. But to make a strategic choice, perhaps I should aim for a square that, if it's a number, gives me the most information.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that the bombs are distributed randomly, so the probability of hitting a bomb is the same anywhere. Since there are 10 bombs on a 100-square board, each square has a 10% chance of being a bomb. So, any square I choose has a 10% chance of being a bomb.\n\nBut since I want to survive, maybe I should start in a place where, if I hit a number, I can use that to find the bombs. So, perhaps the best approach is to pick a square and see what happens.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to provide a move. So, I need to decide where to click or flag. Since I have no information, I can't place a flag. So, I have to reveal a square.\n\nI think I'll go with the center square, (5,5). That's because it's in the middle, and if it's a number, it will have the most adjacent squares, giving me more clues. But if it's a bomb, the game ends. So, it's a risk, but it's a calculated one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start at (0,0) just to get the game going. But if I hit a bomb there, I lose immediately. So, perhaps starting in the middle is better.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes, the first move is safe in some versions of Minesweeper, but I don't think that's the case here. So, I have to assume that any square could be a bomb.\n\nSo, I'll choose (5,5) as my first move. Let's see what happens. If it's a number, I can use that to deduce the location of bombs. If it's a bomb, well, the game ends, but that's a risk I take.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start at (4,4) or (5,4). But I think (5,5) is a good starting point because it's the exact center, and it has the most adjacent squares, which can help me get more information if I hit a number.\n\nSo, my move is to reveal the square at (5,5). I'll set flag to false because I'm revealing it, not placing a flag.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Starting in the center of the board (5,5) to gather initial information and maximize the potential for revealing adjacent numbers that can help deduce bomb locations.\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
