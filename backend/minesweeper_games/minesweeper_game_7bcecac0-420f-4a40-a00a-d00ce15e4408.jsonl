{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. The board is 10x10, and right now, all the squares are unexplored, which means they're all dots. I have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs on the board. Since I haven't made any moves yet, everything is still hidden.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Minesweeper, the goal is to reveal all the safe squares without hitting a bomb. But since I don't have any information yet, I need to start somewhere. Usually, people start by clicking in the middle or somewhere that could give them the most information. But since I can choose to either reveal a square or place a flag, I have to decide which is better.\n\nWait, but I don't have any revealed numbers yet, so placing a flag might not be the best idea. If I place a flag where there's no bomb, I'll lose a flag, and if I place it correctly, that's good, but without any information, it's just a guess. On the other hand, revealing a square could give me a number, which would help me figure out where the bombs are.\n\nSo, maybe I should start by revealing a square. But which one? Since the board is empty, it doesn't matter much, but maybe starting near the center could help spread out the information better. Let's say I choose (5,5) as my first move. That's the middle of the board, so it might give me a number that affects the most surrounding squares.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people start at the edges because corners have fewer adjacent squares, but since all are unexplored, it's the same. Maybe I'll go with (0,0) just to have a starting point. But wait, (0,0) is a corner, so it only has three adjacent squares. If I reveal that and it's a 0, that would tell me the surrounding squares are safe, but if it's a 1, that gives me some info too.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should just pick a random square. Let's say I pick (3,4). No particular reason, just a random spot. Revealing that could give me a number, and then I can go from there.\n\nWait, but since I have 10 flags, maybe I should try to place a flag somewhere. But without any information, it's a 10% chance of being correct, which is low. So, probably better to reveal a square first to get some info.\n\nSo, I think I'll choose to reveal a square. Let's pick (5,5) as my first move. That way, if it's a number, I can start deducing from there. If it's a bomb, well, the game ends, but I guess that's a risk I have to take.\n\nWait, but if I reveal a square and it's a bomb, the game is over. Since I'm just starting, I don't want that. Maybe I should choose a corner first because it has fewer adjacent squares, so the chance of hitting a bomb might be lower? Or maybe not, since the distribution is random.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. But I think revealing a square is better than placing a flag blindly. So I'll go with revealing (5,5). Let's see what happens.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: I'm starting by revealing a central square to gain initial information about the board, which will help in making informed decisions for subsequent moves.\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 6, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me look at the board state and the game info to decide what to do.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10 with 10 bombs. There are 10 flags remaining, which means I can flag all the bombs if I find them. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without revealing any.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares have numbers indicating adjacent bombs. My first step is to check the revealed numbers against existing flags to see if there are any conflicts.\n\nStarting from the top, row 2 has some numbers. At (2,0) it's 1, and (2,1) is 1, (2,2) is 1, (2,3) is 1, (2,4) is 2, (2,5) is 3, and (2,6) is unexplored. Hmm, so row 2 has several numbers, which might help in deducing where the bombs are.\n\nLooking at row 3, it's mostly empty except for (3,5) which is 1, (3,6) is 1, (3,7) is 2, and (3,8) is empty. Row 4 has some numbers too: (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1, (4,3) is 1, (4,4) is empty, and from (4,7) onwards it's 1,1,1. So row 4 might have some bombs around those numbers.\n\nRow 5 has (5,0) as 1, (5,1) as 3, (5,3) as 2, and the rest are unexplored. Row 6 has (6,3) as 2, (6,4) as 1, (6,5) as 1, (6,6) as 1, and (6,7) is empty. Row 7 has (7,6) as 1. Row 8 has (8,3) as 1, (8,4) as 1, (8,5) as 1, (8,6) as 1, and (8,7) is empty. Row 9 has (9,3) as 1.\n\nNow, I should look for obvious conflicts. For example, if a square with a 1 has two flags around it, that's a conflict because it can only have one bomb adjacent. But looking at the board, I don't see any flags placed yet, so that's not an issue here.\n\nNext, I need to consider the remaining flags versus bombs. There are 10 bombs and 10 flags, so each bomb should be flagged exactly once.\n\nI think the best approach is to look for squares that are likely to be bombs based on the numbers around them. For instance, if a square is adjacent to a number that can't have any more bombs around it, that square might be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 2, the square at (2,5) is 3, meaning it has three bombs around it. The squares around it are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). Some of these are already numbers, like (2,4)=2, (2,6)=., (3,5)=1, (3,6)=1. So maybe some of the unexplored squares around (2,5) could be bombs.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to tell. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to a number that can only have one possibility. For example, if a square is next to a 1 and all other adjacent squares are revealed, then that square must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (3,7)=2. It has two bombs adjacent. The squares around it are (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). (2,6) is unexplored, (2,7) is unexplored, (3,6)=1, (3,8) is empty, (4,6) is empty, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1. So maybe the bombs are in (2,6) and (2,7), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (5,1)=3. It has three bombs around it. The surrounding squares are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,0)=1, (5,2) is unexplored, (6,0) is unexplored, (6,1) is unexplored, (6,2) is unexplored. So maybe some of these are bombs, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, looking at (4,7)=1. It has one bomb adjacent. The surrounding squares are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (3,6)=1, (3,7)=2, (4,6) is empty, (4,8)=1, (5,6) is unexplored, (5,7) is unexplored, (5,8) is unexplored. So the bomb adjacent to (4,7) must be one of these. But since (4,7) is 1, there's exactly one bomb around it.\n\nLooking at (4,7), maybe the bomb is at (5,6) because (5,6) is near other numbers. Or perhaps (3,6)=1 is pointing to a bomb nearby. But (3,6) is 1, so it has one bomb around it. The surrounding squares are (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). (2,5)=3, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (2,6) is unexplored, (2,7) is unexplored, (3,5)=1, which is a number, (3,7)=2, which is a number, (4,5) is empty, (4,6) is empty, (4,7)=1. So the bomb for (3,6)=1 must be either (2,6) or (2,7). But (2,5)=3 is adjacent to (2,6) and (2,7), so maybe those are bombs.\n\nWait, (2,5)=3, so it has three bombs around it. The surrounding squares are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). (2,4)=2, which is a number, so not a bomb. (3,5)=1, which is a number. (3,6)=1, which is a number. So the bombs must be in (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6). But (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) are all unexplored, and (2,6) is unexplored. So maybe (2,6) is a bomb, which would satisfy both (2,5)=3 and (3,6)=1.\n\nIf I consider (2,6) as a bomb, then (2,5)=3 would have two more bombs to account for. The other possible bombs would be in (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). But that's three squares, and I only need two more bombs. Alternatively, maybe (2,6) is a bomb, and one more from (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, making it a likely candidate for a bomb.\n\nLooking at (5,3)=2. It's adjacent to (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,2)=1, (4,3)=1, (5,2) is unexplored, (5,4) is empty, (6,2) is unexplored, (6,3)=2, (6,4)=1. So the two bombs around (5,3) must be in these squares.\n\nBut again, without more info, it's hard to tell. Maybe I should try to find a square that is adjacent to a number that can't have any more bombs, thus making it a likely bomb.\n\nLooking at (6,3)=2. It has two bombs around it. The surrounding squares are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,3)=2, which is a number, (5,4) is empty, (6,2) is unexplored, (6,4)=1, (7,2) is unexplored, (7,3) is unexplored, (7,4) is empty. So the bombs must be in (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (8,6)=1. It has one bomb around it. The surrounding squares are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). (7,6)=1, which is a number, (8,5)=1, (8,7) is empty, (9,5) is unexplored, (9,6) is unexplored, (9,7) is unexplored. So the bomb must be in one of these, but it's unclear.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, making it a prime candidate. For example, if a square is next to two numbers that both require it to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (2,6), it's adjacent to (2,5)=3 and (3,6)=1. If (2,6) is a bomb, then (2,5) would have one bomb accounted for, leaving two more to find around it. (3,6) would have its one bomb accounted for. That seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider (2,6) as a bomb, then (2,5) still needs two more bombs around it. So maybe (1,5) and (1,6) are bombs, but that would make (2,5) have three bombs, which is correct. But I don't know yet.\n\nAnother approach is to look for a square that is the only possible location for a bomb based on the numbers. For example, if a number 1 is next to only one unexplored square, that square must be the bomb.\n\nLooking at (4,7)=1. It has one bomb around it. The surrounding squares are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (3,6)=1, which is a number, so not a bomb. (3,7)=2, which is a number. (3,8) is empty. (4,6) is empty, (4,8)=1, which is a number. (5,6) is unexplored, (5,7) is unexplored, (5,8) is unexplored. So the bomb must be in (5,6), (5,7), or (5,8). But I can't determine which one yet.\n\nLooking at (5,7), which is unexplored, but (5,7) is adjacent to (5,6), which is also unexplored. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe I should consider placing a flag where it's most likely to be a bomb based on the numbers. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that could give me more information.\n\nFor example, revealing (2,6) would tell me if it's a bomb or not. If it's a bomb, then (2,5)=3 would have one bomb accounted for, and I can look for the other two. If it's not a bomb, then the bombs must be elsewhere.\n\nBut revealing a square could also be risky because if it's a bomb, the game ends. So maybe it's safer to flag a square that is likely a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a square that is adjacent to a number that can't have any more bombs, thus making it a must-flag.\n\nWait, looking at (3,7)=2. It has two bombs around it. The surrounding squares are (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). (3,6)=1, which is a number, so not a bomb. (4,7)=1, which is a number. So the bombs must be in (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8). But (2,6) is also adjacent to (2,5)=3, which needs three bombs. So if (2,6) is a bomb, that helps both (2,5) and (3,7).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should flag (2,6) because it's adjacent to two numbers that could use it as a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that is only adjacent to one number, making it a good candidate for a flag.\n\nLooking at (5,3)=2. It's adjacent to (4,2)=1 and (4,3)=1. If I flag (5,3), does that help? Wait, (5,3) is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, no. (5,3) is a 2, so it's a safe square indicating two bombs around it. So I can't flag it.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to find a square that is adjacent to a number that can only have one possibility.\n\nLooking at (9,3)=1. It's in the bottom row. The surrounding squares are (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4). (8,3)=1, which is a number, so not a bomb. (8,4)=1, which is a number. (8,2) is unexplored, (9,2) is unexplored, (9,4) is unexplored. So the bomb must be in one of these, but I can't tell which.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (7,6)=1. It's in the middle. The surrounding squares are (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). (6,6)=1, which is a number. (8,6)=1, which is a number. So the bomb must be in (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7). Not helpful.\n\nMaybe I should try to find a square that is adjacent to two numbers that both require it to be a bomb. For example, if a square is next to a 1 and a 2, and it's the only possible bomb for both, then it must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (2,6), it's adjacent to (2,5)=3 and (3,6)=1. If (2,6) is a bomb, then (2,5) would have one bomb accounted for, needing two more. (3,6) would have its one bomb accounted for. So that seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (2,6) is not a bomb, and the bombs are elsewhere. But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach is to look for a square that is surrounded by numbers that can't have any more bombs, making it a must-reveal. But I don't see any such squares right now.\n\nWait, looking at (5,1)=3. It's adjacent to (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,0)=1. So the bombs must be in (4,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). But (5,1)=3 needs three bombs, so three of these must be bombs. But I don't know which ones.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should take a guess based on the most likely candidate. Since (2,6) is adjacent to two numbers that could use it as a bomb, I'll consider placing a flag there.\n\nBut wait, I can't flag a square that's a number. (2,6) is unexplored, so it's a '.' which means it's unexplored, so I can flag it. But I have to make sure that placing a flag there doesn't conflict with any numbers.\n\nIf I flag (2,6), then (2,5)=3 would have one bomb accounted for, needing two more. (3,6)=1 would have its one bomb accounted for. So that seems okay.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal (2,6) to check if it's a bomb. If it's not, then I can look elsewhere. But revealing could end the game if it's a bomb.\n\nSince I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs, I can afford to flag (2,6) if I think it's a bomb. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe I should flag a different square.\n\nWait, looking at (5,6). It's unexplored and adjacent to (5,5), which is empty, and (5,7), which is unexplored. Not much info.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (6,3)=2. It's adjacent to (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,3)=2, which is a number, so not a bomb. (6,4)=1, which is a number. So the bombs must be in (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). But I don't know.\n\nI think I'll go with flagging (2,6) because it's adjacent to two numbers that could use it as a bomb. So I'll place a flag there.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (2,6) because it is adjacent to both (2,5)=3 and (3,6)=1, suggesting it could be a bomb that satisfies both numbers.\nMOVE: 2,6,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 1 1 1 1 2 3 . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 . .\n4 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1\n5 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 2 1 1 1 _ _ _\n7 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _\n9 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think><think><think><think><think><think> in the board state, I see that in row 2, column 5 is an F. That probably indicates a flag was placed there, which is okay because the board has 9 flags remaining and 10 bombs. Wait, the number of bombs is 10, so the flags can be up to 10, but only 9 are remaining. Hmm.\n\nBut looking at the board, I notice that in row 3, column 5 is a 1. That might mean that there's a bomb adjacent to that square. So if I place a flag at (2,5), is that allowed? Let me check the rules. Rule 1 says each number must have exactly the number of bombs adjacent. So the square (2,5) has a 1, meaning exactly one adjacent bomb. But if I place a flag there, is that conflicting? Because the square (2,5) is F, which is a flag, but the number indicates one adjacent bomb. So maybe placing a flag there is allowed because the number is correct.\n\nWait, but the square (2,5) is F, which is a flag, but the square (3,5) is 1, meaning it has one adjacent bomb. So maybe the flag at (2,5) is okay as long as the number at (3,5) is correct. But if I place a flag at (2,5), would that interfere with the numbers? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal square (2,5) to check if it's a bomb. But since it's marked as F, that might be a game over if it's a bomb. Wait, no, because if I reveal a square that's a bomb, it's game over. So maybe I shouldn't reveal it yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place the flag somewhere else. Let me check other squares. For example, row 4, column 5 is 1. That might be a good place to put a flag because it's adjacent to a 1, which is okay. Or maybe row 5, column 5 is 3. That might be a good spot because it's adjacent to three bombs, which could be correct.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a square where the number matches the possible flags. For example, row 2 column 4 is 2, which is adjacent to two bombs. So placing a flag there might be okay because the number is 2, which would require exactly two bombs adjacent. But is that square already flagged? Let me check the board state.\n\nLooking back, the board has several F's, like (0,0) is F, (0,1) is F, etc. So maybe I can place a flag at (2,5) as it's currently F. But I'm concerned about the adjacent numbers. Maybe I should reveal a square instead.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of flags I have left. I have 9 flags remaining, and I know there are 10 bombs in total. So I need to place one more flag. Maybe I should place it at (2,5), but that square is already F, which might be a flag. Wait, no, F indicates a flag, so (2,5) is F, so placing a flag there would be redundant. So maybe I should place the flag elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I should check how many bombs are around each potential flag spot. For example, row 2 has several numbers: at (2,0) it's 1, (2,1) is 1, (2,2) is 1, (2,3) is 1, (2,4) is 2, (2,5) is 3, (2,6) is F, (2,7) is 2, (2,8) is 3, (2,9) is F. So row 2 has multiple numbers indicating adjacent bombs.\n\nIf I look at column 5, the squares are: (0,5) is ., (1,5) is ., (2,5) is F, (3,5) is 1, (4,5) is 1, (5,5) is 3, (6,5) is 2, (7,5) is ., (8,5) is ., (9,5) is .. So only (2,5) is F, others are either . or numbers. So maybe I should avoid placing a flag in column 5 except at (2,5). But (2,5) is F, so placing a flag there would be correct because it's already flagged.\n\nWait, no, F is a flag, so placing another flag there would be incorrect. So maybe I should look elsewhere. Perhaps column 0 has several F's: (0,0), (1,0), etc. So placing a flag at (0,0) is already F, so that's okay. But I have 9 flags left, so maybe I can place one at (0,0) as it's already F. Wait, but (0,0) is F, so I can't place another flag there. So maybe I should look for a square that's not yet flagged.\n\nLooking at row 0, columns 0-9: all are either . or F. So I can't place a flag in row 0. Row 1 has F at (1,0). So maybe I can place a flag at (1,1) or somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that's currently . and has a number that matches the number of bombs adjacent. For example, (3,5) is 1, so if I place a flag there, it should have exactly one adjacent bomb. But I need to check if that's possible.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should just reveal a square instead of placing a flag. For example, revealing (2,5) would show whether it's a bomb or not. If it's a bomb, game over. If it's not, then I can place a flag elsewhere.\n\nBut since (2,5) is F, which is a flag, revealing it would cause a game over because it's a bomb. Wait no, F is a flag, so if (2,5) is a bomb, then revealing it would be game over. But I don't know if it's a bomb yet. So maybe I should reveal it to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere else where the numbers indicate the correct number of adjacent bombs. For example, if I place a flag at (4,5), which is currently 1, that might be okay because it's adjacent to one bomb. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square where the number matches the number of flags I have left. Since I have 9 flags, and the board has 10 bombs, I need to ensure that each flag I place doesn't conflict with the numbers.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should take a step back. The initial board has several F's, and I have 9 flags left. I need to place one more flag. I should choose a square that's currently . and has a number indicating the correct number of adjacent bombs. For example, if I place a flag at (3,5), which is 1, then it needs exactly one adjacent bomb. But I don't know if that's true.\n\nAlternatively, placing a flag at (5,5), which is 3, would require that there are exactly three adjacent bombs. That seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, placing a flag at (6,5), which is 2, would require exactly two adjacent bombs. That also seems possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure which one to choose. Maybe I should prioritize based on the numbers. Since I have 9 flags and 10 bombs, I can afford to place flags where the numbers indicate the correct number of adjacent bombs. So perhaps I should place a flag at (5,5), which is 3, as that would require three adjacent bombs, which is feasible since the total bombs are 10.\n\nBut wait, the board has 10 bombs, so if I place a flag at (5,5), which is 3, that would mean there are three bombs around it. But I don't know where those bombs are. Maybe it's better to place the flag where the number matches the number of flags I have. Since I have 9 flags, maybe I should place the flag where the number is 9. But looking at the board, I don't see any square with 9. The highest number I see is 3 at (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place the flag at (4,5), which is currently 1, indicating five adjacent bombs. Wait, no, (4,5) is 1, meaning one adjacent bomb. That might be a good spot because placing a flag there would require exactly one bomb adjacent, which is manageable.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should just make a move. Let's say I decide to place a flag at (5,5), which is 3. So I'll do that.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,flag=true\n\nBut wait, (5,5) is currently 3, which would require exactly three adjacent bombs. Since the total bombs are 10, placing a flag there would be okay because 3 \u2264 10. But I need to ensure that the adjacent bombs are correctly numbered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square instead. Let's say I reveal (2,5) to see if it's a bomb. If it's a bomb, game over. If not, I can place a flag elsewhere.\n\nBut since (2,5) is F, which is a flag, revealing it would show whether it's a bomb or not. If it's a bomb, game over. So maybe that's a risk I should take.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a different square. Let's say I reveal (3,5), which is 1. If it's a bomb, then I lose. If not, I can place a flag.\n\nBut I don't know. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a square that's . and has a number that matches the number of flags I have. Since I have 9 flags, maybe I should find a square with 9 adjacent bombs, but I don't see any such square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place the flag at (9,9), but that's the bottom-right corner. Let me check the board state. The board goes up to row 9, column 9. So (9,9) is the bottom-right. Looking at the board, (9,9) is ., so it's unexplored. The number at (9,9) is ., which is unexplored. So maybe placing a flag there would be okay because it's in the corner, but I don't know if that's a good spot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just place the flag at (2,5) since it's already F, which is a flag. So I can place another flag there, but that might be redundant. Or maybe not, since F is already a flag, so placing another flag there would be invalid.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should just make a move. Let's say I place a flag at (5,5), which is 3. So MOVE: 5,5,flag=true.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should explain why I chose that move. Well, considering the board, I need to place a flag where the number matches the number of adjacent bombs. Since I have 9 flags left, I should find a square where the number is 9, but I don't see any. Alternatively, since the square (5,5) is 3, which is less than 9, but I have more flags than bombs, so it's okay.\n\nI think I've thought enough. I'll provide the move as placing a flag at (5,5). So MOVE: 5,5,flag=true.\n\nBut wait, the square (5,5) is 3. So if I place a flag there, it should have exactly three adjacent bombs. Since the total bombs are 10, that's acceptable because 3 \u2264 10. So it's allowed.\n\nI think that's the best I can do.\n</think>\n\nTo place a flag at position (5,5), which currently shows a 3, indicating three adjacent bombs. This move is valid because the number 3 matches the number of bombs adjacent to the square (5,5), and since we have enough flags remaining, it's a suitable spot.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,flag=true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 1 1 1 1 2 3 F . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 . .\n4 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1\n5 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 2 1 1 1 _ _ _\n7 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _\n9 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 4, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current board state and the game info provided. \n\nThe board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I've already placed 9 flags, so I have one more flag left to use. My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without hitting a bomb when revealing.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares are already revealed with numbers, some are flagged (like at position (2,6)), and others are still unexplored (marked with a '.'). My task is to decide whether to place another flag or reveal a tile, ensuring that I don't cause a conflict with the existing numbers and flags.\n\nFirst, I should check the revealed numbers against the existing flags to spot any obvious conflicts. For example, if a tile with a '1' has two adjacent flags, that's a problem because it can only have one bomb nearby. Similarly, a '2' with only one adjacent flag must have another bomb somewhere else nearby.\n\nLooking at the board, let's focus on the revealed numbers and their surroundings.\n\nStarting with row 2: The tile at (2,0) is a '1', which means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares. The tiles around it are mostly unexplored except for (2,1) which is also a '1'. Wait, no, looking again, row 2 has '1's at (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4). So that's five '1's in a row. That seems a bit odd because each '1' would need exactly one bomb in their adjacent squares. But since they are next to each other, the bombs must be arranged in a way that satisfies all these '1's.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again: row 2, columns 0-4 are '1's, then (2,5) is '2', (2,6) is 'F', and the rest are unexplored. So each of these '1's in row 2 must have exactly one bomb adjacent. But since they are all next to each other, the bombs must be placed in such a way that each '1' only has one bomb nearby.\n\nBut maybe I should look elsewhere for easier clues. Let's check row 3. The tile at (3,5) is '1', which means there's one bomb adjacent to it. The surrounding tiles are mostly unexplored except for (3,4) which is '_', (3,6) is '1', and (4,5) is '_'. So the bomb adjacent to (3,5) could be in one of the surrounding unexplored tiles.\n\nLooking at row 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) are '1's, and (4,4) is '_', (4,5) is '_', (4,6) is '_', (4,7) is '1', (4,8) is '1', (4,9) is '1'. So each of these '1's must have exactly one bomb adjacent. For example, (4,7) is '1', so there's one bomb around it. The surrounding tiles include (3,6) which is '1', (3,7) which is '2', (4,6) which is '_', (4,8) which is '1', (5,6) which is '_', and (5,7) which is '_'. So the bomb for (4,7) must be in one of these.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for tiles that have numbers which can only be satisfied by a certain tile being a bomb. For example, if a '1' is next to only one unexplored tile, that tile must be the bomb.\n\nLooking at (2,6), which is flagged as 'F'. So that's a potential bomb. Let's see if that makes sense with the surrounding numbers. The tile at (2,5) is '2', which means it has two bombs adjacent. If (2,6) is a bomb, then the other bomb must be somewhere else around (2,5). The surrounding tiles of (2,5) are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). Since (2,6) is a flag, that counts as one bomb. So the other bomb must be in one of the other surrounding tiles. Let's check if any of those are numbers that could indicate that.\n\nLooking at (3,5) which is '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (2,6) is a bomb, then (3,5) would have that as one bomb, but it can't have any others. So the other bomb for (2,5) must be somewhere else, not adjacent to (3,5). Maybe (1,5) or (3,4) or (3,6). But (3,6) is '1', so if (3,6) is '1', it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (2,6) is a bomb, then (3,6) already has one bomb, so the other bomb for (2,5) can't be adjacent to (3,6). So perhaps the other bomb is at (1,5) or (3,4).\n\nWait, but (3,4) is '_', so it's unexplored. If I could determine if that's a bomb or not, it would help. Alternatively, maybe I should look for other tiles that can give me more information.\n\nLooking at row 5: (5,0) is '1', (5,1) is '3', (5,2) is '_', (5,3) is '2', and so on. The '3' at (5,1) indicates three bombs adjacent. The surrounding tiles are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). Since (5,0) is '1', it already has one bomb, so the other two bombs for (5,1) must be among the other surrounding tiles. But I'm not sure which ones yet.\n\nLooking at row 6: (6,3) is '2', (6,4) is '1', (6,5) is '1', and (6,6) is '1'. Each of these '1's must have exactly one bomb adjacent. For example, (6,4) is '1', so the bomb must be in one of the surrounding tiles: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But (6,3) is '2', so it has two bombs adjacent. So perhaps the bomb for (6,4) is at (5,3) or (7,3) or (7,4), etc.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should focus on tiles that are more constrained. Let's look at row 8: (8,3) is '1', (8,4) is '1', (8,5) is '1', (8,6) is '1', and (8,7) is '_'. Each of these '1's must have exactly one bomb adjacent. For example, (8,3) is '1', so the bomb must be in one of the surrounding tiles: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). Similarly for the others.\n\nLooking at row 9: (9,3) is '1', so the bomb must be adjacent to it. The surrounding tiles are (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4). So if (9,3) is '1', it needs exactly one bomb in those tiles.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a situation where a number has only one possible tile left to be a bomb. For example, if a '1' is surrounded by mostly revealed tiles except one, that one must be the bomb.\n\nLooking at (3,6), which is '1'. The surrounding tiles are (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). (2,5) is '2', (2,6) is 'F', (3,5) is '1', (4,5) is '_', (4,6) is '_', (4,7) is '1', etc. Since (3,6) is '1', it needs exactly one bomb. (2,6) is already a flag, so that's one bomb. Therefore, none of the other surrounding tiles can be bombs. So (2,7), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), etc., can't be bombs because (3,6) already has one bomb at (2,6). That's helpful.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (4,7), which is '1'. The surrounding tiles include (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). Since (4,7) is '1', it needs exactly one bomb. If (3,6) is '1' and (2,6) is a flag, then (4,7) can't have a bomb at (3,6). So the bomb must be somewhere else, maybe (5,7) or (5,8), etc.\n\nWait, but (5,7) is '_', so it's unexplored. Maybe I can't determine that yet.\n\nLet me go back to row 2. The tile at (2,5) is '2', so it needs two bombs adjacent. Since (2,6) is a flag, that's one bomb. So the other bomb must be in one of the surrounding tiles. The surrounding tiles are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). (2,4) is '1', (3,5) is '1', (3,6) is '1'. So if (2,5) needs two bombs, and one is at (2,6), the other must be in one of the other surrounding tiles. But all the other surrounding tiles are '1's, which can only have one bomb each. So that suggests that one of those '1's must have their bomb at (2,5)'s other bomb. Wait, that might not make sense because the '1's can only have one bomb each, so if (2,5) has another bomb, it must be in a tile that is adjacent to one of the '1's.\n\nWait, maybe (3,5) is '1', so it has one bomb. If (3,5) is adjacent to (2,5), then (2,5) could be a bomb, but (2,5) is '2', not a bomb. So (3,5)'s bomb must be elsewhere. So the other bomb for (2,5) must be in a tile that is adjacent to both (2,5) and another '1'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other bomb is at (1,5), which is unexplored. If I could determine if (1,5) is a bomb, that would help. But I don't have enough info yet.\n\nAnother approach: since I have one flag left, I need to decide where to place it. I should look for a tile that is likely to be a bomb based on the numbers around it.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 3 is '2', which means it has two bombs adjacent. The surrounding tiles are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,3) is '1', (6,3) is '2', (5,4) is '_', etc. So the two bombs must be in two of these tiles. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 3 is '2', so it needs two bombs. The surrounding tiles include (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,3) is '2', (6,4) is '1', etc. Again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the total number of bombs. There are 10 bombs in total, and I've already placed 9 flags. So there's one bomb left to flag. So I need to find where that last bomb is.\n\nLooking at the board, I can try to count how many bombs are already flagged. There's one flag at (2,6). So that's one bomb. Therefore, there are 9 bombs left, but I can only place one more flag. Wait, no: the game info says \"Bombs: 10\", and \"Flags remaining: 9\". Wait, that might mean that there are 10 bombs on the board, and I can place up to 10 flags, but I've used 1 so far (since flags remaining is 9). Wait, no: the \"Flags remaining\" is how many more flags I can place. So if \"Flags remaining\" is 9, that means I can place 9 more flags, but I've already placed 1 (at (2,6)), so total flags placed would be 10 when I place the 9th. Wait, no, the initial flags remaining is 10, I think. Wait, the game info says \"Flags remaining: 9\", so I have 9 flags left to place. But there are 10 bombs, so I need to place 10 flags in total, meaning I've placed 1 so far (since 10 - 9 = 1). So I can place 9 more flags. Wait, no, the \"Flags remaining\" is how many more I can place. So if it's 9, I can place 9 more. So I have placed 1 flag, and I can place 9 more, but I only need to flag 10 bombs. So perhaps I have 9 flags left to place, but I need to place 9 more because I've already placed 1. So total flags will be 10 when I place the 9 remaining.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that I have 9 flags left to place, and there are 10 bombs in total. So I can place all 10 bombs as flags, but I have to be careful not to place a flag on a non-bomb tile.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on the board and see if I can find a tile that must be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 2, columns 0-4 are all '1's. Each of these must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since they are all in a row, the bombs must be arranged in a way that each '1' has exactly one bomb in their adjacent tiles.\n\nLooking at (2,0): it's a '1', so the bomb must be in one of the surrounding tiles: (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). But (2,1) is also a '1', so the bomb can't be at (2,1). So the bomb for (2,0) must be at (1,0), (1,1), (3,0), or (3,1). Similarly, (2,1) is a '1', so its bomb must be in (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). But (2,0) and (2,1) are both '1's, so they can't share a bomb unless it's in a tile that's adjacent to both. For example, if there's a bomb at (1,1), that would satisfy both (2,0) and (2,1). Similarly, a bomb at (3,1) would also satisfy both.\n\nBut if (2,0) and (2,1) both have a bomb at (1,1), that would mean (1,1) is a bomb, which would satisfy both '1's. But then, looking at (2,2), which is also a '1', it would need a bomb in its surrounding tiles. If (1,1) is a bomb, then (2,2) could have its bomb at (1,2) or (3,2), etc.\n\nThis seems a bit tangled, but perhaps I can find a pattern. If all the '1's in row 2 are adjacent to a single column in row 1 or row 3, that might explain it. For example, if there are bombs in row 1, columns 0-4, but that would be too many bombs. Alternatively, perhaps the bombs are in row 3, columns 0-4, but that would also be too many.\n\nWait, perhaps the bombs are in row 1, columns 0-4, but that would mean 5 bombs, which is too many since there are only 10 bombs in total. Alternatively, perhaps the bombs are placed in a staggered manner.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the '1's in row 2 must each have exactly one bomb adjacent, but since they are all in a row, the bombs must be arranged in a way that each '1' has a bomb either above or below. But since row 2 is in the middle, perhaps the bombs are in row 1 or row 3.\n\nBut looking at row 3, the tiles at (3,0) to (3,4) are '_', so they are revealed but empty. That means there are no bombs in row 3, columns 0-4 because if there were, the '1's in row 2 would have already accounted for them. Wait, no, because row 3's tiles are '_', meaning they are safe, so no bombs there. Therefore, the bombs adjacent to row 2's '1's must be in row 1 or row 2 or row 4.\n\nWait, row 3's tiles are '_', so they are safe. So the bombs adjacent to row 2's '1's must be in row 1 or row 4. But row 4 has some '1's as well, so that complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the bombs are in row 1, columns 0-4. But that would mean 5 bombs, which is possible, but let's check.\n\nIf (1,0) is a bomb, then (2,0) is '1', which is correct. Similarly, (1,1) is a bomb, then (2,1) is '1', and so on. But that would require 5 bombs in row 1, which is possible. But let's see if that conflicts with other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 0: all tiles are '.', so unexplored. If row 1 has bombs at columns 0-4, then row 0's tiles would have numbers indicating adjacent bombs. For example, (0,0) would be adjacent to (1,0), which is a bomb, so (0,0) would be '1'. But (0,0) is '.', so it's unexplored. So that's possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look elsewhere for more clues.\n\nLooking at (5,1), which is '3'. The surrounding tiles are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (5,0) is '1', (4,1) is '1', (6,1) is '.', etc. So the three bombs must be in three of these tiles. Since (5,0) is '1', it already has one bomb, so the other two bombs must be in the remaining tiles.\n\nWait, but (5,0) is '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. Therefore, the three bombs for (5,1) must include the bomb that (5,0) is already accounting for, but that can't be because (5,0) is '1' and can only have one bomb. Therefore, (5,1)'s three bombs must be in the other surrounding tiles, not including (5,0)'s bomb. So the three bombs must be in (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). But (4,1) is '1', which can only have one bomb, so if (4,1) is '1', it must have one bomb adjacent, which could be one of the three needed for (5,1). Similarly, (5,2) is '_', so it could be a bomb.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a tile that is definitely a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at (3,6), which is '1'. The surrounding tiles include (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). Since (2,6) is a flag (a bomb), that's one bomb. So (3,6) can't have any other bombs adjacent. Therefore, none of the other surrounding tiles can be bombs. So (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7) can't be bombs. That's helpful.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (4,7), which is '1'. The surrounding tiles include (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). Since (3,6) is '1' and (2,6) is a bomb, (4,7) must have its bomb somewhere else. So the bomb must be in (5,7) or (5,8) or (4,8), etc. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at (5,3), which is '2'. The surrounding tiles are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,3) is '1', (6,3) is '2', (5,4) is '_', etc. So the two bombs must be in two of these tiles. Since (4,3) is '1', it can only have one bomb, so if (4,3) is adjacent to a bomb, that could be one of the two for (5,3).\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a tile that is adjacent to multiple numbers, making it a likely candidate for a bomb.\n\nLooking at (5,7), which is '_'. It's surrounded by (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (4,7) is '1', (5,6) is '_', (6,7) is '_', etc. If (5,7) is a bomb, then (4,7) would have its required bomb, which would satisfy its '1' count. Also, (5,6) is '_', which is adjacent to (5,7), so if (5,6) is a number, it would have to account for that bomb.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps (5,7) is a bomb, which would help both (4,7) and (5,3) if needed.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (6,3), which is '2'. The surrounding tiles are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,3) is '2', (6,4) is '1', etc. So the two bombs must be in two of these tiles.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a tile that is adjacent to two '1's, which would make it a likely bomb. For example, if a tile is adjacent to two '1's, it must be a bomb because each '1' needs exactly one bomb, and if they both point to the same tile, that's the bomb.\n\nLooking at (2,6), which is a flag. It's adjacent to (2,5) which is '2' and (3,5) which is '1', and (3,6) which is '1'. So that makes sense because (2,6) is a bomb, satisfying (2,5)'s need for two bombs (one at (2,6) and another somewhere else), and also satisfying (3,5) and (3,6)'s '1's.\n\nWait, no, (3,5) is '1', so it needs exactly one bomb. Since (2,6) is a bomb, (3,5) is adjacent to (2,6), so that's its one bomb. Therefore, (3,5) can't have any other bombs adjacent. So the other bomb for (2,5) must be somewhere else, not adjacent to (3,5).\n\nSo the other bomb for (2,5) must be in one of the other surrounding tiles: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (3,4), (3,6), (2,4). But (2,4) is '1', so if (2,4) is adjacent to a bomb, that would be its one bomb. So if (2,5)'s other bomb is at (1,5), then (2,4) would have its bomb at (1,4) or (3,4), etc.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to find a tile that is definitely a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nWait, looking at (8,3), which is '1'. The surrounding tiles are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). Since it's a '1', it needs exactly one bomb. If I could find a tile that is adjacent to multiple '1's, that might be the bomb.\n\nLooking at (9,3), which is '1'. The surrounding tiles are (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4). So if (9,3) is '1', it needs one bomb in these tiles. If (8,3) is also '1', it needs one bomb in its surrounding tiles, which include (9,3). So perhaps the bomb is at (9,4), which is adjacent to both (8,3) and (9,3). That would satisfy both '1's.\n\nSo if I place a flag at (9,4), that would satisfy both (8,3) and (9,3). Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf (9,4) is a bomb, then (8,3) is '1' because it's adjacent to (9,4). Similarly, (9,3) is '1' because it's adjacent to (9,4). That works. So placing a flag at (9,4) would be a good move because it satisfies both '1's.\n\nBut wait, I can only place one more flag because I have 9 flags remaining, but I've already placed one. Wait, no, the game info says \"Flags remaining: 9\", so I can place 9 more flags. But I need to flag 10 bombs in total, so I can place 9 more flags, meaning I can flag 9 more bombs. So placing a flag at (9,4) would be one of them.\n\nBut before I do that, I should check if placing a flag at (9,4) conflicts with any other numbers. Let's see.\n\nThe tile at (9,4) is surrounded by (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,3), (9,5). (8,3) is '1', (8,4) is '1', (9,3) is '1', and (9,5) is '_'. So if (9,4) is a bomb, then (8,3) and (9,3) each have their required bomb. (8,4) is '1', so it needs one bomb adjacent. If (8,4) is '1', and (9,4) is a bomb, that satisfies (8,4)'s requirement. So placing a flag at (9,4) would satisfy (8,3), (8,4), and (9,3). That seems correct.\n\nSo my next move would be to place a flag at (9,4). That way, I correctly flag a bomb, and it doesn't conflict with any of the existing numbers because it satisfies all the adjacent '1's.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider revealing a tile to get more information, but since I have flags remaining, it's safer to flag a tile that I'm confident is a bomb.\n\nSo, after analyzing, I think placing a flag at (9,4) is the best move because it satisfies multiple '1's around it without causing any conflicts.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (9,4) satisfies the '1's at (8,3), (8,4), and (9,3) without conflicting with other numbers, making it a confident move.\n\nMOVE: 9,4,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 1 1 1 1 2 3 F . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 . .\n4 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1\n5 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 2 1 1 1 _ _ _\n7 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _\n9 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 8, "y": 7, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, with 10 bombs total and 8 flags remaining. So, I can place 8 more flags if needed, but I have to be careful not to exceed the bomb count.\n\nLooking at the board, I see some numbers and flags already placed. Let me go through each revealed number and see if there are any obvious conflicts or places where I can deduce where the bombs are.\n\nStarting from the top, row 2 has some numbers: 1,1,1,1,2,3, and an F (flag) at (2,7). Wait, that's actually row 2, column 7. So, the flag is at (2,7). Let me check what numbers are around it.\n\nIn row 2, the numbers are at (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=3, and (2,6)=F, which is a flag. So, the flag is at (2,6)? Wait, the board shows F at (2,6), so that's a flag. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the board state is given as:\n\nRow 2: 1 1 1 1 2 3 F . . . . So, at (2,6) is F, which is a flag. So, that's a flag placed by the player. Now, I need to check if this flag is correctly placed or if it's causing a conflict.\n\nThe number at (2,5) is 3. That means there are 3 bombs adjacent to (2,5). The adjacent squares would be (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). Let's see which of these are revealed or flagged.\n\nLooking at the board, (2,6) is a flag, so that's one bomb accounted for. So, the number at (2,5)=3 would require two more bombs in the remaining adjacent squares. Let's see what's around (2,5).\n\nLooking at row 1, columns 4,5,6: row 1 is all dots except for (1,0) which is a dot. So, nothing revealed there. In row 3, columns 4,5,6: (3,4)=_, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2. So, (3,5) is 1, meaning it has one adjacent bomb. But (3,6) is 2, so two bombs adjacent.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me check each number and see if the flags are conflicting.\n\nAnother approach is to look for numbers that are 1, because they can only have one adjacent bomb, so if they already have a flag next to them, the other adjacent squares must be safe.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 5 is 1. So, (3,5)=1. That means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares. Let's see which squares are around (3,5):\n\n(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,4), (3,6).\n\nFrom the board, (2,6) is a flag, which is a bomb. So, that's one bomb. Therefore, the other squares around (3,5) must not have any bombs, because (3,5)=1. So, (2,4), (2,5), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,4), (3,6) should be safe. But wait, (3,6) is 2, which indicates two bombs adjacent. So, if (3,5)=1 has a bomb at (2,6), then the squares around (3,6)=2 must have two bombs, but one of them is already (2,6). So, there must be another bomb adjacent to (3,6). Let me check the surrounding squares of (3,6):\n\n(2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,5), (3,7).\n\nWe know (2,6) is a bomb. So, that's one. (2,5)=3, which is a number, so it's safe. (3,5)=1, which is also a number. So, the other bomb must be in (2,7), (4,5), (4,6), or (4,7). But (2,7) is a dot, so maybe it's a bomb. Or perhaps (4,5) or (4,6). Let me check row 4: (4,5)=_, (4,6)=_, (4,7)=1. So, (4,7)=1, which is a number.\n\nWait, (4,7)=1, so that square has one adjacent bomb. Let's see its adjacent squares:\n\n(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8).\n\nFrom these, (3,6)=2, which is a number, and (4,7)=1. So, the bomb adjacent to (4,7) could be (3,6) or (5,7), but (3,6) is a number, so it's safe. So, the bomb must be at (5,7). But (5,7) is a dot, so maybe that's a bomb.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me go back to row 3, column 6, which is 2. It needs two bombs adjacent. One is at (2,6). The other could be at (4,6) or (2,7). But (2,7) is a dot. Let me check if placing a flag at (2,7) would cause any conflicts.\n\nIf I flag (2,7) as a bomb, then let's see how it affects the surrounding numbers. The number at (2,5)=3 would have two bombs: (2,6) and (2,7), which would satisfy its count, but wait, (2,5)=3 needs three bombs. So, if (2,7) is a bomb, that would make two bombs adjacent to (2,5), but it needs three. So, that's a problem because (2,5) would then require another bomb, but where?\n\nAlternatively, maybe (2,7) is not a bomb, and the second bomb for (3,6)=2 is somewhere else.\n\nWait, let's check the number at (3,6)=2. It needs two bombs. One is at (2,6). The other could be at (4,6). So, if (4,6) is a bomb, then (3,6)=2 is satisfied. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 6 is currently _, so it's revealed but empty. Wait, no, (4,6) is _ in row 4, which is an empty revealed space. So, it's safe. Therefore, (4,6) can't be a bomb because it's already revealed as empty. So, that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe the second bomb is at (3,7). But (3,7) is a dot, so it's unexplored. Let me check what numbers are around (3,7). The number at (4,7)=1, which is adjacent to (3,7). So, if (3,7) is a bomb, then (4,7)=1 would be satisfied because it has one adjacent bomb. That could work.\n\nSo, if (3,7) is a bomb, then (3,6)=2 would have (2,6) and (3,7) as bombs, satisfying its count. Also, (4,7)=1 would have (3,7) as its one bomb, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, (3,7) is adjacent to (2,7), which is a dot. So, if (3,7) is a bomb, then (2,7) is adjacent to a bomb, so (2,7) would have a number indicating that. But (2,7) is currently a dot, so it's unexplored. So, if (2,7) is revealed, it should show a number. But since it's a dot, it's unexplored, so maybe it's a bomb or a number.\n\nBut let's think about the number at (3,5)=1. It has one bomb adjacent, which is (2,6). So, all other adjacent squares must be safe. Therefore, (3,7) can't be a bomb because it's adjacent to (3,5)=1, which would mean (3,5) has two bombs: (2,6) and (3,7). But (3,5) is 1, so that's a conflict. Therefore, (3,7) can't be a bomb because it would make (3,5) have two bombs, which contradicts (3,5)=1.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, if (3,5)=1 has a bomb at (2,6), then (3,7) can't be a bomb because that would add another bomb adjacent to (3,5). So, the second bomb for (3,6)=2 must be somewhere else.\n\nLet me check the other adjacent squares of (3,6)=2. The possible bombs could be at (4,5) or (4,6). But (4,5) is _, which is empty, so it can't be a bomb. (4,6) is also _, so it's empty. So, that can't be. Then where is the second bomb?\n\nWait, maybe (2,7) is the bomb. Let me check that. If (2,7) is a bomb, then (3,6)=2 would have two bombs: (2,6) and (2,7). That would satisfy it. But then, let's check the effect on (2,5)=3.\n\n(2,5)=3 needs three bombs. It's adjacent to (2,6)=F (bomb), (2,7)=bomb (if we place it), and what else? The other adjacent squares are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\n\n(2,4) is 2, which is a number, so safe. (3,4) is _, which is empty. (3,5)=1, which is a number. (3,6)=2, which is a number. So, the only bombs adjacent to (2,5) would be (2,6) and (2,7). That's two bombs, but (2,5) needs three. So, that's a problem. Therefore, (2,7) can't be a bomb because it would leave (2,5) with only two bombs, but it needs three.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for other numbers that can give me more clues.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 7 is 1. So, (4,7)=1. That means it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8).\n\nFrom these, (3,6)=2, which is a number. (4,6) is _, which is empty. (5,6) is 1, which is a number. (5,7) is _, which is empty. (5,8) is _, which is empty. So, the bomb must be in (3,7) or (3,8), or (5,7) or (5,8).\n\nBut (3,7) is adjacent to (3,5)=1, which already has a bomb at (2,6). If (3,7) were a bomb, (3,5) would have two bombs, which is impossible. So, (3,7) can't be a bomb. Similarly, (3,8) is a dot, so maybe that's a bomb. Let's check if that works.\n\nIf (3,8) is a bomb, then (4,7)=1 would have one bomb at (3,8). That works. Also, (3,6)=2 would have bombs at (2,6) and (3,8), which is two bombs. So that would satisfy (3,6)=2. But wait, (3,8) is a dot, so it's unexplored. If I place a flag there, would that cause any conflicts?\n\nLet me check the numbers around (3,8). The adjacent squares would be (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9).\n\n(2,8) is a dot, (2,9) is a dot. (3,7) is a dot, (3,9) is a dot. (4,7)=1, (4,8) is _, (4,9) is _.\n\nIf (3,8) is a bomb, then (4,7)=1 would have its one bomb, which is correct. Also, (4,8) is _, which is empty, so it's safe. But what about (2,8)? If (3,8) is a bomb, then (2,8) would be adjacent to a bomb, so (2,8) should be a number. But (2,8) is a dot, so it's unexplored. So, maybe (2,8) is a number, but we can't see it yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,7) is a bomb. Let me check that. If (5,7) is a bomb, then (4,7)=1 would have its one bomb, which is correct. Also, (5,7) is adjacent to (5,6)=1, which is a number. So, (5,6)=1 would have a bomb at (5,7), which is correct. But then, (3,6)=2 would need another bomb. If (5,7) is a bomb, does that help (3,6)=2? No, because (5,7) is not adjacent to (3,6). So, (3,6)=2 would still need another bomb.\n\nWait, (3,6) is at row 3, column 6. Its adjacent squares are (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). So, (5,7) is not adjacent to (3,6). Therefore, (3,6)=2 would still need another bomb. So, if (5,7) is a bomb, it doesn't help (3,6)=2.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for other clues elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 0 is 1. So, (5,0)=1. That means it has one adjacent bomb. The adjacent squares are (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1). From the board, (4,0) is _, (4,1)=1, (5,1) is 3, (6,0) is ., (6,1) is . So, (5,0)=1 needs one bomb in these squares.\n\nSince (4,1)=1 and (5,1)=3 are numbers, they are safe. So, the bomb must be at (4,0), (6,0), or (6,1). But (4,0) is _, which is empty, so it's safe. So, the bomb must be at (6,0) or (6,1). But (6,0) and (6,1) are dots, so unexplored. I can't determine much from here.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 3 is 2. So, (6,3)=2. That means two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4).\n\nFrom the board, (5,2)=., (5,3)=., (5,4)=2, (6,2)=., (6,4)=1, (7,2)=., (7,3)=., (7,4)=1.\n\nSo, (5,4)=2 and (6,4)=1 are numbers. (5,4)=2 needs two bombs. (6,4)=1 needs one bomb. Let me see if I can find where the bombs are.\n\nIf (6,4)=1 has one bomb, then the bomb must be in one of its adjacent squares: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5).\n\n(5,4)=2, which is a number, so it's safe. (5,3) is a dot. (5,5) is a dot. (6,3)=2, which is a number. (6,5) is a dot. (7,3) is a dot. (7,4)=1, which is a number. (7,5) is a dot.\n\nSo, the bomb adjacent to (6,4)=1 must be one of these. Let's say it's (5,3). If (5,3) is a bomb, then (5,4)=2 would have one bomb at (5,3). But (5,4)=2 needs two bombs, so another bomb must be adjacent. Maybe (5,5) is a bomb as well. Then, (5,4)=2 would have two bombs: (5,3) and (5,5). That could work.\n\nBut then, let's check if that affects other numbers. (6,3)=2 would have bombs at (5,3) and maybe (6,5) or (7,3). But (6,3)=2 needs two bombs. If (5,3) is a bomb, that's one. The other could be (6,5) or (7,3). But (6,5) is a dot, so maybe it's a bomb. But then (6,5) would also affect (6,4)=1, which already has one bomb. If (6,5) is a bomb, then (6,4)=1 would have two bombs: (5,3) and (6,5), which would make it 2, but it's 1. So that's a conflict. Therefore, (6,5) can't be a bomb.\n\nSo, if (5,3) is a bomb, then (6,3)=2 needs another bomb, which can't be (6,5). Maybe (7,3) is a bomb. Then, (6,3)=2 would have (5,3) and (7,3) as bombs, which is correct. Also, (7,3) would affect (7,4)=1, which already has one bomb. Wait, (7,4)=1 is adjacent to (7,3). If (7,3) is a bomb, then (7,4)=1 would have one bomb, which is correct. So, that could work.\n\nSo, in this scenario, (5,3) and (7,3) are bombs. Let's see if that causes any conflicts elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 1 is 3. So, (5,1)=3 needs three bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2).\n\nFrom the board, (4,1)=1, (5,0)=1, (6,1)=., (6,2)=., (5,2)=., (4,0)=_, (4,2)=1, (6,0)=.\n\nIf (5,3) is a bomb, does that affect (5,1)=3? No, because (5,3) is two columns away. So, the bombs adjacent to (5,1)=3 must be elsewhere.\n\nWait, (5,1)=3 needs three bombs in its adjacent squares. Let's see which could be bombs. (4,0) is _, which is empty. (4,1)=1 is a number. (4,2)=1 is a number. (5,0)=1 is a number. (5,2) is a dot. (6,0) is a dot. (6,1) is a dot. (6,2) is a dot.\n\nSo, the bombs must be at (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), or (6,2). But we have to have three bombs, which is a lot. Maybe (6,0), (6,1), and (6,2) are bombs. But that would make (6,0)=., (6,1)=., (6,2)=. as bombs, but that's three bombs, which would satisfy (5,1)=3. But let's see if that's possible.\n\nIf (6,0) is a bomb, then (5,0)=1 would have one bomb, which is correct. If (6,1) is a bomb, then (5,1)=3 would have one bomb. Similarly, (6,2) as a bomb would add another. So, that could work. But let's check if this causes any conflicts elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 0 is a dot. If it's a bomb, then (6,0) is a bomb. But (6,0) is adjacent to (5,0)=1, which is correct. Also, (6,1) is a dot, which would be a bomb, affecting (5,1)=3 and (6,1)'s adjacent squares. Similarly, (6,2) as a bomb would affect (5,2), which is a dot, and (6,2)'s adjacent squares.\n\nBut wait, if (6,0), (6,1), and (6,2) are bombs, that's three bombs in a row. Let's see if that's possible without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 0 is a dot. If (6,0) is a bomb, then (7,0) would be adjacent to a bomb, so (7,0) should be a number, but it's a dot. So, (7,0) is unexplored, which is fine because it's a dot. Similarly, (7,1) is a dot. If (6,1) is a bomb, then (7,1) would be adjacent to a bomb, so it should be a number. But (7,1) is a dot, so it's unexplored.\n\nThis seems possible, but I'm not sure if it's the right path. Maybe I should look for other clues.\n\nLooking back at row 2, column 6 is a flag. Let me check if that's correct. If (2,6) is a flag, then it's a bomb. Let me see if that causes any conflicts with the numbers around it.\n\nThe number at (2,5)=3 needs three bombs. The adjacent squares are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\n\n(2,6) is a bomb, so that's one. The other two must be in the remaining squares. Let's see which of these could be bombs.\n\n(1,4) is a dot, (1,5) is a dot, (1,6) is a dot, (2,4)=2, (3,4) is _, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2.\n\nSo, (2,4)=2 is a number, so it's safe. (3,5)=1 is a number, so it's safe. (3,6)=2 is a number, so it's safe. So, the bombs must be in (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), or (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) is _, which is empty. So, the bombs must be in (1,4), (1,5), or (1,6). Let's see if any of these can be bombs without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 1, columns 4,5,6 are all dots. So, if I place a bomb at (1,4), it would affect (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). But (2,4)=2 is a number, so it's safe. (2,5)=3 is a number, which would have one bomb at (2,6) and potentially another at (1,4). So, that could work.\n\nBut let's check if placing a flag at (1,4) would cause any conflicts. If I flag (1,4) as a bomb, then (2,4)=2 would have one bomb at (1,4). It needs two bombs, so another bomb must be adjacent. The adjacent squares to (2,4) are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).\n\n(1,4) is a bomb, (1,5) is a dot, (2,3)=1, (2,5)=3, (3,3) is _, (3,4) is _, (3,5)=1.\n\nSo, (2,4)=2 needs another bomb. The only possibilities are (1,5) or (3,4). But (3,4) is _, which is empty, so it can't be a bomb. So, (1,5) must be a bomb.\n\nIf (1,5) is a bomb, then (2,5)=3 would have two bombs: (1,5) and (2,6). It needs three, so another bomb must be adjacent. The only remaining square is (1,4), which we already considered, or (3,5). But (3,5)=1, which is a number, so it's safe. Therefore, (2,5)=3 would still need another bomb, but there's no other square available. So, that's a conflict.\n\nTherefore, (1,4) can't be a bomb because it would cause (2,4)=2 to require another bomb, which isn't possible without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nSimilarly, if I consider (1,5) as a bomb, let's see. If (1,5) is a bomb, then (2,5)=3 would have two bombs: (1,5) and (2,6). It needs three, so another bomb is needed. The only remaining square is (1,4) or (1,6). If (1,4) is a bomb, then (2,4)=2 would have two bombs: (1,4) and (1,5). But (2,4)=2 needs two bombs, which would be satisfied. But then, (2,5)=3 would have three bombs: (1,4), (1,5), and (2,6). That would work.\n\nWait, but (2,5)=3 would have three bombs: (1,4), (1,5), and (2,6). That would satisfy it. Also, (2,4)=2 would have two bombs: (1,4) and (1,5). That works too.\n\nBut let's check if placing flags at (1,4) and (1,5) would cause any other conflicts. Let's see the adjacent numbers.\n\n(1,4) as a bomb would affect (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (1,3) is a dot, (1,5) is a bomb, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=3.\n\n(2,3)=1 would have a bomb at (1,4), which is correct. (2,4)=2 would have bombs at (1,4) and (1,5), which is correct. (2,5)=3 would have bombs at (1,4), (1,5), and (2,6), which is correct.\n\nSo, this seems to fit without conflicts. Therefore, (1,4) and (1,5) could both be bombs, which would satisfy the numbers at (2,4)=2 and (2,5)=3.\n\nBut wait, the total number of bombs is 10. Let's see how many are already flagged. The board shows an F at (2,6) and (9,4). Wait, looking back at the board state, I see:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 F _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo, (9,4)=F, which is another flag. So, there are two flags already placed: (2,6) and (9,4). Therefore, with 8 flags remaining, we can place more.\n\nBut wait, the user said \"Flags remaining: 8\", which probably means that the player has 8 flags left to place, not that there are 8 flags on the board. So, the total bombs are 10, and the player can place up to 10 flags, but in this case, they have 8 remaining, so they've already placed 2 flags.\n\nSo, in this scenario, if I place flags at (1,4) and (1,5), that would add two more flags, but I need to check if that's allowed and if it doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nBut wait, the player can place flags on any unexplored squares, but they have to be careful not to exceed the total number of bombs. Since there are 10 bombs, and they've already placed 2 flags, they can place 8 more. So, placing two more here is possible.\n\nBut before placing any flags, I need to make sure that it doesn't conflict with the numbers. For example, if I place a flag at (1,4), I need to check if any adjacent numbers would be exceeded.\n\nLooking at (2,4)=2, which would have two bombs: (1,4) and (1,5). That's correct. (2,3)=1 would have one bomb at (1,4), which is correct. (2,5)=3 would have three bombs: (1,4), (1,5), and (2,6). That's correct.\n\nSo, placing flags at (1,4) and (1,5) seems to fit. But I can only place one flag per move. So, maybe I should choose one of them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for other squares where placing a flag would be more certain.\n\nLooking back at row 9, column 4 is a flag. So, (9,4)=F. Let's see if that's correct.\n\nThe number at (9,3)=1. So, (9,3)=1 needs one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4). But wait, the board is 10x10, so row indices go from 0 to 9. So, (10,x) doesn't exist. So, the adjacent squares are (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (8,5), (9,5), (8,6).\n\nWait, no, the adjacent squares for (9,3) would be:\n\n(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6). Wait, no, the adjacent squares are the eight surrounding squares:\n\n(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4). But since the board is 10x10, rows go up to 9, so (10,x) is out of bounds. So, the adjacent squares are (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (8,5), (9,5), (8,6).\n\nFrom the board, (9,4)=F, which is a bomb. So, (9,3)=1 has one bomb at (9,4). That's correct. So, the flag at (9,4) is correctly placed because it satisfies (9,3)=1.\n\nNow, looking at row 8, column 6 is 1. So, (8,6)=1. It needs one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7).\n\nFrom the board, (7,6)=1, (8,5)=1, (8,7)=1, (9,5)=., (9,6)=., (9,7)=., (7,5)=., (7,7)=.\n\nSo, the bomb must be in one of these squares. Let's see if any of these are already bombs or can be bombs.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 4 is a bomb. So, (9,4)=F. Does that affect (8,6)=1? No, because (9,4) is not adjacent to (8,6). So, the bomb adjacent to (8,6)=1 must be elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 6 is 1. So, (7,6)=1. It needs one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7).\n\nFrom the board, (6,5)=., (6,6)=1, (6,7)=., (7,5)=., (7,7)=., (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1, (8,7)=1.\n\nSo, the bomb must be in one of these squares. But (6,6)=1 is a number, so it's safe. (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1, (8,7)=1 are numbers. So, the bomb must be at (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), or (7,7).\n\nIf I consider placing a flag at (6,5), let's see. If (6,5) is a bomb, then (7,6)=1 would have one bomb, which is correct. Also, (8,6)=1 would have a bomb at (6,5)? No, because (6,5) is not adjacent to (8,6). Wait, (6,5) is adjacent to (7,5) and (7,6), but not directly to (8,6). So, (8,6)=1 would still need another bomb.\n\nAlternatively, if (7,5) is a bomb, then (7,6)=1 would have one bomb, which is correct. Also, (8,5)=1 would have a bomb at (7,5), which is correct. So, that could work.\n\nSo, placing a flag at (7,5) would satisfy both (7,6)=1 and (8,5)=1. Let me check if that causes any conflicts elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 5 is a dot, so it's unexplored. If I place a flag there, it would be a bomb. Let's see the adjacent squares:\n\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6).\n\n(6,4)=., (6,5)=., (6,6)=1, (7,4)=., (7,6)=1, (8,4)=., (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1.\n\nIf (7,5) is a bomb, then (6,5) would be adjacent to a bomb, so (6,5) should be a number, but it's a dot. So, (6,5) is unexplored, which is fine. Similarly, (6,4) is a dot, so it's unexplored.\n\nBut wait, (6,5) is adjacent to (7,5), so if (7,5) is a bomb, (6,5) should be a number. But (6,5) is a dot, so it's unexplored. So, that's possible, but it doesn't give us any new information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (6,7) is a bomb. If (6,7) is a bomb, then (7,6)=1 would have one bomb, which is correct. Also, (6,6)=1 would have a bomb at (6,7), which is correct. So, that could work.\n\nBut then, (8,6)=1 would still need a bomb. The bomb could be at (8,7), but (8,7) is a dot. Or (9,6), which is a dot. Or (7,7), which is a dot.\n\nIf (6,7) is a bomb, then (6,6)=1 would have one bomb, which is correct. (7,6)=1 would have one bomb, which is correct. (8,6)=1 would need a bomb, which could be at (8,7) or (9,6). But both are dots, so it's possible.\n\nBut I can only place one flag per move, so maybe I should choose the most certain one.\n\nLooking back at row 9, column 4 is a flag, which is correct. So, maybe I should look for other certain flags.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 0 is a dot. Let me see if it can be a bomb. The number at (8,1)=1, which is adjacent to (8,0). So, if (8,0) is a bomb, then (8,1)=1 would have one bomb, which is correct. Also, (7,0) is a dot, which would be adjacent to a bomb, so (7,0) should be a number, but it's a dot. So, (8,0) could be a bomb.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4 is 2. So, (5,4)=2 needs two bombs. The adjacent squares are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nFrom the board, (4,3)=., (4,4)=., (4,5)=., (5,3)=., (5,5)=., (6,3)=2, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=.\n\nSo, (6,3)=2 is a number, (6,4)=1 is a number. The bombs must be in the other squares. Let's see if any of these can be bombs without conflicting.\n\nIf (4,5) is a bomb, then (5,4)=2 would have one bomb. Another bomb must be in (5,3) or (5,5). But (5,3) is a dot, (5,5) is a dot. Alternatively, (4,3) could be a bomb.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Maybe I should look for a square where placing a flag would satisfy multiple numbers without causing conflicts.\n\nLooking back at row 3, column 5 is 1. It has a bomb at (2,6). So, all other adjacent squares must be safe. Therefore, (3,4) is _, which is empty, and (3,6)=2, which is a number.\n\nWait, (3,6)=2 needs two bombs. One is at (2,6). The other must be at (4,6) or (3,7). But (4,6) is _, which is empty, so it can't be a bomb. So, the other bomb must be at (3,7). But (3,7) is a dot, so it's unexplored.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that (3,7) can't be a bomb because it would affect (3,5)=1. Wait, (3,5)=1 has a bomb at (2,6). If (3,7) is a bomb, then (3,5)=1 would have two bombs, which is incorrect. Therefore, (3,7) can't be a bomb. So, where is the second bomb for (3,6)=2?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that (3,6)=2 has its second bomb at (4,5). Let me check. If (4,5) is a bomb, then (3,6)=2 would have two bombs: (2,6) and (4,5). That would satisfy it. Also, (4,5) is adjacent to (4,4)=1, which is a number. So, (4,4)=1 would have a bomb at (4,5), which is correct.\n\nBut (4,5) is a dot, so it's unexplored. If I place a flag there, it would be a bomb. Let me check if that causes any conflicts.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5 is a dot. If I place a flag there, it would be a bomb. Let's see the adjacent numbers:\n\n(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\n(3,4) is _, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,4)=1, (4,6)=_, (5,4)=2, (5,5)=., (5,6)=.\n\nSo, placing a bomb at (4,5) would mean:\n\n- (3,5)=1 would have a bomb at (2,6) and (4,5). But (3,5)=1 can only have one bomb, so that's a conflict. Therefore, (4,5) can't be a bomb because it would give (3,5)=1 two bombs, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, that's not possible. Therefore, the second bomb for (3,6)=2 must be elsewhere, but I can't find it. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that (3,6)=2 has its second bomb at (2,7). If (2,7) is a bomb, then (3,6)=2 would have two bombs: (2,6) and (2,7). That would satisfy it. But then, (2,5)=3 would have two bombs: (2,6) and (2,7), but it needs three. So, another bomb must be adjacent to (2,5). The only remaining square is (1,4) or (1,5). If I place a bomb at (1,4), then (2,5)=3 would have three bombs: (2,6), (2,7), and (1,4). That would work.\n\nBut as I considered earlier, placing a bomb at (1,4) would affect (2,4)=2, which would need another bomb. If (1,4) is a bomb, then (2,4)=2 would have one bomb, needing another. The only option is (1,5). So, placing bombs at (1,4) and (1,5) would satisfy both (2,4)=2 and (2,5)=3.\n\nSo, in this scenario, (2,7) is a bomb, (1,4) and (1,5) are bombs. That would give us a total of five bombs: (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (2,7), (9,4). But the total bombs are 10, so there are five more to place.\n\nBut I can only place one flag per move. So, maybe I should place a flag at (2,7) because it's needed for (3,6)=2 and (2,5)=3.\n\nBut wait, placing a flag at (2,7) would make (2,5)=3 have two bombs: (2,6) and (2,7). It still needs one more. So, I would have to place another flag elsewhere, but I can only do one per move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag at (1,5). Let's see.\n\nIf I place a flag at (1,5), then (2,5)=3 would have one bomb. It needs two more. The other bombs could be at (2,6) and (1,4). So, that would work, but I can only place one flag at a time.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a square where placing a flag would satisfy a number without causing conflicts.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 4 is already a flag. Let me check row 8, column 6 is 1. If I place a flag at (8,7), which is a dot, would that satisfy (8,6)=1? Let me see.\n\nIf (8,7) is a bomb, then (8,6)=1 would have one bomb, which is correct. Also, (7,6)=1 would have a bomb at (8,7), which is correct. So, placing a flag at (8,7) would satisfy both (8,6)=1 and (7,6)=1. That seems like a good move because it satisfies two numbers at once.\n\nBut I need to check if this causes any conflicts elsewhere. Let's see the adjacent squares to (8,7):\n\n(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8).\n\nFrom the board, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=., (7,8)=., (8,6)=1, (8,8)=., (9,6)=., (9,7)=., (9,8)=.\n\nSo, placing a flag at (8,7) would mean that (7,6)=1 and (8,6)=1 both have their required bombs. Also, (9,7) would be adjacent to a bomb, so it would be a number, but it's a dot, so it's unexplored.\n\nThis seems like a safe move because it doesn't conflict with any existing numbers. So, placing a flag at (8,7) would be a good move.\n\nTherefore, my next move would be to place a flag at (8,7).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (8,7) satisfies the adjacent numbers (8,6)=1 and (7,6)=1, each requiring exactly one bomb. This move doesn't conflict with other revealed numbers and uses one of the remaining flags.\n\nMOVE: 8,7,true", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 1 1 1 1 2 3 F . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 . .\n4 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1\n5 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 2 1 1 1 _ _ _\n7 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _\n9 . . . 1 F _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 7, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the information provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has 7 flags remaining, which means they can place 7 more flags if needed, but they have to be careful because each flag represents a potential bomb.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each of the revealed numbers and see if there are any obvious conflicts with the flags already placed. Starting from the top, row 2 has some numbers: 1,1,1,1,2,3, and an F (flag) at (2,7). Then row 3 has some underscores and numbers like 1,1,2. Row 4 has a 1, and some underscores, and so on.\n\nLooking at row 2, the flag is at (2,7). The number at (2,6) is 3, which means there are three bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent squares to (2,6) would be (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), and (3,7). But (2,7) is already a flag, so that counts as one bomb. So the remaining two bombs must be in the other seven squares. However, I don't see any other flags around (2,6), so maybe that's okay for now.\n\nNext, looking at row 8, there's a flag at (8,7). The number at (8,6) is 1, which means there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares would include (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), and (9,7). Since (8,7) is a flag, that accounts for the one bomb, so the rest should be safe. But I need to check if there are any other bombs around (8,6) that might conflict.\n\nLooking at row 5, there's a number 3 at (5,1). Its adjacent squares would include (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), and (6,2). There are some numbers there, like 1 at (5,2), which might help. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nI also notice that at (2,5), there's a 2, and (2,6) is a 3. So (2,5) has two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares for (2,5) are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). The flag is at (2,7), which is not adjacent to (2,5), so the two bombs must be among the other squares. Maybe (1,5) or (3,5) are bombs?\n\nWait, but (3,5) is a 1, so it can't have more than one bomb adjacent. So if (2,5) is 2, and (3,5) is 1, then one of the bombs must be adjacent to (3,5), which could be (2,5) itself, but that's a number, so it's safe. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLooking at row 4, there's a 1 at (4,1). Its adjacent squares would include (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), and (5,2). Since (4,1) is 1, there's exactly one bomb adjacent. But I don't see any flags around it, so maybe that's okay.\n\nI think I should check each number and see if the flags around it make sense. For example, at (2,6) which is 3, and there's a flag at (2,7). So that's one bomb. The other two bombs must be in the other adjacent squares. But I don't see any other flags nearby, so that might be okay.\n\nWait, but looking at (2,5) which is 2, and (2,6) is 3. So (2,5) has two bombs around it, and (2,6) has three. The flag at (2,7) is one, so (2,6) needs two more bombs in its adjacent squares. Maybe (1,5) or (3,5) could be bombs, but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at row 8 again, the flag at (8,7) is next to (8,6) which is 1. So that's good because (8,6) only needs one bomb, and the flag provides that. But I should check if there are other possible bombs around (8,6) that might conflict. For example, if (7,6) is a bomb, that would make (8,6) have two bombs, which contradicts the 1. So (7,6) must not be a bomb because (8,6) is 1 and already has the flag at (8,7).\n\nWait, but (7,6) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. So if (7,6) is 1, and it's adjacent to (8,6) which is 1, then maybe (7,6) has a bomb somewhere else. But I'm not sure.\n\nI think I should look for places where the numbers and flags might conflict. For example, if a square with a 1 has two flags around it, that's a conflict because the number can only have one bomb. Similarly, if a square with a 2 has only one flag, and no other possible bombs, that might be a problem.\n\nLooking at row 2, (2,0) is 1, and its adjacent squares are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). None of these are flags, so that's okay.\n\nWait, (2,0) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. But none of those are flags, so maybe one of them is a bomb. But I don't know which one yet.\n\nAnother approach is to count the number of bombs placed so far. There are two flags: at (2,7) and (8,7). Wait, no, looking back, the board shows F at (2,7) and (8,7). So that's two flags. The total bombs are 10, so there are 8 bombs left to place.\n\nBut the player has 7 flags remaining, which means they can place 7 more flags. So they need to be careful not to exceed the total number of bombs.\n\nWait, no, the flags remaining are 7, meaning they've already placed 3 flags because 10 total bombs minus 7 flags remaining equals 3 placed. Wait, no, the game info says flags remaining: 7, so the player can place 7 more. So total flags placed so far would be 10 - 7 = 3, but looking at the board, I only see two F's: at (2,7) and (8,7). So maybe I'm missing one. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the board, I see F at (2,7) and (8,7). So that's two flags. So the player has placed 2 flags, and has 7 remaining, meaning they can place 7 more. So total bombs are 10, so 8 bombs are still hidden.\n\nI think I need to find a square where placing a flag would not conflict with any numbers. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's safe based on the numbers around it.\n\nLooking at row 9, there's a flag at (9,7), but wait, no, looking at the board, row 9 is all dots except for (9,3) which is 1 and (9,7) which is F. Wait, no, the board shows:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 F _ _ _ _ _\n\nWait, (9,4) is F, not (9,7). So the flags are at (2,7), (8,7), and (9,4). So that's three flags, which matches the 10 bombs and 7 remaining flags (10-3=7).\n\nSo, the flags are at (2,7), (8,7), and (9,4). Now, I need to check if any of these flags conflict with the numbers.\n\nStarting with (2,7): it's adjacent to (2,6) which is 3. So (2,6) needs three bombs around it, and one is at (2,7). So the other two must be in the adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at (2,6)'s adjacent squares: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). (2,7) is a flag, so that's one. Now, (3,7) is a 2, so it must have two bombs around it. Let's see, (3,7) is adjacent to (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). (2,7) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So (3,7) needs one more bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at (3,7)'s adjacent squares, (2,8) is a dot, (3,8) is a dot, (4,7) is a 1, (4,8) is a 1. So maybe one of those is a bomb. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nMoving on, let's check (8,7). It's adjacent to (8,6) which is 1, so that's good because (8,6) only needs one bomb, which is provided by (8,7). Now, (8,7) is also adjacent to (7,6), which is a 1. So (7,6) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (8,7) is a flag, that's the one bomb, so (7,6) can't have any other bombs around it.\n\nLooking at (7,6)'s adjacent squares: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). (8,7) is a flag, so that's the one bomb. Therefore, all other squares around (7,6) must be safe. So (6,5), (6,6), etc., can't be bombs.\n\nNow, looking at (9,4), which is a flag. It's adjacent to (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,3), (9,5), (10,3), (10,4), (10,5). But wait, the board is 10x10, so row 9 is the last row, so (10,3) would be out of bounds. So the adjacent squares are (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,3), (9,5). (9,3) is a 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (9,4) is a flag, that's the one bomb, so (9,3) is satisfied.\n\nBut I need to check if (9,4) being a flag conflicts with any other numbers. For example, (8,4) is a 1 in row 8, column 4. So (8,4) is 1, and its adjacent squares include (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). (9,4) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So (8,4) is satisfied.\n\nNow, looking for any conflicts. For example, if a number has more flags around it than its value, that's a problem. Let's check each number.\n\nLooking at (2,5) which is 2. Its adjacent squares include (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). There are no flags around it except (2,7), which is not adjacent. So that's okay.\n\n(2,6) is 3, with one flag at (2,7). So it needs two more bombs. Maybe (1,5) and (3,5) are bombs.\n\n(3,5) is 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (3,5) is 1, and it's adjacent to (2,5) which is 2, and (4,5) which is _, then maybe one of its other adjacent squares is a bomb.\n\nWait, (3,5) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb around it. Its adjacent squares are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). So one of these must be a bomb.\n\nBut (2,5) is 2, so it's not a bomb. (2,6) is 3, also not a bomb. (4,5) is _, so maybe that's a bomb.\n\nIf (4,5) is a bomb, then (3,5)'s requirement is satisfied. Also, (4,5) being a bomb would help (2,6)'s count, as (2,6) needs three bombs. So (2,7) is one, (4,5) is another, so one more is needed.\n\nLooking at (2,6)'s adjacent squares, maybe (1,5) is the third bomb. If (1,5) is a bomb, then (2,5)'s count would be satisfied because (1,5) is adjacent to (2,5), making it two bombs: (1,5) and (4,5). Wait, no, (2,5) is 2, so it needs two bombs. If (1,5) and (4,5) are bombs, that would make two, which fits.\n\nBut I'm not sure if (1,5) is a bomb because it's still unexplored. Maybe I should look for other clues.\n\nLooking at row 5, (5,1) is 3. Its adjacent squares include (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (5,2) is 2, which is adjacent to (5,1). So (5,2) being 2 means it has two bombs around it. Let's see, its adjacent squares include (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (5,1) is 3, so it's not a bomb. So (5,2) needs two bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at (6,1) which is 1, it needs exactly one bomb around it. Its adjacent squares include (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2). (5,1) is 3, so not a bomb. So maybe (5,0) or (7,1) is a bomb.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a square that's safe to reveal based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at (0,0), it's unexplored. But that's probably not helpful. Let's look for a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, so revealing it might give more info.\n\nLooking at (3,7), which is 2. Its adjacent squares include (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). (2,7) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So (3,7) needs one more bomb. Maybe (4,7) is a bomb.\n\nIf (4,7) is a bomb, then (4,6) is 1, which is adjacent to (4,7). So (4,6) would have one bomb, which fits. Also, (3,7) would have two bombs: (2,7) and (4,7).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider placing a flag somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's definitely safe. For example, if a square is adjacent to a number that's already satisfied, it might be safe.\n\nLooking at (8,6) which is 1, and it's adjacent to (8,7) which is a flag. So (8,6) is satisfied. Therefore, all other adjacent squares to (8,6) must be safe except for (8,7). So the squares around (8,6) like (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) must be safe except for (8,7). Wait, but (8,7) is a flag, so it's a bomb. So the other squares around (8,6) must be safe.\n\nTherefore, (7,6) is a 1, which is okay because it's adjacent to (8,7). So (7,6) is safe because it only needs one bomb, which is provided by (8,7).\n\nSo maybe I can reveal (7,6) because it's safe. Wait, but (7,6) is a 1, so it's already revealed. So perhaps I can look at its adjacent squares.\n\nWait, no, (7,6) is a 1, so it's already revealed, and it's safe. So maybe I can reveal a square adjacent to it that's unexplored.\n\nLooking at (7,5), which is a dot. Since (7,6) is 1 and already has its bomb at (8,7), (7,5) must be safe. So revealing (7,5) would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere. Let me think.\n\nLooking at row 4, (4,5) is a dot. If I place a flag there, would that conflict with any numbers? Let's see, (4,5) is adjacent to (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). (3,5) is 1, so if (4,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy (3,5)'s requirement. Also, (4,5) being a bomb would help (2,6)'s count, as (2,6) needs three bombs, and (2,7) is one, (4,5) would be another, so one more is needed.\n\nBut I'm not sure if (4,5) is a bomb. Maybe I should check other squares.\n\nLooking at (5,3), which is a dot. It's adjacent to (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (5,2) is 2, so it needs two bombs. If (5,3) is a bomb, that would help (5,2)'s count, but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers to get more info.\n\nLooking at (6,6), which is a dot. It's adjacent to (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,6) is _, (6,5) is 1, (7,6) is 1. So maybe (6,6) is safe, but I'm not sure.\n\nI think the safest move might be to reveal a square that's adjacent to a number that's already satisfied. For example, since (8,6) is 1 and has its bomb at (8,7), all other adjacent squares must be safe. So revealing (7,5) or (8,5) might be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag where it's likely to be a bomb without conflicting with any numbers.\n\nLooking back at (2,6) which is 3, needing two more bombs. If I can find a square adjacent to it that's likely to be a bomb, I can place a flag there.\n\nLooking at (1,5), which is a dot. If (1,5) is a bomb, that would help (2,5)'s count as well, since (2,5) is 2. So (1,5) being a bomb would satisfy both (2,5) and (2,6)'s counts.\n\nBut I don't know if (1,5) is a bomb. Maybe I should check if placing a flag there would conflict with any numbers.\n\nLooking at (1,5)'s adjacent squares: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). (2,5) is 2, (2,6) is 3. If (1,5) is a bomb, then (2,5)'s count would be satisfied with (1,5) and another bomb, and (2,6) would have (1,5) and (2,7) as two bombs, needing one more.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should reveal (1,5) instead of flagging it, but that's risky because if it's a bomb, the game ends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a number that's already met its requirement, making the square safe.\n\nLooking at (9,5), which is a dot. It's adjacent to (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6). But since the board is 10x10, (10,4) is out of bounds. (8,4) is 1, which is satisfied by (9,4). So (9,5) is adjacent to (9,4), which is a flag, but (8,4) is 1, which is satisfied. So maybe (9,5) is safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should flag a square that's likely to be a bomb without conflicting numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal (4,5) to see if it's a bomb or not. If it's a bomb, that helps (2,6)'s count. If it's not, then I have to look elsewhere.\n\nBut revealing a square could be risky if it's a bomb. So maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a number that's already met its requirement.\n\nWait, (8,6) is 1 and has its bomb at (8,7), so all other adjacent squares must be safe. So (7,5) is adjacent to (8,6), which is 1, so (7,5) must be safe because (8,6) only has one bomb at (8,7). Therefore, revealing (7,5) is safe.\n\nSo maybe I should reveal (7,5). That would give me more information about the surrounding squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag at (4,5) because it might be a bomb, and it doesn't conflict with any numbers yet.\n\nBut I'm not sure. I think revealing (7,5) is safer because it's likely to be safe, and it will help me see more of the board.\n\nSo, the next move would be to reveal (7,5), which is safe because (8,6) is 1 and already has its bomb at (8,7).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (7,5) is safe because (8,6) is a 1 with its bomb already flagged at (8,7), so all other adjacent squares to (8,6) must be safe. Revealing (7,5) provides more information about the board without risking a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 7,5,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 1 1 1 1 2 3 F . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 . .\n4 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1\n5 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 2 1 1 1 _ _ _\n7 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . 1 1 1 1 F _ _\n9 . . . 1 F _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": false}
