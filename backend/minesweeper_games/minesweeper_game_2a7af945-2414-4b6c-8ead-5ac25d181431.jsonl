We have one confirmed flag (a potential bomb) at (0,3), marked by 'F'. Let's analyze the tiles to find a safe move or confirm a bomb.\n\n1. **Check Numbers with Adjacent Tiles:**\n   - Tile (0,2) has a '1' and an adjacent flag at (0,3), satisfying the condition. Therefore, we should avoid placing any more flags around (0,2).\n\n2. **Analyzing (1,3):**\n   - Tile (1,2) also has a '1' and has no adjacent flags, requiring a bomb nearby. Tile (1,3) is unexplored, and given that there are unrevealed tiles around and no flags, it is likely safe to reveal this tile based on the current constraint provided by number tiles above it.\n\n3. **Analyze (2,3):**\n   - Tile (2,2) is showing a '1' and already has a flag (0,3) adjacent fulfilling its requirement. Additionally, tiles around (2,4) show no direct constraints pointing that it should have a bomb, leading us to believe it's safe.\n\nGiven these observations, one logical unexplored tile to start revealing would be (1,3) as (1,2) requires a bomb, but the current adjacent tiles provide us a safe option in (1,3).\n\n### MOVE:\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (1,3) as it is surrounded by safe indicators from current information accessible from numerically marked tiles.\nMOVE: 1,3,false\n```", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 F . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 . 1 1 . . . .\n2 _ _ 1 1 1 2 . . . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 1 2 . . . .\n4 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n5 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n6 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n7 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n8 _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .", "sucess": false}
