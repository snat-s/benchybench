{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "I need to make my first move in this Minesweeper game. Since the board is completely unexplored, I should start by revealing a square that has the best chance of being safe.\n\nIn Minesweeper, the corners and edges have fewer adjacent tiles, which means slightly better odds of being safe. However, since this is the very first move and there are only 10 bombs in a 10x10 grid (10% bomb density), any move is relatively safe.\n\nA common strategy is to start with a move near the center of the board, as this often opens up more spaces if it happens to be an empty square.\n\nEXPLANATION: Making my first move near the center of the board to maximize the chance of opening up a large area. With only 10 bombs in 100 squares, the probability of hitting a bomb on the first move is just 10%.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

The positions (4,4), (4,5), and (5,4) are already revealed and have no bombs. This means the 3 bombs must be among the 5 remaining adjacent tiles: (4,6), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), and (6,6).\n\nAt position (4,5) with value '1', it already has adjacent to (3,6) with value '1', so (4,6) is likely safe.\n\n## Move Decision:\nI'll start by revealing (4,6) which should be safe based on the adjacent number patterns.\n\nEXPLANATION: The '1' at position (4,5) already has one adjacent bomb (likely in the area around positions (5,6) or (4,4)), making position (4,6) safe to reveal.\nMOVE: 4,6,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 1\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . .\n5 _ _ _ 1 1 3 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n7 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n8 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n9 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

The \"3\" at (5,5) means it has three adjacent bombs. Since all other adjacent cells around this \"3\" are either revealed numbers or unexplored spaces we haven't assessed yet, and position (6,5) is adjacent to multiple numbered cells, we can deduce it must contain a bomb.

The only unexplored spaces adjacent to this \"3\" are at (4,6), (5,6), and (6,6). Since we need exactly two bombs among these three cells, and the \"2\" at (4,6) is adjacent to two unexplored cells at (4,7) and (4,8), there must be at least one bomb in those two cells. Therefore, we can deduce that there can't be bombs in all three cells adjacent to the \"3\". Specifically, looking at the \"2\" at position (4,6), it needs exactly two bombs in its adjacent cells.
