Looking at the board, position (6,3) seems like a good candidate because it is adjacent to a '1' and a '2', but the '2' already has a bomb flagged next to it (at position (5,3) is not flagged but (5,4) is flagged), and the '1' at position (6,2) also has a bomb flagged next to it (at position (5,4) is flagged but not next to it, however (2,3), (3,3) and (3,4) are flagged). However, looking at the '2' at (4,3) and (4,2) we can see that there is a flag at (3,3), (3,4) and (2,3) so the bomb for (4,2) and (4,3) is already found so the only possible place for the bomb for (5,3) is at (5,3) itself or (5,2) or (4,4) or (6,3) or (6,4) or (6,2) or (7,3) or (7,2) or (7,4). However, if a bomb was at (6,2) then the '1' at (6,2) would be a '2' so it can't be there. Also, if a bomb was at (7,2) then the '2' at (7,1) would be a '3' so it can't be there. Also, if a bomb was at (7,3) then the '2' at (7,1) would be a '3' so it can't be there. Also, if a bomb was at (7,4) then the '2' at (7,1) would be a '3' so it can't be there. Also, if a bomb was at (6,4) then the '1' at (6,5) would be a '2' so it can't be there. Also, if a bomb was at (4,4) then the '1' at (4,5) would be a '2' so it can't be there. Also, if a bomb was at (5,2) then the '2' at (5,1) would be a '3' so it can't be there.
