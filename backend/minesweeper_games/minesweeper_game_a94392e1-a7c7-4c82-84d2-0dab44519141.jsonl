The '1' at (8,8) indicates exactly one bomb remains around the current flags\n2. The cluster of unrevealed squares '_' in rows 8-9 has limited possibilities\n3. Position (9,6) fits the constraints of the adjacent numbers\n4. We still have 4 flags remaining, which matches the total bomb count\n5. This move reduces uncertainty and helps map out the potential bomb locations\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on my reasoning or explain any part of the analysis?", "flags_remaining": 4, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . 1 1 2 . . . . . .\n2 . 1 F 1 1 2 1 2 . .\n3 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n4 . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 2 . .\n5 1 F 1 _ _ _ 1 . . .\n6 2 F 1 _ _ _ 1 . . .\n7 . 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . . .\n8 F F F _ _ _ 1 . 1 .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 .", "sucess": true}
