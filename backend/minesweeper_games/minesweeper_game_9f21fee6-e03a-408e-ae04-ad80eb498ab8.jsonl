This is the first move of the game.\n\nFor the first move in Minesweeper, it's generally best to click in the middle of the board. This maximizes the chance of opening up a large area, as corner and edge squares are more likely to be numbers with fewer constraints.\n\nEXPLANATION: Making the first move in the center of the board to maximize the chance of opening a large area. The center position gives the best odds of revealing multiple empty squares.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

This means it has exactly one bomb in the 8 adjacent squares. Looking at its surroundings:\n- It has a revealed empty space at (0,5)\n- It has a revealed number \"1\" at (1,6)\n- It has unrevealed spaces at (0,4), (1,5), and (2,4)\n\nHowever, the space at (0,4) is already a revealed \"1\", and (2,4) is already a revealed \"1\". So the bomb adjacent to (1,4) must be at (1,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: The \"1\" at position (1,4) can only have its bomb at (1,5) since its other adjacent positions are either revealed numbers or empty spaces.
