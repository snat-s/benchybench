The board is a 10x10 grid with various symbols:\n\n- **Period (.)**: Unexplored spaces.\n- **Underscore (_)**: Empty revealed spaces.\n- **Numbers (1-8)**: Indicate the number of adjacent bombs.\n- **Flags (F)**: Marked as potential bombs.\n  \nThe game information states there are **10 bombs** remaining, and **10 flags** are still available for placement.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Revealed Numbers and Their Adjacent Tiles\n\nI started by looking at the revealed numbers and their adjacent unexplored tiles to determine potential bomb locations.\n\n#### Example 1: Position (0,2) with Number '1'\n- **Adjacent Unexplored Tiles**: (1,1), (1,2)\n  \nSince the number '1' indicates there is exactly one bomb adjacent, and assuming there are no flags currently placed, any unexplored tiles adjacent to this number are potential bomb locations.\n\n#### Example 2: Position (1,2) with Number '2'\n- **Adjacent Unexplored Tiles**: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n  \nThe number '2' suggests there are two bombs in these adjacent tiles.\n\n### Step 3: Checking for Obvious Conflicts\n\nI needed to ensure that the flags I place do not conflict with the existing numbers.\n\n#### Checking Position (0,2) with Number '1'\n- If I place a flag at (1,1), then (1,2) cannot also be a bomb because the number '1' only allows one bomb adjacent.\n  \nThus, placing a flag at (1,1) would mean that (1,2) is safe to reveal.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying Remaining Flags and Bombs\n\nGiven that there are 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining, every flag placed should correspond to one bomb. It's essential to ensure that each flag is placed correctly to avoid mismanaging the remaining flags.\n\n### Step 5: Deciding the Next Move\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **Position (1,1)** is a potential bomb location adjacent to (0,2) with number '1'.\n- Placing a flag here aligns with the rule that there is exactly one bomb adjacent to (0,2).\n  \nTherefore, the next logical move is to place a flag at (1,1).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy systematically analyzing each revealed number and its adjacent tiles, I determined that placing a flag at (1,1) is a safe and strategic move that aligns with the game's rules and the current board state.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Placing a flag at (1,1) because it is the only possible bomb adjacent to the number '1' at (0,2).\n\n**MOVE:** 1,1,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . . 2 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n2 . . . 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _\n3 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n5 2 2 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n6 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 2 . .\n7 2 2 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n8 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .", "sucess": true}

So, '1' at (2,3) has one adjacent flag at (2,1). This is correct.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- (3,1): '2' with adjacent flags at (1,1) and (2,1). So, '2' has two adjacent flags.
