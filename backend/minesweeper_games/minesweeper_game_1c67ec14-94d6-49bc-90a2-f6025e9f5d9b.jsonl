Let's analyze each numbered square:\n\n1. **Square (0,0):** Shows '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n   - (0,1) to the right\n   - (1,0) below\n   - (1,1) diagonally down-right\n\n2. **Square (0,1):** Also shows '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n   - (0,0) to the left\n   - (1,0) diagonally down-left\n   - (1,1) below\n   - (1,2) diagonally down-right\n   - (0,2) to the right (unexplored)\n\n3. **Square (1,0):** Shows '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n   - (0,0) above\n   - (0,1) diagonally up-right\n   - (1,1) to the right\n   - (2,0) below (unexplored)\n   - (2,1) diagonally down-right (unexplored)\n\n### Determining Possible Mines\n\nSince all three squares show '1', each must have exactly one mine in their adjacent squares.\n\nLet's consider the overlaps:\n\n- **Square (0,0)'s adjacent squares:** (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n  - Among these, (1,1) is adjacent to all three numbered squares.\n\nIf we assume that (1,1) is a mine:\n- For (0,0): It has one mine at (1,1). \u2705\n- For (0,1): It has one mine at (1,1). \u2705\n- For (1,0): It has one mine at (1,1). \u2705\n\nThis scenario satisfies all three numbered squares.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that (1,1) is not a mine, we need to find mines in other adjacent squares:\n- For (0,0): Possible mines at (0,1) or (1,0)\n- For (0,1): Possible mines at (0,0) or (1,0)\n- For (1,0): Possible mines at (0,0) or (0,1)\n\nHowever, placing mines at (0,1) and (1,0) would mean:\n- (0,0) would have two mines adjacent, which contradicts its '1' indicator.\n  \nTherefore, the only consistent placement is having a mine at (1,1).\n\n### Verifying the Flag Placement\n\nBefore placing a flag at (1,1), we need to ensure it doesn't conflict with any other numbers. Since all adjacent numbers to (1,1) are '1's, and we've deduced that (1,1) must be the mine to satisfy these numbers, placing a flag here is consistent.\n\n### Considering the Number of Flags and Bombs\n\nThe game provides:\n- **Flags remaining:** 10\n- **Bombs:** 10\n\nSince we've identified one bomb at (1,1), placing a flag here reduces the remaining flags to 9 and the remaining bombs to 9. This is in line with the game's constraints.\n\n### Deciding on the Move\n\nBased on the analysis, the safest and most logical move is to place a flag at (1,1), as it is the confirmed location of a bomb that satisfies all adjacent numbered squares.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The square at (1,1) must be a bomb to satisfy the adjacent numbered squares (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0), all showing '1's.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,1,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 1 . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Since (1,1) is already flagged and (1,0) is revealed as '1', the only unexplored adjacent square is (0,1).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The square at (0,1) is safe to reveal since the '1' at (0,0) is already satisfied by the bomb at (1,1).\n\n### MOVE:\nEXPLANATION: The '1' at (0,0) is already satisfied by the bomb at (1,1), so the adjacent square at (0,1) is safe to reveal.\nMOVE: 0,1,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 1 F . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
