{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs. I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after making this move, the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '2'. That means there are exactly two bombs adjacent to this cell.\n\nNext, I need to look at the adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (4,4) are:\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n- (4,3),         (4,5)\n\n- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nI need to check if any of these are already flagged or revealed. Since this is the first move, none should be flagged or revealed yet, except for (4,4) itself.\n\nGiven that it's a '2', I know that exactly two of these eight adjacent cells contain bombs. I need to consider where to place flags or make further reveals.\n\nSince I don't have any other information yet, I can't be sure which two cells contain the bombs. So, I might need to make another reveal in an adjacent cell to get more information.\n\nLet's say I choose to reveal (4,5). If it's safe, it will reveal another number or an empty cell.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing an adjacent cell to get more information about bomb positions.\n\nMOVE: 4,5,false\n\nNow, suppose (4,5) reveals a '1'. This means there is exactly one bomb adjacent to (4,5). The adjacent cells to (4,5) are:\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\n- (4,4), (4,6)\n\n- (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nFrom this, I know that one of these eight cells contains a bomb.\n\nBut I already know from (4,4) being a '2' that two of its adjacent cells contain bombs. So, cells (4,3), (4,5), (3,4), (3,5), (5,4), (5,5) are shared between the two revealed cells.\n\nGiven that (4,5) shows '1', it has one bomb adjacent. But considering (4,4) shows '2', and they share some adjacent cells, I need to see if there's any overlap that can help me deduce where the bombs are.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky without actually seeing the board, but generally, I would look for cells that are only adjacent to one of the revealed numbers.\n\nFor example, if (4,6) is only adjacent to (4,5), and no other revealed numbers, and (4,5) shows '1', then perhaps (4,6) could be safe, but I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find a cell that is adjacent to both revealed numbers, and I can deduce that it must contain a bomb or must be safe based on the numbers.\n\nSince this is getting complicated without actual board state, I'll assume that after revealing (4,5) as '1', I look for a cell that's adjacent only to (4,5) and try to reveal it.\n\nLet's say I choose to reveal (4,6).\n\nEXPLANATION: Attempting to expand safe area by revealing a cell adjacent to the '1'.\n\nMOVE: 4,6,false\n\nSuppose (4,6) reveals a '0'. In Minesweeper, a '0' means there are no adjacent bombs, and it automatically reveals all adjacent cells.\n\nSo, revealing (4,6) as '0' would reveal all its adjacent cells: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7).\n\nNow, since (4,5) is already revealed as '1', and (4,6) is '0', which reveals surrounding cells, I can update my knowledge about those cells.\n\nAssuming that after this reveal, some cells are still unexplored, I would look for patterns to place flags or make further safe reveals.\n\nFor example, if after revealing (4,6) as '0', I see that (3,5) is revealed as '1', and it has one adjacent unflagged cell, I might place a flag there.\n\nBut since I don't have the actual board state, I'll assume that after revealing (4,6) as '0', I have a clearer area with some numbers indicating bomb counts.\n\nAt this point, I would continue to make moves based on the numbers and the flags I've placed, ensuring that I don't violate any of the critical flag placement rules.\n\nRemember, the key is to ensure that the number of flags around a revealed number matches exactly the value of that number.\n\nAlso, I need to keep track of the remaining flags and bombs. Since there are 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining initially, I need to make sure that I don't place more flags than the remaining bombs.\n\nAs I reveal more cells and place flags, I should adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nIn summary, my next move, given the initial state, is to reveal the center cell to start expanding the safe area.\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
