Since these '1's don't have any adjacent flags, the adjacent unexplored tiles must contain exactly one bomb.\n\nHowever, since there are multiple unexplored tiles adjacent to these '1's, I can't determine the exact location of the bomb yet. Therefore, I need to look for a position where the number of adjacent unexplored tiles equals the number of bombs indicated by the number.\n\nFor example, at position (3,0), which is a '1', and it has four adjacent unexplored tiles: (2,0), (2,1), (4,0), and (4,1). Since it's a '1', only one of these tiles is a bomb. Without additional information, I can't determine which one.\n\nSimilarly, at position (6,0), which is a '1', and it has four adjacent unexplored tiles: (5,0), (5,1), (7,0), and (7,1). Again, only one of these is a bomb.\n\n### Looking for Definite Bombs:\n\nI need to find a position where the number of adjacent unexplored tiles equals the number of bombs indicated by the number, and there are no flags already placed.\n\nAt position (7,1), which is a '2', and it has six adjacent unexplored tiles: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (8,0), (8,1), and (8,2). Since it's a '2', two of these tiles are bombs. However, without more information, I can't determine which ones.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I don't see any immediate safe moves or definite bombs to flag. Therefore, the safest approach is to reveal a tile that has the lowest probability of being a bomb.\n\nLooking at the unexplored tiles, I notice that position (0,0) is adjacent to the '1' at (1,0) and (1,1). Since these '1's don't have any adjacent flags, there's a chance that (0,0) could be a bomb, but it's not certain.\n\nAlternatively, position (9,9) is completely unexplored and not adjacent to any numbers, making it a safer choice to reveal.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Since there are no immediate safe moves or definite bombs to flag, I'll choose to reveal a tile that is less likely to be a bomb. Position (9,9) is unexplored and not adjacent to any numbers, making it a safer choice.\n\n**MOVE:** 9,9,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 1 1 1 _ 1 2 2 1 _ _\n2 . . 1 _ 1 . . 1 _ _\n3 1 1 1 _ 1 2 2 1 _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n5 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n6 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n7 . 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . . .\n8 . . 1 1 1 2 1 . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Since the number is `1`, exactly one of these adjacent cells is a bomb. However, without additional information, we cannot determine which one it is. So, this cell doesn't provide immediate actionable information.\n\nSimilarly, **Cell (1,1):** Number `1`\n\nAdjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nAgain, all adjacent cells are unexplored, and the number `1` indicates exactly one bomb among them. No immediate conclusions can be drawn.\n\nHowever, let's consider **Cell (1,5):** Number `2`\n\nAdjacent cells: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nAll adjacent cells are unexplored. The number `2` means exactly two of these adjacent cells are bombs. Without more information, we cannot determine which ones.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to look for cells where the number of adjacent unexplored cells equals the number on the cell. In such cases, we can flag all those adjacent cells as bombs.\n\nLet's look for such instances.\n\n#### Potential Flag Placements:\n\nLet's examine **Cell (4,8):** Number `1`\n\nAdjacent cells: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (3,7): Unexplored\n- (3,8): Unexplored\n- (3,9): Unexplored\n- (4,7): Unexplored\n- (4,9): Revealed as `1`\n- (5,7): Unexplored\n- (5,8): Revealed as `2`\n- (5,9): Unexplored\n\nSo, the unexplored adjacent cells are: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (5,7), (5,9)\n\nThe number is `1`, so exactly one of these cells is a bomb. Since there are multiple unexplored cells, we cannot flag any of them confidently yet.\n\nLet's try another cell.\n\n**Cell (5,8):** Number `2`\n\nAdjacent cells: (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (4,7): Unexplored\n- (4,8): Revealed as `1`\n- (4,9): Revealed as `1`\n- (5,7): Revealed as `1`\n- (5,9): Unexplored\n- (6,7): Unexplored\n- (6,8): Unexplored\n- (6,9): Unexplored\n\nSo, the unexplored adjacent cells are: (4,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)\n\nThe number is `2`, so exactly two of these cells are bombs. Again, there are multiple possibilities, so we cannot confidently flag any of them.\n\nPerhaps I need to look for a different approach. Let's try to see if any revealed number has fewer adjacent unexplored cells than its number, which would make it impossible to place the required number of bombs.\n\nWait, that's not the case here. All numbers have enough adjacent unexplored cells to accommodate their bomb counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for cells where the number of adjacent unexplored cells equals the number on the cell, meaning all those adjacent cells must be bombs.\n\nWait, let's check for that.\n\n#### Checking for Cells Where Number Equals Adjacent Unexplored Cells:\n\nLet's examine **Cell (4,9):** Number `1`\n\nAdjacent cells: (3,8), (3,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9)\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (3,8): Unexplored\n- (3,9): Unexplored\n- (4,8): Revealed as `1`\n- (5,8): Revealed as `2`\n- (5,9): Unexplored\n\nSo, the unexplored adjacent cells are: (3,8), (3,9), (5,9)\n\nThe number is `1`, so exactly one of these cells is a bomb. Since there are three unexplored cells, we cannot flag any of them confidently.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider **Cell (9,9):** Number `1`\n\nAdjacent cells: (8,8), (8,9), (9,8)\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (8,8): Unexplored\n- (8,9): Revealed as `1`\n- (9,8): Unexplored\n\nSo, the unexplored adjacent cells are: (8,8), (9,8)\n\nThe number is `1`, so exactly one of these cells is a bomb. Since there are two unexplored cells, we cannot flag either confidently.\n\nHmm, it seems that in this current state, there are no cells where the number of adjacent unexplored cells equals the number on the cell, meaning we cannot confidently flag any cells as bombs at this moment.\n\n### Step 4: Looking for Safe Cells to Reveal\n\nSince I cannot confidently flag any cells as bombs, I'll look for cells that are safe to reveal. A cell is safe if it's unexplored and doesn't need to be a bomb based on the current information.\n\nLet's consider **Cell (0,0):** Unexplored\n\nAdjacent cells: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (0,1): Unexplored\n- (1,0): Revealed as `1`\n- (1,1): Revealed as `1`\n\nThe revealed cells (1,0) and (1,1) are both `1`, indicating that each has exactly one bomb adjacent. However, since (0,0) is unexplored, and it's adjacent to both (1,0) and (1,1), it could be a bomb or safe.\n\nLet's analyze further.\n\n**Cell (1,0):** Number `1`\n\nAdjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)\n\nAll adjacent cells are unexplored except (1,1), which is also `1`. Since (1,0) is `1`, one of its adjacent unexplored cells is a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, **Cell (1,1):** Number `1`\n\nAdjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nAll adjacent cells are unexplored except (1,0), which is `1`. So, one of its adjacent unexplored cells is a bomb.\n\nNow, considering both (1,0) and (1,1) are `1` and share the adjacent cell (0,0), (0,1), and (1,2), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- (1,0)'s adjacent unexplored cells: (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,1)\n- (1,1)'s adjacent unexplored cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nBoth (1,0) and (1,1) require one bomb each among their adjacent unexplored cells.\n\nIf (0,0) is a bomb, then it satisfies the bomb count for both (1,0) and (1,1).\n\nAlternatively, if (0,1) is a bomb, it also satisfies both (1,0) and (1,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,0) or (2,1) being a bomb would satisfy (1,0), but (1,1) would still need one more bomb from (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2).\n\nTherefore, it's possible that (0,0) or (0,1) is a bomb, satisfying both (1,0) and (1,1).\n\nHowever, since we cannot be certain, revealing (0,0) could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider another cell.\n\n**Cell (2,2):** Number `1`\n\nAdjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (1,1): Revealed as `1`\n- (1,2): Unexplored\n- (1,3): Unexplored\n- (2,1): Unexplored\n- (2,3): Unexplored\n- (3,1): Revealed as `1`\n- (3,2): Revealed as `1`\n- (3,3): Unexplored\n\nSo, the unexplored adjacent cells are: (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,3)\n\nThe number is `1`, so exactly one of these cells is a bomb.\n\nAgain, multiple possibilities, so we cannot confidently flag any of them.\n\nPerhaps I need to look for a cell that is less risky to reveal.\n\nLet's consider **Cell (6,2):** Unexplored\n\nAdjacent cells: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (5,1): Unexplored\n- (5,2): Unexplored\n- (5,3): Unexplored\n- (6,1): Revealed as `1`\n- (6,3): Unexplored\n- (7,1): Revealed as `2`\n- (7,2): Revealed as `1`\n- (7,3): Unexplored\n\nSo, the unexplored adjacent cells are: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3)\n\nLooking at the revealed adjacent cells:\n\n- (6,1): Number `1`\n- (7,1): Number `2`\n- (7,2): Number `1`\n\nLet's analyze the implications.\n\n**Cell (6,1):** Number `1`\n\nAdjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (5,0): Unexplored\n- (5,1): Unexplored\n- (5,2): Unexplored\n- (6,0): Revealed as `1`\n- (6,2): Unexplored\n- (7,0): Unexplored\n- (7,1): Revealed as `2`\n- (7,2): Revealed as `1`\n\nSo, the unexplored adjacent cells are: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (7,0)\n\nThe number is `1`, so exactly one of these cells is a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, **Cell (7,2):** Number `1`\n\nAdjacent cells: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (6,1): Revealed as `1`\n- (6,2): Unexplored\n- (6,3): Unexplored\n- (7,1): Revealed as `2`\n- (7,3): Unexplored\n- (8,1): Unexplored\n- (8,2): Revealed as `1`\n- (8,3): Revealed as `1`\n\nSo, the unexplored adjacent cells are: (6,2), (6,3), (7,3), (8,1)\n\nThe number is `1`, so exactly one of these cells is a bomb.\n\nNow, considering both (6,1) and (7,2) are `1`, and they share the adjacent cell (6,2), (6,3), (7,3), etc.\n\nIf (6,2) is a bomb, it would satisfy both (6,1) and (7,2).\n\nAlternatively, if (6,3) is a bomb, it would satisfy (6,1), but (7,2) would still need another bomb from (6,2), (7,3), or (8,1).\n\nSimilarly, if (7,3) is a bomb, it would satisfy (7,2), but (6,1) would still need another bomb from (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (7,0).\n\nTherefore, (6,2) seems to be a potential bomb candidate, but we cannot be certain.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, revealing (6,2) could be risky, as it might be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider **Cell (7,0):** Unexplored\n\nAdjacent cells: (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1)\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (6,0): Revealed as `1`\n- (6,1): Revealed as `1`\n- (7,1): Revealed as `2`\n- (8,0): Unexplored\n- (8,1): Unexplored\n\nSo, the unexplored adjacent cells are: (8,0), (8,1)\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications.\n\n**Cell (6,0):** Number `1`\n\nAdjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1)\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (5,0): Unexplored\n- (5,1): Unexplored\n- (6,1): Revealed as `1`\n- (7,0): Unexplored\n- (7,1): Revealed as `2`\n\nSo, the unexplored adjacent cells are: (5,0), (5,1), (7,0)\n\nThe number is `1`, so exactly one of these cells is a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, **Cell (6,1):** Number `1`\n\nAdjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (5,0): Unexplored\n- (5,1): Unexplored\n- (5,2): Unexplored\n- (6,0): Revealed as `1`\n- (6,2): Unexplored\n- (7,0): Unexplored\n- (7,1): Revealed as `2`\n- (7,2): Revealed as `1`\n\nSo, the unexplored adjacent cells are: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (7,0)\n\nThe number is `1`, so exactly one of these cells is a bomb.\n\nNow, considering both (6,0) and (6,1) are `1`, and they share the adjacent cell (5,0), (5,1), (7,0).\n\nIf (5,0) is a bomb, it would satisfy both (6,0) and (6,1).\n\nAlternatively, if (5,1) is a bomb, it would also satisfy both (6,0) and (6,1).\n\nTherefore, (7,0) cannot be a bomb because both (6,0) and (6,1) already have their required bombs in (5,0) or (5,1).\n\nThus, **Cell (7,0)** is safe to reveal.\n\n### Step 5: Making the Move\n\nBased on the above analysis, **Cell (7,0)** is safe to reveal because it cannot be a bomb based on the current numbers and adjacent cells.\n\n**Explanation:** Both (6,0) and (6,1) have numbers `1` and share adjacent cells (5,0), (5,1), and (7,0). For both (6,0) and (6,1) to have exactly one bomb adjacent, the bomb must be in either (5,0) or (5,1). Therefore, (7,0) cannot be a bomb and is safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 7,0,false\n\nThis means I will reveal the cell at row 7, column 0, without placing a flag.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 1 1 1 _ 1 2 2 1 _ _\n2 . . 1 _ 1 . . 1 _ _\n3 1 1 1 _ 1 2 2 1 _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n5 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n6 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n7 . 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . . .\n8 . . 1 1 1 2 1 . 1 1\n9 . . . . . . . . . 1", "sucess": false}
