{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "For the first move in Minesweeper, it's generally best to start with a corner or edge position to minimize the number of adjacent tiles. The corners are especially good starting points as they only have 3 adjacent tiles instead of 8 for central positions, reducing the probability of hitting a bomb.\n\nI recommend starting with the top-left corner as it's a common and safe starting strategy.\n\nEXPLANATION: Starting with the top-left corner (0,0) as it only has 3 adjacent squares, minimizing the risk of hitting a bomb on the first move.

Given that each '1' needs exactly one bomb adjacent to it, and given the overlap between these two '1's, we can deduce that the bomb must be at (0,6) to satisfy both '1's simultaneously.\n\nEXPLANATION: The '1' at (0,5) and the '1' at (1,5) share adjacent squares.
