This leaves one more flag to place for the (2,3) element: it means the bomb count is already fulfilling this requirement\n\n4. In row 4, columns 8 and 9:\n    - (4,8) has a F. There are two bombs revealed at (4,7) and (4,9) .\n\n### Flags Verification:\nFrom critical flag placement rules, no flag should need placement in the following:\n- (4, 9)'s flag placement.\n\nHence, let's try and place flags where there is potential conflicts and might yield to another bomb being flag.\n\n### Verification Flag Placement:\n\nConclusively, no other flags have potential to be placed around any lighting or remaining areas ports number conflicts for adjacent bombs.\n\n### Next Move:\nLet's reveal a tile to gather more information. We can reveal the tile at (7, 4) as it has potential to reveal more numbers we don't evaluative-conflict on the match.\n\nEXPLANATION: There might be a bomb there.\n\nMOVE: 7,4,false", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ _ F .\n1 _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ 1 1\n2 _ 1 .
