Therefore, I will flag (2,5) because:\n- It's adjacent to (2,6) which has 3 bomb indicators and will help control conflicts around it.\n\n### Conclusion:\nI will place a flag at (2,5) to potentially limit the bomb distribution in that area.\n\nEXPLANATION: I will place a flag at (2,5) as it is strategically significant adjacent to the tile (2,6) which indicates it requires a bomb due to its higher number limit, and it will help manage the potential conflicts with other numbers.\n\nMOVE: 2,5,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n2 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 3 . . .\n3 _ 1 . 1 _ 1 . . . .\n4 1 3 . 3 1 2 . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

For the number `1` at (0,6), only one adjacent square can contain a bomb. Currently, there is one flagged square at (1,6), which is correct.\n\n2. For the number `1` at (1,6), again, there is one flagged (1,6), which is consistent and correct.\n\n3. For the number `1` at (4,0), there is no flag, meaning we should investigate that area further.\n\n4. The number `3` at (2,6) has one flag already in place (2,5). Hence, there must be two more bombs in one of the unexplored tiles adjacent to (2,6).\n\n5. The number `3` at (4,1) indicates that there are three bombs in adjacent tiles so we need to analyze its surroundings. There are 5 adjacent squares, one of which (4,0) has already been marked with a potential flag.\n\n6. The number `2` at (4,4) suggests two bombs can be found in the surrounding unexplored tiles (4,3), (5,4),(3,4), and (3,3). There is only one flag so we need to flag more in this section.\n\nNow let's focus on revealing or flagging the adjacent unexplored spaces. A critical spot is (4,1) and (4,4), as they might inform us about potential bombs based on the existing numbers. The tiles (3,2), (3,3), and (4,3) are candidates as they can fulfill multiple conditions across the numbers.\n\nGiven the existing flags and bombs:\n\n1. Since (2,7) has no adjacent flags, let's proceed to **reveal tile (2,7)**. It is a good candidate to investigate since it is near flags and numbers and can't be a bomb.\n\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal the tile (2,7) as it is adjacent to several numbers and currently has no flags.
