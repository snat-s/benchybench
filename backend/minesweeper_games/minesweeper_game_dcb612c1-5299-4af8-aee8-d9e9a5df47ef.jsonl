The rest of the board is unexplored.\n\n### Analyzing Revealed Numbers\n\nLet's examine the numbers and their adjacent tiles:\n\n1. **Tile (0,2)**: Shows '1'.\n   - Adjacent tiles: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n   \n2. **Tile (1,2)**: Shows '1'.\n   - Adjacent tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n   \n3. **Tile (2,0)**: Shows '1'.\n   - Adjacent tiles: (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1)\n   \n4. **Tile (2,1)**: Shows '1'.\n   - Adjacent tiles: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n   \n5. **Tile (2,2)**: Shows '1'.\n   - Adjacent tiles: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n### Identifying Potential Bomb Locations\n\nLet's focus on **Tile (0,2)** which shows '1'. Its adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (0,1): Empty revealed space (`_`)\n- (0,3): Unexplored (`.`)\n- (1,1): Empty revealed space (`_`)\n- (1,2): Shows '1'\n- (1,3): Unexplored (`.`)\n\nSince (0,1) and (1,1) are empty revealed spaces, they cannot be bombs. Therefore, the bomb adjacent to (0,2) must be either (0,3) or (1,3).\n\nSimilarly, **Tile (1,2)** shows '1'. Its adjacent tiles include:\n\n- (0,1): Empty revealed space (`_`)\n- (0,2): Shows '1'\n- (0,3): Unexplored (`.`)\n- (1,1): Empty revealed space (`_`)\n- (1,3): Unexplored (`.`)\n- (2,1): Shows '1'\n- (2,2): Shows '1'\n- (2,3): Unexplored (`.`)\n\nAgain, (0,1) and (1,1) are empty, so the bomb adjacent to (1,2) must be either (0,3), (1,3), or (2,3).\n\n### Cross-Referencing Adjacent Tiles\n\nLooking at both (0,2) and (1,2), the potential bomb locations overlap at (0,3) and (1,3). Since both tiles show '1', and they share these two unexplored tiles, it's logical to deduce that one of these two tiles is a bomb.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the entire board and ensure that placing a flag doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\n### Considering Tile (2,0) and (2,1)\n\nLet's look at **Tile (2,0)** which shows '1'. Its adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (1,0): Empty revealed space (`_`)\n- (1,1): Empty revealed space (`_`)\n- (2,1): Shows '1'\n- (3,0): Unexplored (`.`)\n- (3,1): Unexplored (`.`)\n\nSince (1,0) and (1,1) are empty, the bomb adjacent to (2,0) must be either (3,0) or (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, **Tile (2,1)** shows '1'. Its adjacent tiles include:\n\n- (1,0): Empty revealed space (`_`)\n- (1,1): Empty revealed space (`_`)\n- (1,2): Shows '1'\n- (2,0): Shows '1'\n- (2,2): Shows '1'\n- (3,0): Unexplored (`.`)\n- (3,1): Unexplored (`.`)\n- (3,2): Unexplored (`.`)\n\nAgain, (1,0) and (1,1) are empty, so the bomb adjacent to (2,1) must be among (3,0), (3,1), or (3,2).\n\n### Consolidating the Information\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n\n- **Potential Bombs in Row 0-1**: (0,3) or (1,3)\n- **Potential Bombs in Row 2-3**: (3,0), (3,1), or (3,2)\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that placing a flag doesn't violate any existing numbers. Let's verify:\n\nIf we place a flag at (0,3):\n\n- **Tile (0,2)**: Now has one adjacent bomb (0,3), which satisfies its '1'.\n- **Tile (1,2)**: Now has one adjacent bomb (0,3), but it requires '1'. However, (1,3) is still unexplored, so this doesn't necessarily conflict yet.\n\nIf we place a flag at (1,3):\n\n- **Tile (1,2)**: Now has one adjacent bomb (1,3), which satisfies its '1'.\n- **Tile (0,2)**: Now has no adjacent bombs, which contradicts its '1'.\n\nTherefore, placing a flag at (1,3) would conflict with **Tile (0,2)**, which still needs one adjacent bomb.\n\nThus, **Tile (0,3)** is the safer choice for placing a flag.\n\n### Making the Move\n\n**EXPLANATION:** After analyzing the adjacent tiles and ensuring that placing a flag at (0,3) doesn't conflict with any revealed numbers, it's the most logical move. This decision is based on the need to satisfy the '1' on **Tile (0,2)** without causing inconsistencies with other numbered tiles.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,3,true\n\nThis move places a flag at coordinates (0,3), indicating that we believe there is a bomb there. This choice helps us manage the remaining bombs and ensures that our flag placement aligns with the revealed numbers on the board.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n2 1 1 1 . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Therefore, the bomb adjacent to (0,2) is already accounted for by this flag.\n  - This means none of the other adjacent squares can contain a bomb.\n\n**Square (1,2): `1`**\n- Adjacent squares: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n  - (0,3) is flagged (`F`).

Therefore, it's not safe to reveal.\n\n**Square (3,1):**\n- Adjacent to (2,0): `1`, (2,1): `1`, (2,2): `1`\n- The bomb adjacent to (2,0) could be here, but since (2,1) and (2,2) also have one bomb each, and we haven't identified their positions, (3,1) is a potential bomb location. Thus, it's not safe to reveal.\n\n### Deciding on the Next Move\n\nBased on the above deductions, the safest move is to reveal a square that we are certain does not contain a bomb. The squares (0,1), (1,1), and (1,3) are all safe to reveal.\n\n**Choosing Square (0,1):**\n- It's in the top row and already adjacent to a revealed number, making it a straightforward choice for revealing.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n**EXPLANATION:**  \nSquare (0,1) is adjacent to (0,2): `1`, which already has a flagged bomb at (0,3).

Therefore, there can be no other bombs in the remaining adjacent squares: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\n**Row 1:**\n- Position (1,2) has a `1`.\n\nAnalyzing (1,2):\n\n- Adjacent squares:\n  - (0,1)\n  - (0,2)\n  - (0,3) \u2190 Flagged (`F`)\n  - (1,1)\n  - (1,3)\n  - (2,1)\n  - (2,2)\n  - (2,3)\n\nGiven that (0,3) is flagged and represents the bomb adjacent to (1,2), there should be no other bombs in the remaining adjacent squares.\n\n**Row 2:**\n- Positions (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2) all have `1`s.\n\nLet's examine each:\n\n**Position (2,0):**\n- Adjacent squares:\n  - (1,0)\n  - (1,1)\n  - (2,1)\n\nOnly (2,1) is revealed as `1`. Since (2,0) has a `1`, there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to it. Given that (2,1) is `1`, it implies that (1,0) and (1,1) cannot both be bombs. However, since (2,1) is already `1`, it's likely that one of (1,0) or (1,1) is a bomb, but we need more information.\n\n**Position (2,1):**\n- Adjacent squares:\n  - (1,0)\n  - (1,1)\n  - (1,2)\n  - (2,0)\n  - (2,2)\n\nGiven that (2,1) is `1`, there must be exactly one bomb in these squares. Since (1,2) is `1` and we've already accounted for one bomb adjacent to it, it's possible that (1,1) or (2,0) is a bomb.\n\n**Position (2,2):**\n- Adjacent squares:\n  - (1,1)\n  - (1,2)\n  - (1,3)\n  - (2,1)\n  - (2,3)\n\nHere, (2,2) is `1`. Since (1,3) is flagged (`F`), it represents the bomb adjacent to (2,2). Therefore, there can be no other bombs in the remaining adjacent squares: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3).\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n\n1. **Position (0,1):**\n   - Adjacent to (0,2) which has a `1`.\n   - Since (0,3) is flagged as the bomb adjacent to (0,2), (0,1) must be safe.\n   \n   **Action:** Reveal (0,1).\n\n2. **Position (1,1):**\n   - Adjacent to (1,2) which has a `1`.\n   - (0,3) is flagged as the bomb adjacent to (1,2), so (1,1) must be safe.\n   \n   **Action:** Reveal (1,1).\n\n3. **Position (1,3):**\n   - Adjacent to (1,2) which has a `1`.\n   - (0,3) is flagged as the bomb adjacent to (1,2), so (1,3) must be safe.\n   \n   **Action:** Reveal (1,3).\n\n### Verifying Flag Placement\n\nLooking at the flagged position (0,3):\n\n- It's adjacent to (0,2) and (1,2), both of which have `1`s.\n- Since (0,3) is flagged, it satisfies the bomb count for both (0,2) and (1,2).\n  \nThere's no conflict here, so the flag at (0,3) is correctly placed.\n\n### Considering the Remaining Flags and Bombs\n\n- **Total Bombs:** 10\n- **Flags Remaining:** 9\n\nSince there's one flag already placed at (0,3), we have 9 flags left to place, matching the remaining 9 bombs.\n\n### Deciding the Next Move\n\nGiven that (0,1), (1,1), and (1,3) are safe to reveal, I'll choose to reveal one of them.

Therefore, the number `1` at `(0,2)` is satisfied by this flag. Consequently, none of the other adjacent tiles `(0,1)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(1,3)` can be bombs.\n\n2. **Tile (1,2):** `1`\n   - **Adjacent Tiles:** `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(0,3)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,3)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`, `(2,3)`\n   - **Flag at (0,3):** Already accounted for. Therefore, the number `1` at `(1,2)` is also satisfied by this flag. Hence, none of the other adjacent tiles can be bombs.\n\n3. **Tile (2,0):** `1`\n   - **Adjacent Tiles:** `(1,0)`, `(1,1)`, `(2,1)`, `(3,0)`, `(3,1)`\n   - **No Flags Adjacent:** Since there are no flags adjacent to `(2,0)`, and the number is `1`, there must be exactly one bomb among the adjacent tiles.\n\n4. **Tile (2,1):** `1`\n   - **Adjacent Tiles:** `(1,0)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,0)`, `(2,2)`, `(3,0)`, `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`\n   - **No Flags Adjacent:** Similar to `(2,0)`, there's a number `1` with no adjacent flags, indicating exactly one bomb among the adjacent tiles.\n\n5. **Tile (2,2):** `1`\n   - **Adjacent Tiles:** `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,3)`, `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`\n   - **No Flags Adjacent:** Again, a number `1` with no adjacent flags means exactly one bomb in the adjacent tiles.\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves\n\nGiven the analysis, here are the safe moves we can deduce:\n\n- **Tile (0,1):** Adjacent to `(0,2)` which already has its bomb count satisfied by the flag at `(0,3)`. Therefore, `(0,1)` is safe to reveal.\n\n- **Tile (1,1):** Adjacent to `(1,2)` which has its bomb count satisfied by the flag at `(0,3)`. Thus, `(1,1)` is safe to reveal.\n\n- **Tile (1,3):** Adjacent to both `(0,2)` and `(1,2)`, both of which have their bomb counts satisfied. Therefore, `(1,3)` is safe to reveal.\n\n### Deciding on the Next Move\n\nAmong the safe tiles identified, it's efficient to reveal a tile that can provide more information about the surrounding area. Revealing `(1,1)` seems strategic because it's adjacent to several tiles, including `(0,1)` and `(2,1)`, which could help in further deductions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the next move should be to reveal the tile at coordinates `(1,1)`.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The tile at (1,1) is adjacent to (1,2), which already has its bomb count satisfied by the flag at (0,3).

This implies that our initial assumption might be incorrect, or there might be bombs in non-shared adjacent cells.\n\n### **Re-evaluating the Adjacent Cells**\n\nLet's consider non-shared adjacent cells for each position:\n\n#### **Position (2,0): '1'**\n\n**Adjacent Cells:**\n- (1,0)\n- (1,1)\n- (2,1)\n- (3,0)\n- (3,1)\n\nPossible bomb locations: (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1)\n\n#### **Position (2,1): '1'**\n\n**Adjacent Cells:**\n- (1,0)\n- (1,1)\n- (1,2)\n- (2,0)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,0)\n- (3,1)\n- (3,2)\n\nPossible bomb locations: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n#### **Position (2,2): '1'**\n\n**Adjacent Cells:**\n- (1,1)\n- (1,2)\n- (1,3)\n- (2,1)\n- (2,3)\n- (3,1)\n- (3,2)\n- (3,3)\n\nPossible bomb locations: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n### **Looking for Unique Bomb Positions**\n\nWe need to find a configuration where each '1' has exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells, and no bomb is shared in a way that contradicts the numbers.\n\nLet's attempt to place bombs in cells that affect only one '1' number.\n\n#### **Potential Bomb at (3,3):**\n\n**Affects Only:**\n- (2,2)\n\n**Impact:**\n- (2,2) would have one bomb adjacent, satisfying its '1'.\n- (2,0) and (2,1) would not have bombs in their adjacent cells, which contradicts their '1's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Bomb cannot be at (3,3).\n\n#### **Potential Bomb at (3,2):**\n\n**Affects Only:**\n- (2,2)\n\n**Impact:**\n- Similar to (3,3), (2,0) and (2,1) would lack adjacent bombs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Bomb cannot be at (3,2).\n\n#### **Potential Bomb at (3,1):**\n\n**Affects Only:**\n- (2,1)\n\n**Impact:**\n- (2,1) would have one bomb adjacent, satisfying its '1'.\n- (2,0) and (2,2) would lack adjacent bombs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Bomb cannot be at (3,1).\n\n#### **Potential Bomb at (3,0):**\n\n**Affects Only:**\n- (2,0)\n\n**Impact:**\n- (2,0) would have one bomb adjacent, satisfying its '1'.\n- (2,1) and (2,2) would lack adjacent bombs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Bomb cannot be at (3,0).\n\n#### **Potential Bomb at (1,3):**\n\n**Affects Only:**\n- (2,2)\n\n**Impact:**\n- Similar to (3,2) and (3,3), (2,0) and (2,1) would lack adjacent bombs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Bomb cannot be at (1,3).\n\n#### **Potential Bomb at (1,2):**\n\n**Affects:**\n- (2,1)\n- (2,2)\n\n**Impact:**\n- (2,1) and (2,2) would each have one bomb adjacent, satisfying their '1's.\n- (2,0) would lack an adjacent bomb, which contradicts its '1'.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Bomb cannot be at (1,2).\n\n#### **Potential Bomb at (1,1):**\n\n**Affects:**\n- (2,0)\n- (2,1)\n- (2,2)\n\n**Impact:**\n- All three positions would have one bomb adjacent, satisfying their '1's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- This is a possible bomb location.\n\nHowever, earlier, we saw that placing a bomb at (1,1) would mean all three positions have a bomb adjacent, which initially seemed to conflict because each '1' should have exactly one bomb. But in reality, if a single bomb is adjacent to multiple '1's, it satisfies each '1' individually, as long as no '1' has more than one bomb adjacent.\n\nWait, no. Each '1' should have exactly one bomb adjacent. If a bomb is at (1,1), it's adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2), meaning each of these '1's has exactly one bomb adjacent. This actually satisfies all three '1's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Bomb can be placed at (1,1).\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Position (2,0): '1'**\n  - Adjacent bomb: (1,1) \u2013 satisfies '1'.\n  \n- **Position (2,1): '1'**\n  - Adjacent bomb: (1,1) \u2013 satisfies '1'.\n  \n- **Position (2,2): '1'**\n  - Adjacent bomb: (1,1) \u2013 satisfies '1'.\n\nThis configuration works without conflicts.\n\n### **Determining Safe Cells to Reveal**\n\nNow that we've deduced that there's a bomb at (1,1), let's identify which cells are safe to reveal based on this information.\n\n#### **Position (0,2): '1'**\n\n**Adjacent Cells:**\n- (0,1)\n- (0,3) [Flagged]\n- (1,1) [Bomb]\n- (1,2)\n- (1,3)\n\nSince we've determined (1,1) is a bomb, and (0,3) is flagged, the remaining adjacent cells:\n\n- (0,1)\n- (1,2)\n- (1,3)\n\nThese cells cannot contain bombs because (0,2) already has one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Action:**\n- Reveal cells (0,1), (1,2), and (1,3).\n\n#### **Position (1,2): '1'**\n\n**Adjacent Cells:**\n- (0,1)\n- (0,2)\n- (0,3) [Flagged]\n- (1,1) [Bomb]\n- (1,3)\n- (2,1)\n- (2,2)\n- (2,3)\n\nGiven that (1,1) is a bomb and (0,3) is flagged, the remaining adjacent cells:\n\n- (0,1)\n- (1,3)\n- (2,1)\n- (2,2)\n- (2,3)\n\nSince (1,2) already has one bomb adjacent, none of these cells can contain bombs.\n\n**Action:**\n- Reveal cells (0,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3).\n\n#### **Position (2,1): '1'**\n\n**Adjacent Cells:**\n- (1,0)\n- (1,1) [Bomb]\n- (1,2)\n- (2,0)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,0)\n- (3,1)\n- (3,2)\n\nGiven that (1,1) is a bomb, the remaining adjacent cells:\n\n- (1,0)\n- (1,2)\n- (2,0)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,0)\n- (3,1)\n- (3,2)\n\nSince (2,1) already has one bomb adjacent, none of these cells can contain bombs.\n\n**Action:**\n- Reveal cells (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\n#### **Position (2,2): '1'**\n\n**Adjacent Cells:**\n- (1,1) [Bomb]\n- (1,2)\n- (1,3)\n- (2,1)\n- (2,3)\n- (3,1)\n- (3,2)\n- (3,3)\n\nGiven that (1,1) is a bomb, the remaining adjacent cells:\n\n- (1,2)\n- (1,3)\n- (2,1)\n- (2,3)\n- (3,1)\n- (3,2)\n- (3,3)\n\nSince (2,2) already has one bomb adjacent, none of these cells can contain bombs.\n\n**Action:**\n- Reveal cells (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3).\n\n### **Consolidating Safe Cells to Reveal**\n\nFrom the above analysis, the safe cells to reveal are:\n\n- **(0,1)**\n- **(1,0)**\n- **(1,2)**\n- **(1,3)**\n- **(2,0)**\n- **(2,1)**\n- **(2,2)**\n- **(2,3)**\n- **(3,0)**\n- **(3,1)**\n- **(3,2)**\n- **(3,3)**\n\nHowever, some of these cells overlap across different positions.

This will provide more information and potentially help us uncover more bombs or safe areas.\n\n**Choosing the Next Safe Cell to Reveal:**\n\nAmong the safe cells identified, let's choose the cell that is most likely to provide the most information upon revealing. Typically, revealing cells that are adjacent to multiple numbers can be more informative.\n\nLooking at the safe cells:\n\n- **Cell (1,2):** Adjacent to (0,2), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\n- **Cell (2,1):** Adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1)\n- **Cell (2,2):** Adjacent to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nThese cells are adjacent to multiple numbers, so revealing them could provide insights into the surrounding cells.\n\nLet's choose **Cell (2,1)** to reveal next.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Revealing (2,1) will give us information about its adjacent cells: (1,0), (1,1) [bomb], (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\n- Since (1,1) is a bomb, revealing (2,1) will show how many bombs are adjacent, which can help us deduce the safety of the remaining adjacent cells.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the next move should be to reveal cell (2,1).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** By deducing that (1,1) is a bomb and analyzing the adjacent numbers, we've identified (2,1) as a safe cell to reveal, which will provide further information to continue solving the Minesweeper puzzle.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,1,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 F . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n2 1 1 1 . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Examining Position (0,2)\n\nThe tile at (0,2) has a `1` and an adjacent flag at (0,3). This means the bomb count adjacent to (0,2) is satisfied by the flag at (0,3). Therefore, we can deduce that all other adjacent squares to (0,2) are safe to reveal.\n\n**Adjacent Squares to (0,2):**\n- (0,1)\n- (1,1)\n- (1,2)\n- (1,3)\n\nSince (1,2) is already a `1`, we'll focus on (0,1), (1,1), and (1,3).\n\n#### 2. Checking Position (1,2)\n\nThe tile at (1,2) shows a `1`. We need to determine its adjacent bombs.\n\n**Adjacent Squares to (1,2):**\n- (0,1)\n- (0,2)\n- (0,3)\n- (1,1)\n- (1,3)\n- (2,1)\n- (2,2)\n- (2,3)\n\nWe know:\n- (0,2) has a `1` with a flag at (0,3), so (0,3) is a bomb.\n  \nTherefore, for (1,2), the bomb count `1` is already satisfied by (0,3). Hence, all other adjacent squares to (1,2) are safe to reveal.\n\n#### 3. Analyzing Position (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2)\n\nThese tiles all show `1`. Let's examine each:\n\n**Position (2,0):**\n**Adjacent Squares:**\n- (1,-1) [Invalid]\n- (1,0)\n- (1,1)\n- (2,1)\n- (3,0)\n- (3,1)\n\nWe need to determine if there's a bomb among these. Since (2,0) shows `1`, there must be exactly one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Position (2,1):**\n**Adjacent Squares:**\n- (1,0)\n- (1,1)\n- (1,2)\n- (2,0)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,0)\n- (3,1)\n- (3,2)\n\nIt also shows `1`, so there's exactly one bomb among these.\n\n**Position (2,2):**\n**Adjacent Squares:**\n- (1,1)\n- (1,2)\n- (1,3)\n- (2,1)\n- (2,3)\n- (3,1)\n- (3,2)\n- (3,3)\n\nShows `1`, so one bomb adjacent.\n\nFrom earlier deductions:\n- (0,3) is a bomb, which is adjacent to (1,2) but not directly to (2,1) or (2,2).\n\nTherefore, we need to find the bomb adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).\n\nLooking at the common adjacent squares:\n- (1,1) is adjacent to all three.\n\nIf (1,1) were a bomb:\n- It would satisfy the `1` for (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).\n  \nTherefore, (1,1) must be a bomb.\n\n#### 4. Placing a Flag at (1,1)\n\nBased on the above deduction, (1,1) must be a bomb. Therefore, we should place a flag there.\n\n**Verification:**\n- **Position (2,0):** Adjacent to (1,1), which is now flagged as a bomb. This satisfies its `1`.\n- **Position (2,1):** Adjacent to (1,1), satisfying its `1`.\n- **Position (2,2):** Adjacent to (1,1), satisfying its `1`.\n  \nThis placement does not conflict with any existing numbers or flags.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the revealed numbers and the existing flag, we deduced that the square at (1,1) must contain a bomb. Placing a flag there satisfies all adjacent numbered tiles without any conflicts.\n\n**Final Move:**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The tile at (1,1) is determined to be a bomb based on the adjacent numbers `1` at positions (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).

Safe.\n  \n- **Tile (1,2):** Adjacent to (1,1) which is flagged and (1,3) which needs further analysis.\n  \n- **Tile (1,3):** Needs further analysis.\n  \n- **Tile (2,1):** Adjacent to (1,1) which is flagged. Safe.\n  \n- **Tile (2,2):** Adjacent to (1,1) which is flagged. Safe.\n  \n- **Tile (2,3):** Needs further analysis.\n  \n- **Tile (3,0):** Adjacent to (2,0) which shows '1' with a flag at (1,1). Safe.\n  \n- **Tile (3,1):** Adjacent to (2,1) which shows '1' with a flag at (1,1). Safe.\n  \n- **Tile (3,2):** Adjacent to (2,2) which shows '1' with a flag at (1,1). Safe.\n  \n- **Tile (3,3):** Needs further analysis.\n\n**Potential Bomb Tiles:**\n\n- **Tile (1,3):** Adjacent to (1,2) which shows '1' with a flag at (1,1). Since (1,2) shows '1' and has one adjacent flag at (1,1), (1,3) is safe.\n  \n- **Tile (2,3):** Needs to be adjacent to exactly one bomb.\n  \n- **Tile (2,4):** Shows '2' with one flag at (1,5). One more bomb is needed adjacent.\n  \n- **Tile (3,3):** Adjacent to (2,3) which shows '1'. Needs to be a bomb to satisfy (2,3)'s count.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n\n- **Tile (3,3):** Must be a bomb to satisfy the '1' at (2,3).\n  \n- **Tile (2,4):** Already has one flag at (1,5). The '2' count requires one more bomb adjacent. Since (3,3) is already a bomb, (2,4) is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, we can safely place a flag at (3,3).\n\n### **Final Decision and Next Move**\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the current board state, I determined that tile (3,3) must be a bomb to satisfy the '1' count at tile (2,3). There are no conflicts with existing flags, and placing a flag here aligns with the critical flag placement rules.\n\n**MOVE:** 3,3,true\n\nThis move involves placing a flag at coordinates (3,3) to mark it as a suspected bomb, ensuring the integrity of the game's number clues and progressing toward safely revealing the remaining tiles.", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 F 2 . . . . .\n1 _ F 1 1 2 F . . . .\n2 1 1 1 1 2 . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

This is a conflict.\n\n**Conflict Identified:**\n- At position (1,3), the number '1' has two adjacent flags, which violates the rule that the number should equal the number of adjacent bombs.\n\n### Resolving the Conflict\n\nGiven the conflict at (1,3), we need to determine which of the adjacent flags is incorrectly placed.\n\n**Adjacent Flags to (1,3):**\n1. **Flag at (0,3):**\n   - Let's check if this flag is necessary.\n   - Adjacent to (0,2): '1' with flag at (0,3) \u2013 acceptable.\n   - Adjacent to (1,3): '1' \u2013 conflict arises here.\n   \n2. **Flag at (1,4):**\n   - Adjacent to (0,4): '2' with flags at (0,3) and (1,4) \u2013 acceptable.\n   \nSince the flag at (0,3) is causing a conflict with the '1' at (1,3), it's likely that this flag is incorrectly placed.\n\n### Verifying the Flag at (0,3)\n\nLet's examine the implications of removing the flag at (0,3):\n\n1. **Position (0,2): '1'**\n   - Without the flag at (0,3), the adjacent squares to (0,2) are:\n     - (0,1): Unexplored\n     - (0,3): Now unexplored\n     - (1,1): Flagged\n     - (1,2): Unexplored\n     - (1,3): '1'\n   - Since there's still a flag at (1,1), which is adjacent to (0,2), the '1' is satisfied by that flag alone.\n\n2. **Position (0,4): '2'**\n   - Adjacent flags: (0,3) removed, (1,4) remains.\n   - Now, only one flag adjacent to '2', but the number is '2'. This means there must be another bomb adjacent.\n\n3. **Position (1,3): '1'**\n   - After removing the flag at (0,3), the adjacent squares to (1,3) are:\n     - (0,2): '1'\n     - (0,3): Now unexplored\n     - (0,4): '2'\n     - (1,2): '1'\n     - (1,4): Flagged\n     - (2,2): '1'\n     - (2,3): '1'\n     - (2,4): '2'\n   - The flag at (1,4) satisfies the '1', so no other bombs should be adjacent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Removing the flag at (0,3) resolves the conflict at (1,3) and maintains consistency with other numbers.\n\n### Determining the Next Move\n\nGiven the analysis, the next logical step is to remove the incorrectly placed flag at (0,3).\n\n**Move:**\n- **x, y:** 0, 3\n- **flag:** true (since we're removing a flag by toggling it)\n\n### Final Answer\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The flag at (0,3) causes a conflict with the '1' at (1,3), which indicates that there should only be one adjacent bomb, but currently, there are two adjacent flags.

This means there must be one bomb among the unexplored adjacent squares: (3,0) and (4,2).\n\n**Potential Bomb Locations:** (3,0) and (4,2)\n\n### Step 2: Look for obvious conflicts\n\nFrom the above analysis, we have identified conflicts at positions (0,2), (1,2), and (2,2). Each of these positions has a number '1' but is adjacent to two flags, which is impossible.\n\n**Conflict Resolution:** Since a number '1' cannot have two adjacent bombs, at least one of the adjacent flags must be incorrect.\n\nLet's examine the flags at (1,1) and (1,3):\n\n- **Flag at (1,1):** Adjacent to numbers at (0,2), (1,2), and (2,1).\n  - (0,2): Number '1' with two adjacent flags (conflict)\n  - (1,2): Number '1' with two adjacent flags (conflict)\n  - (2,1): Number '1' with one adjacent flag (no conflict)\n\n- **Flag at (1,3):** Adjacent to numbers at (0,2), (1,2), (1,4), and (2,3).\n  - (0,2): Number '1' with two adjacent flags (conflict)\n  - (1,2): Number '1' with two adjacent flags (conflict)\n  - (1,4): Number '2' with two adjacent flags (no conflict)\n  - (2,3): Number '1' with one adjacent flag (no conflict)\n\nGiven that both flags at (1,1) and (1,3) are causing conflicts with multiple numbers, it's clear that at least one of these flags is incorrectly placed.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\n\nTotal bombs: 10\nFlags placed: 6\nFlags remaining: 6\n\nSince we have placed 6 flags and there are 10 bombs, we still have 4 bombs to flag. However, given the conflicts identified, it's essential to correct the existing flags before placing new ones.\n\n### Step 4: Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile\n\nGiven the conflicts, the priority is to resolve the incorrect flags. Let's consider removing one of the conflicting flags to see if it resolves the issues.\n\n**Option 1: Remove flag at (1,1)**\n- This would resolve the conflicts at (0,2) and (1,2).\n- However, the number '1' at (2,1) would then have no adjacent flags, meaning there must be a bomb at one of its adjacent unexplored squares: (1,0) or (2,0). But (1,0) is already revealed as empty, so the bomb must be at (2,0). However, (2,0) is already revealed as a number '1', which is a conflict.\n\n**Option 2: Remove flag at (1,3)**\n- This would resolve the conflicts at (0,2) and (1,2).\n- The number '1' at (2,3) would still have one adjacent flag at (3,3), which is correct.\n- The number '2' at (1,4) would then have only one adjacent flag at (1,5), meaning there must be another bomb adjacent to (1,4). The unexplored adjacent squares are (0,3) and (0,5).\n\nRemoving the flag at (1,3) seems to be the better option as it resolves the immediate conflicts without introducing new ones.\n\n**Next Move: Remove the flag at (1,3)**\n\nEXPLANATION: Removing the flag at (1,3) resolves the conflicts at (0,2) and (1,2) where the number '1' had two adjacent flags. This action aligns the numbers with the correct number of adjacent bombs.\n\nMOVE: 1,3,true (Note: To remove a flag, we set flag=true on an already flagged square)", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . 2 . . . . .\n1 _ F 1 F 2 F . . . .\n2 1 1 1 1 2 . . . . .\n3 . 1 1 F . . . . . .\n4 1 1 1 . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

There's already a flag at (1,1), which should be the bomb adjacent to (0,2). Therefore, no other adjacent squares should contain bombs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe unexplored tile at (0,3) must be safe since the bomb count at (0,2) is already satisfied by the flag at (1,1).\n\n#### Tile (0,4): Value = 2\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,3): `.` (unexplored)\n- (0,5): `.` (unexplored)\n- (1,3): `1`\n- (1,4): `2`\n- (1,5): `F` (flagged)\n\n**Analysis:**\nTile (0,4) indicates two adjacent bombs. There's already a flag at (1,5), which accounts for one bomb. Therefore, there must be one more bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles: (0,3) or (0,5).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOne of the tiles (0,3) or (0,5) must contain a bomb. However, from the earlier analysis of (0,2), we determined that (0,3) is safe. Therefore, (0,5) must be the bomb.\n\n#### Tile (1,2): Value = 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,1): `_` (empty)\n- (0,2): `1`\n- (0,3): `.` (unexplored)\n- (1,1): `F` (flagged)\n- (1,3): `1`\n- (2,1): `1`\n- (2,2): `1`\n- (2,3): `1`\n\n**Analysis:**\nTile (1,2) has one adjacent bomb. There's already a flag at (1,1), which should be the bomb adjacent to (1,2). Therefore, no other adjacent squares should contain bombs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe unexplored tile at (0,3) must be safe, consistent with our earlier deduction.\n\n#### Tile (1,3): Value = 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,2): `1`\n- (0,3): `.` (unexplored)\n- (0,4): `2`\n- (1,2): `1`\n- (1,4): `2`\n- (2,2): `1`\n- (2,3): `1`\n- (2,4): `2`\n\n**Analysis:**\nTile (1,3) indicates one adjacent bomb. From earlier analysis, the bomb is likely at (0,5). However, (0,5) is not adjacent to (1,3). Therefore, we need to reassess.\n\nLooking back, tile (0,3) is adjacent to (1,3) and was determined to be safe. The only other adjacent unexplored tile is (0,4), but tile (0,4) itself has a value of `2` and is adjacent to (1,3). Wait, (0,4) is already revealed as `2` and is not unexplored.\n\nWait, let's correct this. The adjacent unexplored tiles to (1,3) are:\n\nActually, looking back:\n\nAdjacent squares to (1,3):\n- (0,2): `1`\n- (0,3): `.` (unexplored)\n- (0,4): `2`\n- (1,2): `1`\n- (1,4): `2`\n- (2,2): `1`\n- (2,3): `1`\n- (2,4): `2`\n\nOnly (0,3) is unexplored. Since (1,3) requires one adjacent bomb and there's no flag adjacent to it, (0,3) must contain a bomb.\n\nWait, but earlier we determined that (0,3) is safe based on tile (0,2). There seems to be a contradiction.\n\n**Re-evaluating:**\nFrom tile (0,2) with value `1` and adjacent flag at (1,1), we concluded that (0,3) is safe.\n\nNow, tile (1,3) also has value `1` and is adjacent to (0,3). If (0,3) is safe, then tile (1,3) should not have any adjacent bombs, which contradicts its value of `1`.\n\n**Resolution:**\nThis indicates that our earlier assumption that (0,3) is safe may be incorrect. Let's re-examine tile (0,2).\n\n#### Re-examining Tile (0,2): Value = 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,1): `_` (empty)\n- (0,3): `.` (unexplored)\n- (1,1): `F` (flagged)\n- (1,2): `1`\n- (1,3): `1`\n\n**Revised Analysis:**\nTile (0,2) has one adjacent bomb. The flag at (1,1) should be that bomb. Therefore, (0,3) should indeed be safe.\n\nBut this contradicts the analysis of tile (1,3). Therefore, there might be an error in our initial deductions.\n\n**Possible Misinterpretation:**\nPerhaps the flag at (1,1) is incorrectly placed. Let's check if the flag at (1,1) is justified.\n\n#### Checking Flag at (1,1)\n\nAdjacent to flag (1,1):\n- (0,0): `_`\n- (0,1): `_`\n- (0,2): `1`\n- (1,0): `_`\n- (1,2): `1`\n- (2,0): `1`\n- (2,1): `1`\n- (2,2): `1`\n\n**Analysis:**\nLet's see if the flag at (1,1) is necessary.\n\nTile (0,2) has value `1` and is adjacent to flag (1,1), which satisfies the bomb count. Therefore, the flag at (1,1) seems justified.\n\nTile (1,2) has value `1` and is also adjacent to flag (1,1), which satisfies its bomb count.\n\nTile (2,1) has value `1` and is adjacent to flag (1,1), satisfying its bomb count.\n\nTherefore, the flag at (1,1) is correctly placed and serves as the bomb for tiles (0,2), (1,2), and (2,1).\n\nGiven this, our earlier deduction that (0,3) is safe based on tile (0,2) still holds.\n\n**Re-examining Tile (1,3): Value = 1**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,2): `1`\n- (0,3): `.` (unexplored)\n- (0,4): `2`\n- (1,2): `1`\n- (1,4): `2`\n- (2,2): `1`\n- (2,3): `1`\n- (2,4): `2`\n\n**Revised Analysis:**\nTile (1,3) indicates one adjacent bomb. The only unexplored adjacent tile is (0,3). However, we've determined that (0,3) is safe based on tile (0,2). This presents a contradiction.\n\n**Possible Resolution:**\nThere might be an error in our initial assumption. Let's consider that perhaps (0,3) is not safe and contains a bomb.\n\nIf (0,3) is a bomb:\n- It satisfies the bomb count for tile (1,3).\n- However, it contradicts the analysis of tile (0,2), which already has its bomb count satisfied by the flag at (1,1).\n\nThis suggests that our initial deductions may be flawed. Let's try a different approach.\n\n### Step 2: Looking for Obvious Conflicts\n\nLet's scan the board for any numbers that have too many or too few adjacent flags, which would indicate a conflict.\n\n#### Tile (1,4): Value = 2\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,3): `.` (unexplored)\n- (0,4): `2`\n- (0,5): `.` (unexplored)\n- (1,3): `1`\n- (1,5): `F` (flagged)\n- (2,3): `1`\n- (2,4): `2`\n- (2,5): `.` (unexplored)\n\n**Analysis:**\nTile (1,4) indicates two adjacent bombs. There's already a flag at (1,5), which accounts for one bomb. Therefore, there must be one more bomb among the adjacent unexplored tiles: (0,3), (0,5), or (2,5).\n\nFrom earlier analysis, we have conflicting information about (0,3). Let's see if we can find more clues.\n\n#### Tile (0,4): Value = 2\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,3): `.` (unexplored)\n- (0,5): `.` (unexplored)\n- (1,3): `1`\n- (1,4): `2`\n- (1,5): `F` (flagged)\n\n**Analysis:**\nTile (0,4) indicates two adjacent bombs. There's already a flag at (1,5), which accounts for one bomb. Therefore, there must be one more bomb among the adjacent unexplored tiles: (0,3) or (0,5).\n\nThis aligns with our earlier deduction for tile (1,4). Both tiles (0,4) and (1,4) suggest that one of (0,3) or (0,5) is a bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEither (0,3) or (0,5) contains a bomb. However, from tile (0,2), we had deduced that (0,3) is safe. This suggests that (0,5) must be the bomb.\n\nBut wait, earlier we thought (0,3) was safe based on tile (0,2), but that led to a contradiction with tile (1,3). Therefore, perhaps (0,3) is indeed a bomb.\n\nLet's explore this possibility.\n\n### Step 3: Resolving the Contradiction\n\nAssuming (0,3) is a bomb:\n\n1. **Tile (0,2):** Value = 1; adjacent bomb at (1,1) already satisfies the count. Therefore, (0,3) being a bomb would exceed the count. This is a conflict.\n\n2. **Tile (1,3):** Value = 1; adjacent bomb at (0,3) satisfies the count.\n\nThis indicates that if (0,3) is a bomb, tile (0,2) would have two adjacent bombs, which contradicts its value of `1`.\n\nTherefore, (0,3) cannot be a bomb.\n\n**Reaffirming:**\nThus, (0,3) must be safe, and (0,5) must be the bomb to satisfy the counts for tiles (0,4) and (1,4).\n\nBut earlier, we saw that if (0,3) is safe, tile (1,3) would have zero adjacent bombs, contradicting its value of `1`.\n\nThis suggests that there's an inconsistency in the current board state, possibly due to an incorrect flag placement.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying Flag Placement\n\nLet's re-examine the flag at (1,5):\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,4): `2`\n- (0,5): `.` (unexplored)\n- (0,6): `.` (unexplored)\n- (1,4): `2`\n- (1,6): `.` (unexplored)\n- (2,4): `2`\n- (2,5): `.` (unexplored)\n- (2,6): `.` (unexplored)\n\n**Analysis:**\nTile (1,4) has value `2` and is adjacent to flag (1,5), which accounts for one bomb. Therefore, there must be one more bomb among the adjacent unexplored tiles: (0,5) or (2,5).\n\nTile (0,4) also has value `2` and is adjacent to flag (1,5), requiring one more bomb among (0,5) or (0,3). However, we've determined that (0,3) is safe, so (0,5) must be the bomb.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that assuming (0,5) is a bomb leads to tile (1,3) having zero adjacent bombs, which contradicts its value of `1`.\n\nThis suggests that the flag at (1,5) might be incorrectly placed.\n\n### Step 5: Considering Removing the Flag at (1,5)\n\nIf we remove the flag at (1,5):\n\n- **Tile (1,4):** Value = 2; now needs two adjacent bombs among (0,3), (0,5), (2,5). We've determined (0,3) is safe, so bombs must be at (0,5) and (2,5).\n\n- **Tile (0,4):** Value = 2; needs two adjacent bombs among (0,3) and (0,5). Since (0,3) is safe, (0,5) must be a bomb, and another bomb must be adjacent, but only (0,5) is available. This suggests that removing the flag at (1,5) may not resolve the issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag at (1,5) is correctly placed, and our earlier deduction that (0,3) is safe is incorrect. But as we saw, assuming (0,3) is a bomb leads to a conflict with tile (0,2).\n\nThis suggests that there might be a deeper inconsistency in the board state, possibly due to an earlier incorrect move.\n\n### Step 6: Exploring Alternative Approaches\n\nGiven the contradictions arising from our deductions, let's try a different approach by examining other parts of the board where we can make safe moves or place flags confidently.\n\n#### Tile (2,4): Value = 2\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (1,3): `1`\n- (1,4): `2`\n- (1,5): `F` (flagged)\n- (2,3): `1`\n- (2,5): `.` (unexplored)\n- (3,3): `F` (flagged)\n- (3,4): `.` (unexplored)\n- (3,5): `.` (unexplored)\n\n**Analysis:**\nTile (2,4) indicates two adjacent bombs. There's already a flag at (1,5) and (3,3), which accounts for two bombs. Therefore, no other adjacent squares should contain bombs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe unexplored tiles at (2,5), (3,4), and (3,5) must be safe.\n\n#### Tile (3,3): Flagged as F\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (2,2): `1`\n- (2,3): `1`\n- (2,4): `2`\n- (3,2): `1`\n- (3,4): `.` (unexplored)\n- (4,2): `1`\n- (4,3): `1`\n- (4,4): `.` (unexplored)\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe flag at (3,3) should satisfy the bomb count for adjacent tiles.\n\nLet's check:\n\n- Tile (2,3): Value = 1; adjacent bomb at (3,3) satisfies the count.\n  \n- Tile (3,2): Value = 1; adjacent bomb at (3,3) satisfies the count.\n  \n- Tile (4,3): Value = 1; adjacent bomb at (3,3) satisfies the count.\n\nTherefore, the flag at (3,3) is correctly placed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe flag at (3,3) is justified and should remain.\n\n### Step 7: Identifying Safe Moves\n\nFrom our analysis of tile (2,4), we've determined that tiles (2,5), (3,4), and (3,5) are safe to reveal.\n\n**Move Suggestion:**\nReveal tile (2,5), (3,4), or (3,5).\n\nLet's proceed with revealing tile (2,5).\n\n### Step 8: Making the Move\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\nAfter analyzing the board, tile (2,5) is determined to be safe based on the bomb count of adjacent tiles, especially considering the flags at (1,5) and (3,3).

From the above analysis, all numbers seem consistent with their adjacent flags.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\n\nThere are 10 bombs in total, and 6 flags have already been placed. This means there are 4 bombs left to be flagged.\n\n### Step 4: Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile\n\nNow, I'll look for positions where I can confidently place a flag or reveal a safe tile.\n\n**Position (0,4)**: Shows '2' and has one adjacent flag at (0,5). There must be one more bomb adjacent to (0,4). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,3), (1,3), and (1,4). Since (1,4) also shows '2' and has one adjacent flag at (1,5), it's likely that (1,4) has a bomb. Therefore, I can place a flag at (1,4).\n\n**Position (1,6)**: Shows '2' and has one adjacent flag at (1,5). There must be one more bomb adjacent to (1,6). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,6), and (2,7). Since (0,6) shows '1' and has no adjacent flags, it's likely that (0,6) has a bomb. Therefore, I can place a flag at (0,6).\n\n**Position (2,4)**: Shows '2' and has no adjacent flags. There must be two bombs adjacent to (2,4). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5). Since (1,4) is already flagged, and (1,5) is flagged, the remaining bombs must be among (1,3), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5). This is more complex, so I'll hold off on placing a flag here.\n\n**Position (2,6)**: Shows '2' and has no adjacent flags. There must be two bombs adjacent to (2,6). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), and (3,7). Since (1,5) is flagged, and (1,6) is flagged, the remaining bombs must be among (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), and (3,7). This is also complex, so I'll hold off on placing a flag here.\n\n**Position (7,3)**: Shows '2' and has no adjacent flags. There must be two bombs adjacent to (7,3). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), and (8,4). Since (7,4) shows '2' and has no adjacent flags, it's likely that (7,4) has a bomb. Therefore, I can place a flag at (7,4).\n\n**Position (7,4)**: Shows '2' and has no adjacent flags. There must be two bombs adjacent to (7,4). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), and (8,5). Since (7,3) shows '2' and has no adjacent flags, it's likely that (7,3) has a bomb. Therefore, I can place a flag at (7,3).\n\n**Position (8,6)**: Shows '2' and has no adjacent flags. There must be two bombs adjacent to (8,6). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), and (9,7). Since (8,7) shows '1' and has no adjacent flags, it's likely that (8,7) has a bomb. Therefore, I can place a flag at (8,7).\n\n**Position (9,7)**: Shows '1' and has no adjacent flags. There must be one bomb adjacent to (9,7). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9,6), and (9,8). Since (8,7) is already flagged, there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (9,7). Therefore, I can reveal the adjacent tiles.\n\n### Step 5: Make the move\n\nBased on the above analysis, the most confident move is to place a flag at (1,4) because it satisfies the condition for position (0,4) and (1,4).\n\n**EXPLANATION**: Position (1,4) must contain a bomb to satisfy the '2' at (0,4) and (1,4) with one adjacent flag each.\n\n**MOVE**: 1,4,true", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . 2 F 1 _ _ _\n1 _ F 1 1 2 F 2 1 1 _\n2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 . 1 _\n3 . 1 1 F 1 _ 1 1 1 _\n4 1 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 2 2 1 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 1 _ _\n9 . . . . . . . 1 _ _", "sucess": true}

The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,1): _\n- (0,3): .\n- (1,1): F (Flag)\n- (1,2): 1\n- (1,3): 1\n\nThere's already one flag at (1,1), which means there's one bomb adjacent to (0,2). Since the number is '1', there can't be any more bombs adjacent to it. Therefore, squares (0,1), (0,3), (1,2), and (1,3) are safe to reveal.\n\n### Step 4: Looking for Obvious Conflicts\n\nNext, I'll look for any obvious conflicts where a number has more flags than it should or fewer flags than indicated.\n\n**Example Conflict Check:**\n\nConsider (1,6) which is '2'. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,5): F (Flag)\n- (0,6): 1\n- (1,5): F (Flag)\n- (1,7): 1\n- (2,5): 1\n- (2,6): 2\n\nThere are two flags at (0,5) and (1,5). Since the number is '2', these two flags satisfy the bomb count. Therefore, the remaining adjacent squares should be safe.\n\n### Step 5: Considering Remaining Flags and Bombs\n\nThere are 10 bombs on the board and 5 flags remaining. I need to ensure that each flag I place is justified by the numbers revealed.\n\n### Step 6: Deciding the Next Move\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I've identified a safe move based on the number '1' at (0,2). Since there's already one flag at (1,1), the adjacent squares (0,1) and (0,3) must be safe.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nI'll reveal the square at (0,1) since it's adjacent to a '1' with a flag already placed, ensuring it's safe.\n\n```\nEXPLANATION: The square at (0,1) is adjacent to a '1' at (0,2) which already has a flag at (1,1), indicating that (0,1) must be safe to reveal.\nMOVE: 0,1,false\n```", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . 2 F 1 _ _ _\n1 _ F 1 1 F F 2 1 1 _\n2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 . 1 _\n3 . 1 1 F 1 _ 1 1 1 _\n4 1 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 2 2 1 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 1 _ _\n9 . . . . . . . 1 _ _", "sucess": true}

For example, if a tile shows '1' but has two adjacent flags, that's a conflict.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\n\nThere are 5 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total.

Since (0,5) is already flagged, the remaining bomb must be among (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), or (1,5).\n\n**Tile (1,6):** Shows '2' and has one adjacent flag at (1,5). This means there must be one more bomb adjacent to (1,6). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), and (2,7). Since (1,5) is already flagged, the remaining bomb must be among (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), or (2,7).\n\n**Tile (2,6):** Shows '2' and has no adjacent flags.

The adjacent unexplored tiles are (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), and (4,8). Since (2,6) shows '2' and has no adjacent flags, it's likely that one of the bombs adjacent to (3,7) is also adjacent to (2,6).\n\n**Tile (4,4):** Shows '1' and has no adjacent flags. This means there is one bomb adjacent to (4,4). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5). Since (3,3) is already flagged, the remaining bomb must be among (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), or (5,5).\n\n**Tile (7,3):** Shows '2' and has no adjacent flags. This means there are two bombs adjacent to (7,3). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), and (8,4).\n\n**Tile (8,6):** Shows '2' and has no adjacent flags. This means there are two bombs adjacent to (8,6). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), and (9,7).\n\n**Tile (9,7):** Shows '1' and has no adjacent flags. This means there is one bomb adjacent to (9,7). The adjacent unexplored tiles are (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9,6), and (9,8).\n\n### Decision Making:\n\nFrom the above analysis, the safest move is to reveal a tile that is guaranteed to be safe. Looking at tile (0,2), which shows '1' and has one adjacent flag at (0,5), the adjacent tiles (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) are safe to reveal.\n\nAmong these, tile (0,1) is unexplored and adjacent to (0,2). Since (0,2) already has one adjacent flag, there are no bombs adjacent to (0,1). Therefore, revealing (0,1) is a safe move.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (0,2) shows '1' with one adjacent flag at (0,5), so the adjacent tile (0,1) is safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,1,false", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . 2 F 1 _ _ _\n1 _ F 1 1 F F 2 1 1 _\n2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 . 1 _\n3 . 1 1 F 1 _ 1 1 1 _\n4 1 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 2 2 1 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 1 _ _\n9 . . . . . . . 1 _ _", "sucess": true}

This means that for every numbered tile, the count of adjacent flags should match the number displayed.\n\n- **Tile (0,2) = 1**: Adjacent to flag at (0,5). This is correct since there's exactly one flag adjacent.\n- **Tile (0,4) = 2**: Adjacent to flag at (0,5). There should be one more bomb adjacent to this tile.\n- **Tile (0,6) = 1**: Adjacent to flag at (0,5). This is correct.\n- **Tile (1,2) = 1**: Adjacent to flag at (1,1). This is correct.\n- **Tile (1,6) = 2**: Adjacent to flags at (1,4) and (1,5). This is correct.\n- **Tile (2,6) = 2**: Adjacent to flag at (1,5). There should be one more bomb adjacent.\n- **Tile (3,3) = F**: This is a flag, so we don't need to check it.\n- **Tile (3,7) = 1**: Adjacent to flag at (3,3). This is correct.\n- **Tile (7,3) = 2**: Adjacent to no flags. There should be two bombs adjacent.\n- **Tile (7,4) = 2**: Adjacent to no flags. There should be two bombs adjacent.\n- **Tile (7,5) = 1**: Adjacent to no flags. There should be one bomb adjacent.\n- **Tile (8,6) = 2**: Adjacent to no flags. There should be two bombs adjacent.\n- **Tile (8,7) = 1**: Adjacent to no flags. There should be one bomb adjacent.\n- **Tile (9,7) = 1**: Adjacent to no flags. There should be one bomb adjacent.\n\n### Step 2: Look for obvious conflicts\n\nI don't see any obvious conflicts where a number has more adjacent flags than its value. All the numbers seem to be consistent with the flags placed so far.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\n\nThere are 10 bombs in total, and 5 flags have already been placed. This means there are 5 bombs left to flag.\n\n### Step 4: Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile\n\nNow, I'll look for tiles where I can confidently place a flag or reveal a safe tile.\n\n**Tile (0,4) = 2**: Adjacent to flag at (0,5). There should be one more bomb adjacent. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,3), (1,3), and (1,4). However, (1,4) is already flagged, so the remaining bomb must be at either (0,3) or (1,3).\n\n**Tile (2,6) = 2**: Adjacent to flag at (1,5). There should be one more bomb adjacent. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,6), and (3,7). However, (1,6) is already a '2' with two adjacent flags, so it's safe. (3,7) is a '1' with one adjacent flag, so it's safe. The remaining unexplored tiles are (1,7), (2,7), and (3,6).\n\n**Tile (7,3) = 2**: Adjacent to no flags. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), and (8,4). This is a bit too broad to make a confident move.\n\n**Tile (7,4) = 2**: Adjacent to no flags. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), and (8,5). Again, too broad.\n\n**Tile (7,5) = 1**: Adjacent to no flags. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), and (8,6). Still too broad.\n\n**Tile (8,6) = 2**: Adjacent to no flags. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), and (9,7). Too broad.\n\n**Tile (8,7) = 1**: Adjacent to no flags. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), and (9,8). Too broad.\n\n**Tile (9,7) = 1**: Adjacent to no flags. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9,6), and (9,8). Still too broad.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the most promising area to make a move is around **Tile (0,4) = 2**. Since there's already one flag adjacent at (0,5), there must be one more bomb adjacent. The possible locations are (0,3) and (1,3).\n\nLooking at **Tile (1,3) = 1**: It's adjacent to flag at (1,1). Since it's a '1' with one adjacent flag, there cannot be another bomb adjacent to it. Therefore, the bomb must be at (0,3).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (0,4) shows '2' with one adjacent flag at (0,5). The remaining bomb must be at (0,3) because (1,3) is adjacent to a '1' tile that already has one flag, leaving no room for another bomb.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,3,true", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . 2 F 1 _ _ _\n1 _ F 1 1 F F 2 1 1 _\n2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 . 1 _\n3 . 1 1 F 1 _ 1 1 1 _\n4 1 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 2 2 1 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 1 _ _\n9 . . . . . . . 1 _ _", "sucess": true}

This is correct since the number `1` indicates exactly one adjacent bomb, and there's already one flag.\n  \n- **Tile (0,4):** Displays `2` and has two adjacent flags at (0,3) and (0,5). This is correct as it matches the number `2`.\n\n- **Tile (1,1):** Displays `F` (Flagged). We'll verify if this flag is correctly placed by checking adjacent tiles.\n\n**Potential Conflict:**\n\n- **Tile (2,7):** Displays `.` (Unexplored). Let's investigate further.\n\n#### **Step 2: Identifying Obvious Conflicts**\n\nWe need to ensure that no revealed number has more adjacent flags than the number displayed.\n\n**Example:**\n\n- **Tile (2,6):** Displays `2`. Adjacent tiles include (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,6), and (3,7). Currently, there are no adjacent flags, so we need to determine if this tile requires more flags.\n\n#### **Step 3: Considering Remaining Flags and Bombs**\n\nWith 4 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total, we have to strategically place flags where we're confident there's a bomb.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Tile (3,3):** Displays `F` (Flagged). Adjacent tiles include (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4). The number at (3,2) is `1`, which already has one adjacent flag at (3,3). Therefore, there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (3,2).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on this analysis, the flag at (3,3) is correctly placed, and we can deduce that the adjacent unexplored tiles around (3,2) are safe to reveal.\n\n#### **Step 4: Deciding the Next Move**\n\nGiven the above analysis, the most strategic move is to reveal a tile that is confirmed to be safe.\n\n**Safe Tile:**\n\n- **Tile (3,2):** Already revealed with a `1`, and it has one adjacent flag at (3,3). Therefore, other adjacent tiles like (2,2), (2,3), (4,2), and (4,3) should be safe to reveal.\n\n**Optimal Move:**\n\nGiven that (4,3) is unexplored and adjacent to (3,2), which already has its required bomb flagged, revealing (4,3) is a safe move.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (4,3) is adjacent to (3,2), which has a `1` and an already flagged bomb at (3,3).

The adjacent unexplored squares are (1,6), (1,7), (3,6), and (3,7). Since (1,6) is `2` and already has one bomb adjacent at (1,5), it is safe to reveal (1,7). The bomb could be at (3,6) or (3,7). We need to look for more clues.\n   - At (3,6), it is unexplored (`.`). Since (3,5) is `1` and has no adjacent flags, it is safe to reveal.\n   - At (3,7), it is unexplored (`.`). Since (3,6) is `1` and has no adjacent flags, it is safe to reveal.\n\n4. **Next Move:**\n   - The safest move is to reveal an unexplored square with no adjacent numbers requiring a bomb. The best candidate is (0,0).\n\n### EXPLANATION:\nThe square at (0,0) is unexplored and has no adjacent numbers requiring a bomb. Revealing it is safe and will provide more information for further moves.\n\n### MOVE:\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 F 2 F 1 _ _ _\n1 _ F 1 F F F 2 1 1 _\n2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 . 1 _\n3 . 1 1 F 1 _ 1 1 1 _\n4 1 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 2 2 1 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 1 _ _\n9 . . . . . . . 1 _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "### Step 1: Checking Revealed Numbers Against Existing Flags\n\nFirst, I'll scan the board to see if there are any numbered tiles where the number of adjacent flags already matches the number on the tile. This means there can't be any more bombs adjacent to that number.\n\nLooking at tile (0,2), which shows '1', and it has one adjacent flag at (0,3). Therefore, all adjacent squares except (0,3) must be safe. Similarly, tile (0,4) shows '2' with one adjacent flag at (0,5). This means there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to (0,4).\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Obvious Conflicts\n\nNext, I'll check for any conflicts where a numbered tile has more adjacent flags than its number indicates. For instance, if a tile shows '1' but has two adjacent flags, that would be a conflict.\n\nUpon reviewing the board, I don't see any such conflicts. All flagged tiles adjacent to numbers seem to be in line with the numbers displayed.\n\n### Step 3: Considering Remaining Flags vs. Bombs\n\nThere are 10 bombs in total, and currently, 3 flags have been placed. This means there are still 7 bombs left to be flagged.\n\n### Step 4: Deciding the Next Move\n\nNow, I'll look for a tile where I can either safely reveal a square or place a new flag without causing conflicts.\n\nLooking at tile (0,4), which shows '2' and has one adjacent flag at (0,5), there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent unexplored squares are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5). However, (0,5) is already flagged, so the remaining adjacent squares are (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).\n\nSince (0,3) is already flagged, we can eliminate it. Now, among (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5), exactly one must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at tile (1,6), which shows '2', and it has one adjacent flag at (1,1). Therefore, there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to (1,6). The adjacent unexplored squares are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), and (2,7). However, (0,5) is already flagged, so we can eliminate it. Now, among (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), and (2,7), exactly one must be a bomb.\n\nNow, let's focus on tile (2,7), which shows '1', and it has no adjacent flags. Therefore, exactly one of its adjacent unexplored squares must be a bomb. The adjacent unexplored squares are (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), and (3,8). But (1,6) is already revealed as '2', so we can focus on (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), and (3,8).\n\nGiven the complexity, it might be safer to reveal a tile that is definitely safe to minimize the risk of hitting a bomb.\n\nLooking at tile (3,0), which is unexplored and adjacent to tile (3,1) showing '1'. Since (3,1) has no adjacent flags, and (3,0) is unexplored, it's a good candidate to reveal.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe revealing tile (3,0) is the safest move at this stage, as it's adjacent to a '1' with no flags, reducing the risk of encountering a bomb.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Revealing tile (3,0) is a safe move as it's adjacent to a '1' with no adjacent flags, ensuring it's not a bomb.\n\n**MOVE:** 3,0,false", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 F 2 F 1 _ _ _\n1 _ F 1 F F F 2 1 1 _\n2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 . 1 _\n3 . 1 1 F 1 _ 1 1 1 _\n4 1 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 2 2 1 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 1 _ _\n9 . . . . . . . 1 _ _", "sucess": false}
