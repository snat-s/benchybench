Similarly, there should be no other bombs adjacent to (2,3).\n\n**Checking (4,2):** It shows '1' and has one adjacent flag at (3,2). Again, no other bombs should be adjacent to (4,2).\n\nSo far, the flag at (3,2) seems consistent with the adjacent numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Look for obvious conflicts\n\nNext, I'll scan the board for any numbers that might have conflicting flags. Since there's only one flag, and it's consistent with the adjacent numbers, there are no obvious conflicts.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\n\nThe game info states there are 10 bombs and 9 flags remaining. This means one bomb is already flagged at (3,2), and there are 9 more bombs to be flagged.\n\n### Step 4: Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile\n\nNow, I'll look for opportunities to place new flags or reveal safe tiles.\n\n**Examining (3,3):** It's an empty revealed space adjacent to the flag at (3,2). Since (3,2) is already flagged, and the adjacent numbers are satisfied, (3,3) is safe to reveal.\n\n**Examining (4,3):** It's an unexplored space adjacent to (4,2) which shows '1'. Since (3,2) is flagged and accounts for the bomb adjacent to (4,2), (4,3) should be safe to reveal.\n\n**Examining (5,3):** It's an unexplored space adjacent to (5,2) which shows '1'. (5,2) has no adjacent flags, so there must be one bomb adjacent to it. The possible adjacent unexplored spaces are (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,2), and (6,3). Since (4,2) is already revealed as '1' and has a flag at (3,2), the bomb must be among (4,3), (5,3), (6,2), or (6,3). Without more information, it's risky to reveal (5,3) at this stage.\n\n**Examining (6,3):** Similar to (5,3), it's adjacent to (5,2) and (6,2). Since (5,2) needs one bomb adjacent, and (6,2) is unexplored, (6,3) could potentially be a bomb. It's safer to avoid revealing it for now.\n\n**Examining (7,4):** It's an unexplored space adjacent to (7,3) which shows '2'. (7,3) has no adjacent flags, so there must be two bombs adjacent to it.

(8,3) has no adjacent flags, so there must be one bomb adjacent to it. The possible adjacent unexplored spaces are (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (9,3), and (9,4). Since (7,3) is revealed as '2' and needs two bombs, and (8,3) needs one bomb, it's possible that (8,4) is a bomb. However, without more information, it's safer to avoid revealing it.\n\n**Examining (9,4):** It's an unexplored space adjacent to (9,3) which shows '1'. (9,3) has no adjacent flags, so there must be one bomb adjacent to it. The possible adjacent unexplored spaces are (8,3), (8,4), (9,4).

Again, without more information, it's safer to avoid revealing it.\n\n**Examining (5,5):** It's an unexplored space adjacent to (5,4) which shows '1'. (5,4) has no adjacent flags, so there must be one bomb adjacent to it. The possible adjacent unexplored spaces are (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,4), and (6,5). Since (4,4) is unexplored, and (5,4) needs one bomb, (5,5) could be a bomb. It's safer to avoid revealing it.\n\n**Examining (6,5):** It's an unexplored space adjacent to (6,4) which shows '1'. (6,4) has no adjacent flags, so there must be one bomb adjacent to it. The possible adjacent unexplored spaces are (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), and (7,5). Since (5,4) is unexplored, and (6,4) needs one bomb, (6,5) could be a bomb. It's safer to avoid revealing it.\n\n**Examining (7,5):** It's an unexplored space adjacent to (7,4) which shows '2'. (7,4) has no adjacent flags, so there must be two bombs adjacent to it. The possible adjacent unexplored spaces are (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,4), and (8,5). Without more information, it's unclear where the bombs are, so revealing (7,5) is risky.\n\n**Examining (8,5):** It's an unexplored space adjacent to (8,4) which shows '1'. (8,4) has no adjacent flags, so there must be one bomb adjacent to it. The possible adjacent unexplored spaces are (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (9,4), and (9,5).

Since (3,2) is already flagged, and the adjacent numbers are satisfied, (3,3) is safe to reveal.\n\n### Decision\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the safest move is to reveal (4,3) because it's adjacent to (4,2) which has a flag that accounts for its bomb, making (4,3) a safe tile to reveal.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** (4,3) is adjacent to (4,2) which shows '1' and has a flag at (3,2).

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 8, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "### Introduction\n\nMinesweeper is a single-player puzzle game where the objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden \"mines\" or bombs without detonating any of them. The game provides numbers in revealed cells that indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that cell. Using logic and deduction, players can determine the locations of the mines and mark them with flags.\n\n### Understanding the Current Board State\n\nLet's analyze the given Minesweeper board to identify potential moves. Here's the current state of the board:\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n1 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n2 . . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ _\n3 . . 1 F _ _ _ 1 1 1\n4 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n5 . . 1 1 1 _ 1 2 . .\n6 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n7 . . . . 2 _ 1 1 . .\n8 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .\n```\n\n**Legend:**\n- `.`: Unexplored space\n- `_`: Empty revealed space\n- `F`: Flagged space\n- `1-8`: Number indicating adjacent bombs\n\n**Game Info:**\n- Board size: 10x10\n- Flags remaining: 9\n- Bombs: 10\n\n### Step 1: Checking Revealed Numbers Against Existing Flags\n\nFirst, we'll examine each revealed number to ensure that the number of adjacent flags matches the number indicated by the cell.\n\n**Example:**\n- **Cell (3,3):** It has a flag (`F`). Let's see what numbers are adjacent to it.\n  \n  Adjacent cells to (3,3):\n  - (2,2): `1`\n  - (2,3): `1`\n  - (2,4): `1`\n  - (3,2): `1`\n  - (3,4): `_`\n  - (4,2): `1`\n  - (4,3): `_`\n  - (4,4): `_`\n  \n  The adjacent numbers are all `1`s. Since there's only one flag at (3,3), these `1`s should have exactly one bomb adjacent to them. This seems consistent.\n\n### Step 2: Looking for Obvious Conflicts\n\nWe need to ensure that no numbered cell has more adjacent flags than its number indicates.\n\n**Example:**\n- **Cell (5,7):** It shows a `2`. Let's check its adjacent cells.\n  \n  Adjacent cells to (5,7):\n  - (4,6): `_`\n  - (4,7): `1`\n  - (4,8): `_`\n  - (5,6): `1`\n  - (5,8): `.`\n  - (6,6): `1`\n  - (6,7): `1`\n  - (6,8): `.`\n  \n  There are no flags adjacent to (5,7), which is consistent since the cell shows `2`. We need to determine where the two bombs are located.\n\n### Step 3: Considering Remaining Flags vs. Bombs\n\nWe have 9 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total. One bomb has already been flagged at (3,3), so there are 9 bombs left to flag.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying Safe Moves and Flag Placements\n\n**Analyzing Cell (5,7):**\n- It shows a `2`, and there are two unexplored adjacent cells: (5,8) and (6,8).\n  \n  Since we need exactly two bombs adjacent to (5,7), and there are two unexplored cells, both (5,8) and (6,8) must be bombs. Therefore, we can place flags there.\n\n**Analyzing Cell (7,5):**\n- It shows a `2`. Let's check its adjacent cells.\n  \n  Adjacent cells to (7,5):\n  - (6,4): `1`\n  - (6,5): `_`\n  - (6,6): `1`\n  - (7,4): `2`\n  - (7,6): `1`\n  - (8,4): `1`\n  - (8,5): `_`\n  - (8,6): `_`\n  \n  The unexplored cells are (6,5), (8,5), and (8,6). Since (7,5) shows a `2`, and there are three unexplored cells, we need to determine which two of these three are bombs. This requires further analysis.\n\n### Step 5: Making a Decisive Move\n\nBased on the analysis of cell (5,7), we can confidently place flags on cells (5,8) and (6,8) since both must be bombs to satisfy the `2` in (5,7).\n\n### Conclusion and Next Move\n\nAfter carefully examining the board, the most logical next move is to place flags on cells (5,8) and (6,8) to mark them as bombs. This move is safe and aligns with the rules of Minesweeper.\n\n**EXPLANATION:**  \nCell (5,7) shows a `2`, and the adjacent unexplored cells are (5,8) and (6,8). Since both must be bombs to satisfy the `2`, we can safely place flags on these cells.\n\n**MOVE:**  \n- **First Flag:** 5,8,true  \n- **Second Flag:** 6,8,true\n\n*Note: Since the current implementation expects a single move, we'll proceed with the first flag placement.*\n\n**Final Move:**  \n**MOVE:** 5,8,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n1 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n2 . . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ _\n3 . . 1 F _ _ _ 1 1 1\n4 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n5 . . 1 1 1 _ 1 2 . .\n6 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n7 . . . . 2 _ 1 1 . .\n8 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}

All flags placed so far are consistent with the numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Consider remaining flags vs bombs**\nThere are 10 bombs on the board, and 5 flags have already been placed. So, 5 bombs remain to be flagged.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Decide on the next move**\n- **Tile (5, 2):** It shows a '1' and has three adjacent unexplored tiles: (4, 1), (4, 3), and (5, 3).

Therefore, the bomb must be either (4, 3) or (5, 3).\n  - Since we cannot determine which one is the bomb yet, we cannot safely place a flag here.\n- **Tile (3, 2):** It shows a '1' and has one adjacent flag at (3, 3).

This means there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (3,3).\n   - At (5,7), there is a '1' and it has a flag at (5,8). This means there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (5,7).\n\n2. **Looking for Obvious Conflicts:**\n   - No obvious conflicts are present.\n\n3. **Remaining Flags vs Bombs:**\n   - There are 4 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total. You've already flagged 4 bombs, so 6 bombs are still unflagged.\n\n4. **Identifying Safe Moves:**\n   - At (6,6), there is a '1' and it has no adjacent flags. This means it must have one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent unexplored squares are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (7,5), (7,6), and (7,7). Since (5,7) has a flag, the bomb must be in one of the other squares.\n   - At (7,6), there is a '1' and it has no adjacent flags. This means it must have one bomb in its adjacent squares.
