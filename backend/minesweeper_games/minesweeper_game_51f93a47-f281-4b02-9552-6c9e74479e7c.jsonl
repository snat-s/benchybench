make safe moves or identify potential bomb locations.\n\n#### **Tile (7,8): Adjacent to (6,7) and (7,7) which both show '1'**\n\n- **Tile (6,7):** Needs one bomb adjacent, which must be at (7,8).\n  \n  Therefore, (7,8) must be a bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:** We can safely place a flag at (7,8).\n\n#### **Tile (7,3): Adjacent to (8,3) and (8,4) which both show '1'**\n\n- **Tile (8,3):** Needs one bomb adjacent, which could be at (7,2), (7,3), or (9,2).\n  \n- **Tile (8,4):** Needs one bomb adjacent, which must be at (7,3).\n\n**Conclusion:** (7,3) must be a bomb.\n\n**Action:** Place a flag at (7,3).\n\n#### **Tile (5,3): Adjacent to (5,4) which shows '1'**\n\n- **Tile (5,4):** Needs one bomb adjacent, which could be at (4,3), (4,4), (5,3), or (6,3).\n\nWithout additional information, we cannot determine if (5,3) is a bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot place a flag here yet.\n\n#### **Tile (6,3): Adjacent to (6,4) which shows '1'**\n\n- **Tile (6,4):** Needs one bomb adjacent, which could be at (5,3), (6,3), or (7,3).\n\nWe already flagged (7,3) as a bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since (7,3) is already a bomb, neither (5,3) nor (6,3) can be bombs because that would exceed the count for tile (6,4).\n\n**Action:** Reveal tile (6,3) as safe.\n\n#### **Tile (9,7): Adjacent to (8,7) which shows '1'**\n\n- **Tile (8,7):** Needs one bomb adjacent, which could be at (7,8) or (9,7).\n\nWe already flagged (7,8) as a bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since (7,8) is already a bomb, (9,7) cannot be a bomb.\n\n**Action:** Reveal tile (9,7) as safe.\n\n#### **Tile (7,2): Adjacent to (8,2) which shows '2'**\n\n- **Tile (8,2):** Needs two bombs adjacent, which could be at (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), or (9,1).\n\nWe already flagged (7,3) as a bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only one bomb has been identified so far adjacent to (8,2). Therefore, among (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), and (9,1), one more must be a bomb.\n\n**Action:** More information is needed to determine the exact location of the second bomb.\n\n#### **Tile (9,1): Adjacent to (9,2) which shows '1'**\n\n- **Tile (9,2):** Needs one bomb adjacent, which could be at (8,1), (8,2), or (9,1).\n\nWithout additional information, we cannot determine if (9,1) is a bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot place a flag here yet.\n\n#### **Tile (8,1): Adjacent to (8,2) which shows '2'**\n\n- **Tile (8,2):** Needs two bombs adjacent, which could be at (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), or (9,1).\n\nWe already flagged (7,3) as a bomb, which is not adjacent to (8,2).\n\n**Conclusion:** Two bombs are needed among (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), and (9,1).\n\n**Action:** More information is needed to determine the exact locations.\n\n#### **Tile (5,9): Adjacent to (6,8) which shows '2'**\n\n- **Tile (6,8):** Needs two bombs adjacent, which could be at (5,9), (6,9), (7,8), or (7,9).\n\nWe already flagged (7,8) as a bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:** One more bomb is needed among (5,9), (6,9), or (7,9).\n\n**Action:** More information is needed to determine the exact location.\n\n#### **Tile (6,9): Adjacent to (6,8) which shows '2'**\n\n- **Tile (6,8):** Needs two bombs adjacent, which could be at (5,9), (6,9), (7,8), or (7,9).\n\nWe already flagged (7,8) as a bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:** One more bomb is needed among (5,9), (6,9), or (7,9).\n\n**Action:** More information is needed to determine the exact location.\n\n#### **Tile (7,9): Adjacent to (6,8) which shows '2'**\n\n- **Tile (6,8):** Needs two bombs adjacent, which could be at (5,9), (6,9), (7,8), or (7,9).\n\nWe already flagged (7,8) as a bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:** One more bomb is needed among (5,9), (6,9), or (7,9).\n\n**Action:** More information is needed to determine the exact location.\n\n### **Summarizing Identified Bombs and Safe Tiles**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n\n- **Bombs:**\n  - (7,8)\n  - (7,3)\n\n- **Safe Tiles:**\n  - (6,3)\n  - (9,7)\n\n**Flags Remaining:** 10 - 2 = 8\n\n### **Determining the Next Move**\n\nGiven the information, the most certain moves are:\n\n1. **Place a flag at (7,8):** Confirmed as a bomb based on tile (6,7).\n\n2. **Place a flag at (7,3):** Confirmed as a bomb based on tile (8,4).\n\n3. **Reveal tile (6,3):** Confirmed safe based on tile (6,4) and the bomb at (7,3).\n\n4. **Reveal tile (9,7):** Confirmed safe based on tile (8,7) and the bomb at (7,8).\n\nSince placing flags is more critical to avoid accidentally revealing bombs, we'll prioritize placing flags first.\n\n**Next Move: Place a flag at (7,8).**\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (6,7) shows '1', and it's only adjacent unexplored tile is (7,8).

This means there's one bomb left to flag.\n\n**Step 4: Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile.**\n\nLet's identify safe moves and potential flag placements.\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves\n\n**Tile (6,6):**\n- It's unexplored (`.`).\n- Adjacent to tile (6,5) with value '1', which has one bomb adjacent.\n- Tile (6,7) is already a flag (`F`), so tile (6,6) cannot be a bomb.\n- Therefore, it's safe to reveal.\n\n**Tile (5,6):**\n- It's unexplored (`.`).\n- Adjacent to tile (5,5) with value '1', which has one bomb adjacent.\n- Tile (5,7) is already a flag (`F`), so tile (5,6) cannot be a bomb.\n- Therefore, it's safe to reveal.\n\n### Potential Flag Placements\n\n**Tile (6,7):**\n- Already flagged (`F`).\n- Adjacent to tile (6,6) which we just determined is safe.\n- No conflict here.\n\n**Tile (7,7):**\n- It's unexplored (`.`).\n- Adjacent to tile (7,8) with value '2', which needs one more bomb.\n- Tile (7,9) is unexplored (`.`).\n- Since tile (7,8) requires one more bomb, and tile (7,7) is adjacent, it's a potential bomb.\n\nHowever, before placing a flag, I need to ensure it doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\n**Checking Tile (7,7):**\n- Adjacent to tile (7,8) which needs one more bomb.\n- Adjacent to tile (6,7) which is already flagged.\n- Placing a flag here would satisfy tile (7,8)'s requirement.\n  \nBut let's verify further.\n\n**Tile (6,7) is already flagged, and it's adjacent to tile (6,6) which is safe.**\n\nThis means tile (6,7) is a bomb, and it's correctly flagged.\n\n**Tile (7,7):**\n- Adjacent to tile (7,8) which needs one more bomb.\n- Tile (6,7) is already flagged, so tile (7,7) is the only other adjacent unexplored tile.\n- Therefore, it must be a bomb.\n\n**Conclusion:** Tile (7,7) is a bomb.\n\n### Making the Move\n\nBased on the analysis, the next logical move is to place a flag on tile (7,7) since it's confirmed to be a bomb.\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\nAfter analyzing the revealed numbers and existing flags, tile (7,7) is determined to be a bomb because tile (7,8) with value '2' requires one more adjacent bomb, and the only unexplored adjacent tile is (7,7).

The adjacent unexplored tiles are (8, 1), (9, 1), and (9, 3). However, since the number is 1 and there are no adjacent flags, we need to consider the surrounding tiles to determine where the bomb might be. For now, we'll focus on the previous analysis.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the most confident move is to place a flag at (6, 7).\n\nMOVE: 6,7,true", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . 1 _ _\n1 . . . . . . . 1 _ _\n2 . . . . . 2 1 1 _ _\n3 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n4 . . . . . 1 _ _ 1 1\n5 . . . . 1 1 _ _ 1 .\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 .\n7 . . . . 1 _ _ F F .\n8 . . 2 1 1 _ _ 1 2 .\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 .", "sucess": true}

Understanding the Current Board State**\n\nFirst, I need to familiarize myself with the current state of the Minesweeper board. Here's how I interpret it:\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . 1 _ _\n1 . . . . . . . 1 _ _\n2 . . . . . 2 1 1 _ _\n3 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n4 . . . . . 1 _ _ 1 1\n5 . . . . 1 1 _ _ 1 .\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ F 2 .\n7 . . . . 1 _ _ F F .\n8 . . 2 1 1 _ _ 1 2 .\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n```\n\n- **`.` (Unexplored):** These are tiles that haven't been revealed yet. They could either be safe or contain a bomb.\n  \n- **`_` (Empty revealed space):** These tiles have been revealed and do not contain bombs. They are safe.\n  \n- **`F` (Flagged):** These tiles are marked as potential bombs. Based on the rules, each flagged tile is assumed to be a bomb.\n  \n- **Numbers (1-8):** These indicate how many bombs are adjacent to the tile in the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Numbers and Flags**\n\nTo make an informed move, I need to analyze the numbers on the board and see how they relate to the flagged tiles.\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number `1` at (0,7):**\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (0,6): `.`\n  - (1,6): `.`\n  - (1,7): `1`\n  - (1,8): `_`\n  \n- **Flagged Tiles Adjacent:**\n  - None\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  Since the number is `1`, there should be exactly one bomb in the adjacent tiles. Currently, there are no flags adjacent to it, so either (0,6), (1,6), or (1,7) could contain a bomb. However, (1,7) is already showing a `1`, which might influence our decision.\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number `1` at (1,7):**\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (0,7): `1`\n  - (0,8): `_`\n  - (1,6): `.`\n  - (2,6): `1`\n  - (2,7): `1`\n  - (2,8): `_`\n  \n- **Flagged Tiles Adjacent:**\n  - None\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  Similar to (0,7), there should be exactly one bomb in the adjacent tiles. Possible bomb locations are (1,6), (2,6), or (2,7).\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number `2` at (2,5):**\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (1,4): `.`\n  - (1,5): `.`\n  - (1,6): `.`\n  - (2,4): `.`\n  - (2,6): `1`\n  - (3,4): `.`\n  - (3,5): `1`\n  - (3,6): `_`\n  \n- **Flagged Tiles Adjacent:**\n  - None\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  The number `2` indicates two bombs in the adjacent tiles. Since there are no flags adjacent to it, we need to consider which of these `.` tiles might contain bombs. However, without more information, it's challenging to determine exact bomb locations here.\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number `1` at (3,5):**\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (2,4): `.`\n  - (2,5): `2`\n  - (2,6): `1`\n  - (3,4): `.`\n  - (3,6): `_`\n  - (4,4): `.`\n  - (4,5): `1`\n  - (4,6): `_`\n  \n- **Flagged Tiles Adjacent:**\n  - None\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  There should be exactly one bomb in the adjacent tiles. Possible bomb locations include (2,4), (3,4), or (4,4).\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number `1` at (4,5):**\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (3,4): `.`\n  - (3,5): `1`\n  - (3,6): `_`\n  - (4,4): `.`\n  - (4,6): `_`\n  - (5,4): `1`\n  - (5,5): `1`\n  - (5,6): `_`\n  \n- **Flagged Tiles Adjacent:**\n  - None\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  Exactly one bomb should be adjacent. Possible bomb locations include (3,4), (4,4), or (5,4).\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number `1` at (5,4):**\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (4,3): `.`\n  - (4,4): `.`\n  - (4,5): `1`\n  - (5,3): `.`\n  - (5,5): `1`\n  - (6,3): `.`\n  - (6,4): `1`\n  - (6,5): `_`\n  \n- **Flagged Tiles Adjacent:**\n  - None\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  Exactly one bomb should be adjacent. Possible bomb locations include (4,3), (4,4), (5,3), or (6,3).\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number `1` at (6,4):**\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (5,3): `.`\n  - (5,4): `1`\n  - (5,5): `1`\n  - (6,3): `.`\n  - (6,5): `_`\n  - (7,3): `.`\n  - (7,4): `1`\n  - (7,5): `_`\n  \n- **Flagged Tiles Adjacent:**\n  - None\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  Exactly one bomb should be adjacent. Possible bomb locations include (5,3), (6,3), or (7,3).\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number `1` at (7,4):**\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (6,3): `.`\n  - (6,4): `1`\n  - (6,5): `_`\n  - (7,3): `.`\n  - (7,5): `_`\n  - (8,3): `1`\n  - (8,4): `1`\n  - (8,5): `_`\n  \n- **Flagged Tiles Adjacent:**\n  - None\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  Exactly one bomb should be adjacent. Possible bomb locations include (6,3), (7,3), or (8,3).\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number `1` at (8,3):**\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (7,2): `.`\n  - (7,3): `.`\n  - (7,4): `1`\n  - (8,2): `.`\n  - (8,4): `1`\n  - (9,2): `1`\n  - (9,3): `_`\n  - (9,4): `_`\n  \n- **Flagged Tiles Adjacent:**\n  - None\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  Exactly one bomb should be adjacent. Possible bomb locations include (7,2), (7,3), (8,2), or (9,2).\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number `1` at (9,2):**\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (8,1): `.`\n  - (8,2): `.`\n  - (8,3): `1`\n  - (9,1): `.`\n  - (9,3): `_`\n  \n- **Flagged Tiles Adjacent:**\n  - None\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  Exactly one bomb should be adjacent. Possible bomb locations include (8,1), (8,2), (9,1), or (9,3). However, (9,3) is already revealed as `_`, so it's safe. Thus, the bomb must be among (8,1), (8,2), or (9,1).\n\n### **3. Identifying Safe Moves and Potential Bombs**\n\nNow, let's look for tiles that can be safely revealed or tiles that must contain bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\n#### **Looking at (6,7):**\n\n```\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ F 2 .\n```\n\n- **Tile (6,7):** `F` (Flagged)\n  \nGiven that it's flagged, we assume it's a bomb. Let's verify if this flag is correctly placed by checking adjacent numbers.\n\n- **Adjacent Numbers:**\n  - (5,6): `_`\n  - (5,7): `_`\n  - (5,8): `1`\n  - (6,6): `_`\n  - (6,8): `2`\n  - (7,6): `_`\n  - (7,7): `F`\n  - (7,8): `F`\n  \n- **Analyzing (6,8):** Number `2` with adjacent flags:\n  - Flagged tiles: (6,7), (7,7), (7,8)\n  \nHowever, (6,8) is `2`, which means there should be exactly two bombs adjacent to it. It has three flagged tiles adjacent, which is a conflict.\n\n**Conclusion:** The flag at (6,7) might be incorrectly placed since (6,8) only requires two bombs, but it has three adjacent flags. This suggests that one of the flags is misplaced.\n\n#### **Looking at (6,8):** Number `2`\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (5,7): `_`\n  - (5,8): `1`\n  - (6,7): `F`\n  - (6,9): `.`\n  - (7,7): `F`\n  - (7,8): `F`\n  \n- **Flagged Tiles Adjacent:**\n  - (6,7), (7,7), (7,8)\n  \nGiven that (6,8) shows `2`, but there are three adjacent flags, this indicates that at least one of these flags is incorrect.\n\n#### **Looking at (7,7):** `F` (Flagged)\n\n- **Adjacent Numbers:**\n  - (6,6): `_`\n  - (6,7): `F`\n  - (6,8): `2`\n  - (7,6): `_`\n  - (7,8): `F`\n  - (8,6): `_`\n  - (8,7): `1`\n  - (8,8): `2`\n  \nLet's analyze (8,7): Number `1`\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (7,6): `_`\n  - (7,7): `F`\n  - (7,8): `F`\n  - (8,6): `_`\n  - (8,8): `2`\n  - (9,6): `.`\n  - (9,7): `_`\n  - (9,8): `1`\n  \nGiven that (8,7) is `1` and has two adjacent flags ((7,7) and (7,8)), this is a conflict because a `1` should have exactly one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The flags at (7,7) and (7,8) cannot both be bombs because that would exceed the number `1` at (8,7). Therefore, at least one of these flags is incorrect.\n\n#### **Looking at (8,8):** Number `2`\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (7,7): `F`\n  - (7,8): `F`\n  - (8,7): `1`\n  - (8,9): `.`\n  - (9,7): `_`\n  - (9,8): `1`\n  \nGiven that (8,8) is `2` and has two adjacent flags ((7,7) and (7,8)), this aligns with the number `2`. However, considering the conflict at (8,7), it's likely that one of these flags is incorrect.\n\n#### **Looking at (9,8):** Number `1`\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (8,7): `1`\n  - (8,8): `2`\n  - (8,9): `.`\n  - (9,7): `_`\n  - (9,9): `.`\n  \nGiven that (9,8) is `1`, and there are no adjacent flags, one of the adjacent `.` tiles must contain a bomb.\n\n### **4. Deciding on the Next Move**\n\nGiven the conflicts identified around the flags at (6,7), (7,7), and (7,8), it seems that at least one of these flags is incorrectly placed. To resolve this, I need to remove one of these flags to align the numbers correctly.\n\nHowever, before removing any flags, I should check if there's a tile that can be safely revealed to gather more information.\n\n#### **Potential Safe Move: (5,6):**\n\n```\n5 . . . . 1 1 _ _ 1 .\n```\n\n- **Tile (5,6):** `_`\n  \nLooking at the numbers around it:\n\n- **Adjacent Numbers:**\n  - (4,5): `1`\n  - (4,6): `_`\n  - (5,5): `1`\n  - (5,7): `_`\n  - (6,5): `_`\n  - (6,6): `_`\n  \nGiven that (5,5) is `1` and (5,6) is `_`, and considering that (5,5) already has an adjacent tile at (5,6) which is `_`, but since (5,6) is revealed as `_`, it's safe.\n\nHowever, (5,6) is already revealed as `_`, so it's already safe. Therefore, I need to look for another tile.\n\n#### **Potential Safe Move: (3,6):**\n\n```\n3 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n```\n\n- **Tile (3,6):** `_`\n  \nLooking at the numbers around it:\n\n- **Adjacent Numbers:**\n  - (2,5): `2`\n  - (2,6): `1`\n  - (2,7): `1`\n  - (3,5): `1`\n  - (3,7): `_`\n  - (4,5): `1`\n  - (4,6): `_`\n  - (4,7): `_`\n  \nGiven that (3,6) is `_` and (3,5) is `1`, and considering that (3,5) already has an adjacent tile at (3,6) which is `_`, but since (3,6) is revealed as `_`, it's safe.\n\nAgain, (3,6) is already revealed as `_`, so it's safe. I need to find another tile.\n\n#### **Potential Safe Move: (6,6):**\n\n```\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ F 2 .\n```\n\n- **Tile (6,6):** `_`\n  \nLooking at the numbers around it:\n\n- **Adjacent Numbers:**\n  - (5,5): `1`\n  - (5,6): `_`\n  - (5,7): `_`\n  - (6,5): `1`\n  - (6,7): `F`\n  - (7,5): `_`\n  - (7,6): `_`\n  - (7,7): `F`\n  \nGiven that (6,5) is `1` and (6,6) is `_`, and considering that (6,5) already has an adjacent tile at (6,6) which is `_`, but since (6,6) is revealed as `_`, it's safe.\n\nHowever, (6,6) is already revealed as `_`, so it's safe. I need to look for another tile.\n\n#### **Potential Safe Move: (6,9):**\n\n```\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ F 2 .\n```\n\n- **Tile (6,9):** `.`\n  \nLooking at the numbers around it:\n\n- **Adjacent Numbers:**\n  - (5,8): `1`\n  - (5,9): `.`\n  - (6,8): `2`\n  - (7,8): `F`\n  - (7,9): `.`\n  \nGiven that (6,8) is `2` and has two adjacent tiles at (6,7) and (6,9). Since (6,7) is flagged as `F`, and (6,9) is `.`, it's possible that (6,9) contains the second bomb.\n\nHowever, before flagging (6,9), I should verify if it's necessary.\n\n#### **Analyzing (5,8):** Number `1`\n\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - (4,7): `_`\n  - (4,8): `1`\n  - (4,9): `1`\n  - (5,7): `_`\n  - (5,9): `.`\n  - (6,7): `F`\n  - (6,8): `2`\n  - (6,9): `.`\n  \nGiven that (5,8) is `1` and has one adjacent flagged tile at (6,7), which is `F`. This satisfies the `1` at (5,8), meaning that no other adjacent tiles should contain bombs.\n\nTherefore, (5,9) and (6,9) cannot contain bombs because that would exceed the `1` at (5,8).\n\n**Conclusion:** Tile (6,9) is safe to reveal.\n\n#### **Final Decision: Reveal Tile (6,9)**\n\nSince (6,9) cannot contain a bomb based on the analysis of (5,8), it's safe to reveal this tile.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The number `1` at (5,8) is already satisfied by the flag at (6,7), so (6,9) cannot be a bomb. Therefore, it's safe to reveal (6,9) to gather more information.\n\n**MOVE:** 6,9,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . 1 _ _\n1 . . . . . . . 1 _ _\n2 . . . . . 2 1 1 _ _\n3 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n4 . . . . . 1 _ _ 1 1\n5 . . . . 1 1 _ _ 1 .\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ F 2 .\n7 . . . . 1 _ _ F F .\n8 . . 2 1 1 _ _ 1 2 .\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 .", "sucess": true}

This helps ensure that all flag placements are correct and to identify any potential conflicts.\n\n1. **Cell (0,7) = 1:**\n   - Adjacent cells: (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)\n   - Flagged cells: None adjacent.\n   - Since it's a '1', there should be exactly one bomb in these adjacent cells.\n\n2. **Cell (1,7) = 1:**\n   - Adjacent cells: (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n   - Flagged cells: None adjacent.\n   - Similar to (0,7), there should be exactly one bomb in these adjacent cells.\n\n3. **Cell (2,5) = 2:**\n   - Adjacent cells: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n   - Flagged cells: None adjacent.\n   - Two bombs are expected in these adjacent cells.\n\n4. **Cell (2,6) = 1:**\n   - Adjacent cells: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n   - Flagged cells: None adjacent.\n   - One bomb is expected in these adjacent cells.\n\n5. **Cell (2,7) = 1:**\n   - Adjacent cells: (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8)\n   - Flagged cells: None adjacent.\n   - One bomb is expected in these adjacent cells.\n\n6. **Cell (3,5) = 1:**\n   - Adjacent cells: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n   - Flagged cells: None adjacent.\n   - One bomb is expected in these adjacent cells.\n\n7. **Cell (4,5) = 1:**\n   - Adjacent cells: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n   - Flagged cells: None adjacent.\n   - One bomb is expected in these adjacent cells.\n\n8. **Cell (4,8) = 1:**\n   - Adjacent cells: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)\n   - Flagged cells: None adjacent.\n   - One bomb is expected in these adjacent cells.\n\n9. **Cell (5,8) = F:**\n   - Flagged cell. Let's verify if this flag is correctly placed.\n   - Adjacent cells: (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)\n   - Numbered cells adjacent: (4,8) = 1\n   - If (5,8) is a bomb, then (4,8)'s count is satisfied.\n\n10. **Cell (6,8) = 2:**\n    - Adjacent cells: (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n    - Flagged cells: (5,8) = F\n    - Since it's a '2' and one flag is already adjacent, there should be one more bomb in the remaining adjacent cells.\n\n11. **Cell (7,8) = F:**\n    - Flagged cell. Let's verify if this flag is correctly placed.\n    - Adjacent cells: (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,7), (7,9), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9)\n    - Numbered cells adjacent: (6,8) = 2, (7,9) = 2\n    - If (7,8) is a bomb, it contributes to both (6,8) and (7,9).\n\n12. **Cell (8,8) = F:**\n    - Flagged cell. Let's verify if this flag is correctly placed.\n    - Adjacent cells: (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n    - Numbered cells adjacent: (7,9) = 2, (9,8) = 1\n    - If (8,8) is a bomb, it contributes to both (7,9) and (9,8).\n\n13. **Cell (7,9) = 2:**\n    - Adjacent cells: (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8), (9,9)\n    - Flagged cells: (7,8) = F, (8,8) = F\n    - Since it's a '2' and two flags are already adjacent, there should be no more bombs in the remaining adjacent cells.\n\n14. **Cell (8,9) = F:**\n    - Flagged cell. Let's verify if this flag is correctly placed.\n    - Adjacent cells: (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8), (9,9)\n    - Numbered cells adjacent: (7,9) = 2, (8,8) = 1\n    - If (8,9) is a bomb, it contributes to both (7,9) and (8,8).\n\n15. **Cell (9,8) = 1:**\n    - Adjacent cells: (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9)\n    - Flagged cells: (8,8) = F, (8,9) = F\n    - Since it's a '1' and two flags are already adjacent, there's a conflict. However, since (8,8) and (8,9) are both flagged, and the number is '1', one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\n### Identifying Conflicts\n\nFrom the analysis above, there's a potential conflict at cell (9,8) = 1, which has two flagged adjacent cells: (8,8) and (8,9). Since the number indicates only one bomb, having two flags adjacent is impossible. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrectly placed.\n\n### Deciding Which Flag to Remove\n\nTo resolve this conflict, I need to determine which of the two flags, (8,8) or (8,9), is incorrectly placed.\n\n1. **Checking cell (8,8):**\n   - Adjacent cells: (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n   - Numbered cells adjacent: (7,9) = 2, (9,8) = 1\n   - If (8,8) is not a bomb, then (7,9) and (9,8) would need to have their bomb counts adjusted.\n\n2. **Checking cell (8,9):**\n   - Adjacent cells: (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8), (9,9)\n   - Numbered cells adjacent: (7,9) = 2, (8,8) = 1\n   - If (8,9) is not a bomb, then (7,9) and (8,8) would need to have their bomb counts adjusted.\n\nTo decide which flag to remove, I'll consider the implications of removing each one:\n\n- **Removing flag at (8,8):**\n  - (7,9) = 2: Currently has two flags adjacent, (7,8) and (8,8). If (8,8) is removed, (7,9) still has one flag, which satisfies its bomb count.\n  - (9,8) = 1: Currently has two flags adjacent, (8,8) and (8,9). If (8,8) is removed, (9,8) still has one flag, which satisfies its bomb count.\n  \n- **Removing flag at (8,9):**\n  - (7,9) = 2: Currently has two flags adjacent, (7,8) and (8,9). If (8,9) is removed, (7,9) still has one flag, which satisfies its bomb count.\n  - (9,8) = 1: Currently has two flags adjacent, (8,8) and (8,9). If (8,9) is removed, (9,8) still has one flag, which satisfies its bomb count.\n\nBoth removals seem viable, but I need to look for additional clues to decide which one to remove.\n\n### Looking for Additional Clues\n\nLet's examine other parts of the board to see if there's more information that can help us decide.\n\n1. **Cell (6,8) = 2:**\n   - Adjacent cells: (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n   - Flagged cells: (5,8) = F\n   - Since it's a '2' and one flag is already adjacent, there should be one more bomb in the remaining adjacent cells.\n\n2. **Cell (7,8) = F:**\n   - Adjacent to (6,8) and (7,9)\n   - If (7,8) is a bomb, it contributes to both (6,8) and (7,9).\n\n3. **Cell (7,9) = 2:**\n   - Adjacent cells: (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8), (9,9)\n   - Flagged cells: (7,8) = F, (8,8) = F, (8,9) = F\n   - Since it's a '2' and three flags are adjacent, there's a conflict. There should only be two bombs adjacent, but three flags are present.\n\nThis indicates another conflict at cell (7,9) = 2, which has three adjacent flags: (7,8), (8,8), and (8,9). Since the number is '2', having three flags is impossible. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrectly placed.\n\n### Resolving Multiple Conflicts\n\nNow, we have two conflicts:\n1. At cell (9,8) = 1, with two adjacent flags: (8,8) and (8,9).\n2. At cell (7,9) = 2, with three adjacent flags: (7,8), (8,8), and (8,9).\n\nTo resolve these conflicts, let's consider that among the three flags, only two can be correct. We need to determine which one is the extra flag.\n\nLooking at the flags:\n- (7,8): Adjacent to (6,8) and (7,9)\n- (8,8): Adjacent to (7,9) and (9,8)\n- (8,9): Adjacent to (7,9) and (9,8)\n\nIf we assume that (7,8) is correct (since it's adjacent to (6,8) = 2 and (7,9) = 2), then:\n- (7,9) = 2: Needs two bombs, one of which is (7,8). Therefore, another bomb must be among (8,8) or (8,9).\n- (9,8) = 1: Should have only one bomb adjacent, which can be either (8,8) or (8,9).\n\nIf we remove (8,9):\n- (7,9) = 2: Has (7,8) and (8,8) as adjacent bombs, which satisfies the count.\n- (9,8) = 1: Has (8,8) as the adjacent bomb, which satisfies the count.\n\nIf we remove (8,8):\n- (7,9) = 2: Has (7,8) and (8,9) as adjacent bombs, which satisfies the count.\n- (9,8) = 1: Has (8,9) as the adjacent bomb, which satisfies the count.\n\nBoth options seem to resolve the conflicts. However, removing (8,9) seems more consistent because:\n- (6,8) = 2: Has (5,8) = F and needs one more bomb adjacent, which can be (7,8).\n- (7,8) being a bomb satisfies (6,8) = 2 and (7,9) = 2.\n- (9,8) = 1: Only needs one bomb, which can be (8,8).\n\nTherefore, removing (8,9) resolves both conflicts without causing additional issues.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the above analysis, the flag at (8,9) is incorrectly placed and should be removed. This will resolve the conflicts at cells (9,8) and (7,9).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The flag at (8,9) causes conflicts with the numbers at (9,8) and (7,9). Removing it resolves these inconsistencies and aligns with the bomb counts indicated by the adjacent numbers.\n\n**MOVE:** 8,9,false (Remove the flag at (8,9))", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . 1 _ _\n1 . . . . . . . 1 _ _\n2 . . . . . 2 1 1 _ _\n3 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n4 . . . . . 1 _ _ 1 1\n5 . . . . 1 1 _ _ F .\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ F 2 2\n7 . . . . 1 _ _ F F 2\n8 . . 2 1 1 _ _ 1 2 F\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 .", "sucess": false}
