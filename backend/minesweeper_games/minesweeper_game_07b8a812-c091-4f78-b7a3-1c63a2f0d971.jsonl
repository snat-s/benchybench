{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board. The board is 10x10, and all the squares are currently unexplored, represented by dots. There are 10 flags remaining, and there are 10 bombs on the board. \n\nFirst, I remember that the goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. Since the board is completely unexplored, I have to start somewhere. Usually, the best strategy is to click on a corner because if it's a mine, you lose, but if it's not, it gives you information about adjacent squares. But since all squares are unexplored, maybe I should consider placing flags based on some initial reasoning.\n\nWait, but I have 10 flags and 10 bombs, so theoretically, if I can correctly flag all 10 bombs, I win. But without any revealed numbers, it's impossible to know where the bombs are. So maybe I should start by revealing a square to get some information.\n\nBut let's think about the critical flag placement rules. Rule 1 says that each number indicates exactly how many bombs are adjacent. But since no numbers are revealed yet, I can't apply that rule. So perhaps I should focus on revealing a square to get started.\n\nI'm a bit torn because if I reveal a square and it's a bomb, the game ends. But since all squares are unexplored, the probability of hitting a bomb is 10/100, which is 10%. That's a 10% chance of losing immediately, but without any information, I have to take that risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place a flag somewhere based on some pattern, but without any revealed numbers, it's hard to know where to place the flags. So perhaps the best move is to reveal a corner square, say (0,0). If it's a mine, I lose, but if it's not, it'll show me a number, which can help me deduce where the bombs are.\n\nLet me think about the coordinate system. The top-left corner is (0,0), and the bottom-right is (9,9). So, (0,0) is a good starting point because it's a corner, and if it's not a mine, it can give me some information about adjacent squares.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes, people start in the middle to maximize the information, but in a 10x10 board, the middle is (5,5), but I don't know if that's any safer. But without any information, any square is equally risky.\n\nWait, but if I place a flag on a square, I can mark it as a potential bomb without revealing it. But without any numbers, I can't be sure which squares are bombs. So maybe it's better to reveal a square to get started.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best move is to reveal the square at (0,0). If it's a bomb, I lose, but if it's not, I can proceed from there. Alternatively, maybe I should place a flag on a square that I think is likely to be a bomb, but without any information, that's a gamble.\n\nWait, another approach: since there are 10 bombs and 10 flags, perhaps I can place flags on squares that are in positions where bombs are likely. But without any revealed numbers, it's just a guess. So maybe it's better to reveal a square.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing (0,0). Let's see what happens. If it's a bomb, I lose, but if it's not, I can use the number to guide my next moves.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Since the board is completely unexplored, the best initial move is to reveal a corner square to gather information. Starting with (0,0) is a common strategy to begin the game.\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
