Given the rules and the state of the board, the best next step is to reveal a tile that could provide more information about the board's state without immediately risking revealing a bomb. Looking at the board, revealing a tile adjacent to a revealed number could provide useful insights, especially if it's near a tile with a low number, as this could help determine the location of bombs more accurately.\n\nConsidering the revealed numbers, especially the ones with lower values like '1', revealing a tile next to one of these could help in understanding the distribution of bombs. For instance, the tile at position (2,2) with a '1' has several unexplored adjacent tiles. Revealing one of these tiles could provide more information about the bombs' locations.\n\nMOVE: 2,0,false \n\nThis move chooses a relatively safe option by revealing an unexplored tile rather than placing a flag, which could potentially conflict with the rules about the exact number of adjacent bombs.
