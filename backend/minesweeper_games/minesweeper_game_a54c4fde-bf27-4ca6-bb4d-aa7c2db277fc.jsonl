{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs, and I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after making this move, the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '3'. That means there are 3 bombs adjacent to this cell. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nSince it's my first move and I have no other information, I should flag the cells that are likely to be bombs based on this number. But I need to be careful not to overflag or underflag.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total, I need to use them wisely. Each flag I place should be as accurate as possible.\n\nLet's say I decide to flag three cells adjacent to the '3'. But which three? I need to look at the board and see if any of these adjacent cells are already revealed or have numbers that can give me more information.\n\nAssuming that no other cells are revealed yet, I can choose to flag any three of the eight adjacent cells. For now, I'll choose to flag (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5).\n\nSo, my next moves would be:\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\n\nMOVE: 3,4,true\n\nMOVE: 4,3,true\n\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged three cells, and I have 7 flags left. Next, I should reveal another cell that is not adjacent to the initial reveal to try to expand the board further.\n\nLet's choose (6,6) as another safe starting point.\n\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\n\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\nSuppose this reveals a '1'. Now, there is only one bomb adjacent to (6,6). The adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nI need to see if any of these are already flagged or revealed. Assuming none are flagged yet, I'll flag one of them, say (6,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\n\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged four cells, and I have 6 flags left.\n\nContinuing this process, I need to look for more numbers and adjust my flags accordingly. If I reveal a cell and it shows a '0', that means there are no bombs adjacent to it, and the game should automatically reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nLet's say I reveal (5,4) and it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nI already have flags on (4,3), (4,5), and (6,5). So, out of the eight adjacent cells to (5,4), three are flagged. The number '2' means only two of them are bombs. This suggests that one of the flagged cells is not a bomb, which is a conflict.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If '2' means exactly two adjacent bombs, and I have three flags on adjacent cells, then one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. Therefore, I need to remove one flag from the adjacent cells of (5,4).\n\nSo, I need to unflag one of the cells: (4,3), (4,5), or (6,5). But I need to choose wisely.\n\nLooking at the board, if I unflag (6,5), and assuming that (6,5) is not a bomb, then the '1' at (6,6) would still need one flag, so maybe (6,7) should be flagged.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (3,3). Suppose it shows a '1'. Adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nI have a flag on (3,4) and (4,3). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (3,3). But the '1' indicates only one adjacent bomb. Therefore, one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. So, I need to unflag one of them.\n\nThis suggests that either (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb. But earlier, based on the '3' at (4,4), I flagged (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5). Now, if one of (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb, then perhaps (4,5) is the actual bomb.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (5,5). Suppose it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nI have flags on (4,5) and (6,5). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (5,5). The '2' means exactly two bombs adjacent, so the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (4,6), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,6) safely.\n\nLet's reveal (4,6). Suppose it shows a '0'. Then, the game should auto-reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nNow, the board has expanded in that area, giving me more information.\n\nContinuing this process, revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers, I can progress through the game.\n\nIt's important to keep track of the number of flags left and the number of potential bombs still to be flagged.\n\nAlso, sometimes, I might need to make educated guesses when there isn't enough information to be certain, but that can be risky.\n\nIn summary, my strategy is to:\n\n1. Make initial safe moves to start revealing the board.\n\n2. Flag cells based on the numbers revealed, ensuring that the number of flags matches the numbers.\n\n3. Reveal cells that are likely safe based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\n4. Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n5. Continue this process until all bombs are flagged or all safe cells are revealed.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this Minesweeper problem, we need to methodically reveal safe cells and flag bombs based on the numbers revealed, which indicate how many bombs are adjacent to each cell. Here is a step-by-step approach to playing the game:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - The first move is safe, so choose a central cell to maximize the area revealed.\n   - Based on the number revealed, flag the appropriate number of adjacent cells as bombs.\n\n2. **Expand the Board**:\n   - Choose another safe cell away from the initial move to further expand the revealed area.\n   - Continue flagging cells based on the numbers revealed.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If a number indicates fewer bombs than the flags placed, remove flags accordingly.\n   - Ensure that the number of flags around each numbered cell matches the number shown.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n6. **Completion**:\n   - The game is won by either revealing all safe cells or correctly flagging all bombs.\n\n### Solution Code Structure\n\nSince Minesweeper is an interactive problem, the solution involves a series of moves based on the board's state, which is updated after each move. Therefore, the solution is presented as a sequence of moves with explanations.\n\n### Example Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\n# Move 1: Initial safe move at center\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '3'\n# Flag three adjacent cells\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\nMOVE: 3,4,true\nMOVE: 4,3,true\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\n# Move 2: Another safe move away from initial reveal\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '1'\n# Flag one adjacent cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\n# Move 3: Reveal a new cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another cell to get more information.\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '2'\n# Adjust flags based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Adjust flags around '2' at (5,4).\n# If conflict, unflag one cell\nMOVE: 4,5,false  # Unflag if necessary\n\n# Move 4: Reveal a safe cell based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a safe cell adjacent to '2'.\nMOVE: 4,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '0'\n# Auto-reveal neighbors\nEXPLANATION: '0' at (4,6), auto-revealing neighbors.\n\n# Continue this process until the game is solved.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - Start with a safe move at the center to maximize reveal.\n   - Flag adjacent cells based on the number revealed.\n\n2. **Expanding the Board**:\n   - Make another safe move away from the initial reveal to get more information.\n   - Flag cells accordingly based on new revelations.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If flags exceed the number indicated, remove flags from likely safe cells.\n   - Ensure consistency between flags and numbers.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust strategy as new information is revealed to avoid conflicts and progress towards solving the board.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left, with 10 flags remaining. That means all the bombs are still unflagged.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the numbers and see what they're telling me about the surrounding squares. Let's check row 3 and row 4, where there are some numbers.\n\nIn row 3:\n\n- Position (3,6): 3\n\n- Position (3,7): 2\n\nIn row 4:\n\n- Position (4,5): 1\n\n- Position (4,6): 2\n\nIn row 5:\n\n- Position (5,5): 1\n\n- Position (5,6): 1\n\n- Position (5,7): 1\n\nSo, starting with position (3,6) which is a 3. That means there are 3 bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n\n- (3,5), (3,7)\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\nSimilarly, position (3,7) is a 2, so there are 2 bombs adjacent to it. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\n- (3,6), (3,8)\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\nPosition (4,5) is a 1, so one bomb adjacent. Adjacent squares:\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\n- (4,4), (4,6)\n\n- (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nPosition (4,6) is a 2, so two bombs adjacent. Adjacent squares:\n\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n\n- (4,5), (4,7)\n\n- (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n\nPosition (5,5) is a 1, one bomb adjacent. Adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\n- (5,4), (5,6)\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nPosition (5,6) is a 1, one bomb adjacent. Adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\n- (5,5), (5,7)\n\n- (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nPosition (5,7) is a 1, one bomb adjacent. Adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\n- (5,6), (5,8)\n\n- (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)\n\nNow, I need to see if there are any squares that are definitely safe or definitely bombs based on these numbers.\n\nLet's look at position (3,6) which is a 3. It has 8 adjacent squares, and 3 of them are bombs. Similarly, position (3,7) is a 2, so 2 bombs adjacent. Position (4,6) is a 2, so 2 bombs adjacent.\n\nLet's see if there's any overlap in their adjacent squares.\n\nSquares adjacent to both (3,6) and (3,7):\n\n- (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7)\n\nWait, actually, let's list the unique adjacent squares for both:\n\n- (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8)\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\nSo, there are some squares that are adjacent to both, like (2,6), (2,7), (3,6), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7).\n\nBut none of these squares are revealed yet, so I don't have any information about them yet.\n\nWait, actually, position (4,6) is a 2, which is adjacent to (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7).\n\nBut position (4,6) is already a number, so I shouldn't consider it as a bomb. So, the bombs must be in the adjacent unrevealed squares.\n\nWait, no, the numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent to them.\n\nSo, for position (3,6) which is a 3, there are 3 bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, position (3,7) is a 2, so 2 bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nPosition (4,6) is a 2, so 2 bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nI need to find a way to determine which of these adjacent squares are bombs.\n\nLet me try to find squares that are adjacent to multiple numbered tiles.\n\nFor example, square (3,6) is adjacent to (3,7), which is also adjacent to (4,6).\n\nWait, maybe I should try to look for squares that are only adjacent to one numbered tile, or find overlaps where the number of bombs required is already satisfied.\n\nBut in this case, most of the adjacent squares are still unrevealed.\n\nLet me see if there are any squares that are definitely safe.\n\nLooking at position (5,5), which is a 1, and its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\n- (5,4), (5,6)\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nNone of these are flagged yet, and none are revealed.\n\nSimilarly, position (5,6) is a 1, adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\n- (5,5), (5,7)\n\n- (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nAgain, nothing flagged or revealed.\n\nPosition (5,7) is a 1, adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\n- (5,6), (5,8)\n\n- (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)\n\nStill nothing flagged or revealed.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbered tiles and see if I can deduce something from that.\n\nLet's look at square (4,6), which is adjacent to:\n\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n\n- (4,5), (4,7)\n\n- (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n\nNone of these are flagged yet.\n\nWait, but position (3,6) is a 3, and position (3,7) is a 2, and position (4,6) is a 2.\n\nIf I can find a group of squares that must contain a certain number of bombs, I can try to see if I can flag some of them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a square that is safe to reveal because it's not adjacent to any bombs.\n\nBut given that I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs remaining, I need to be careful not to place flags incorrectly.\n\nWait, actually, I have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs remaining, so I need to place exactly 10 flags on bombs.\n\nI need to make sure that the flags I place correspond exactly to the remaining bombs.\n\nLet me see if there are any obvious places where I can place flags.\n\nLooking at row 3 and row 4, where there are some numbers, but mostly unrevealed squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to reveal a square that seems safe.\n\nLet's consider position (2,4). It's adjacent to position (3,4), which is unrevealed, and position (3,5), which is unrevealed, and position (4,4), which is unrevealed.\n\nNone of these are flagged, and there are no numbers adjacent to them that indicate bombs.\n\nSo, maybe position (2,4) is safe to reveal.\n\nBut before I do that, let me check if there's any other information I can use.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to place a flag on a square that is likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at position (3,5), which is adjacent to position (3,6) which is a 3, and position (4,6) which is a 2.\n\nIf I can determine that position (3,5) is a bomb, I can flag it.\n\nBut I don't have enough information yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that position (3,5) is a bomb, and see if that satisfies the numbers.\n\nBut with multiple possibilities, it's hard to be certain.\n\nMaybe I should just reveal a square that seems safe.\n\nLet's choose position (2,4).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Position (2,4) is surrounded by unrevealed squares with no adjacent numbers indicating bombs, suggesting it's safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . 3 2 . .\n4 . . . . . 1 2 . . .\n5 . . . . . 1 1 1 . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

'1'\n\n- (4,7) is a '2'\n\nSo, for position (3,6), which is a '3', it needs exactly three bombs around it.\n\nLooking at its adjacent positions:\n\n- (2,5): part of another '3', so likely has bombs around it as well\n\n- (2,6): unexplored\n\n- (2,7): unexplored\n\n- (3,5): unexplored\n\n- (3,7): '2'\n\n- (4,5): unexplored\n\n- (4,6): '1'\n\n- (4,7): '2'\n\nHmm, tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the combination of these numbers.\n\nLet's see, position (3,6) is '3', so three bombs around it.\n\nPosition (3,7) is '2', so two bombs around it.\n\nPosition (4,6) is '1', so one bomb around it.\n\nLooking at the overlapping areas:\n\nPositions (3,6) and (3,7) share adjacent positions (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7).\n\nWait, need to be careful.\n\nActually, position (3,6) is adjacent to:\n\n- (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) is adjacent to:\n\n- (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\nPosition (4,6) is adjacent to:\n\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n\nSo, the overlapping areas are positions like (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), etc.\n\nThis seems too vague to make a definite conclusion.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet's try to find a area where the number of unexplored tiles equals the number of remaining bombs needed.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has only one unexplored neighbor, then that must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, if a '2' has exactly two unexplored neighbors and no flags, then those must be bombs.\n\nLooking around, I don't see any such obvious scenarios.\n\nWait, let's check row 3, position (3,3), which is a '1'.\n\nIts adjacent positions are:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nAll of these are unexplored except for (2,3), which is a '1', and (3,4), which is a '2'.\n\nWait, (3,4) is a '2', which is already considered.\n\nSo, for position (3,3), which is a '1', and it has several unexplored neighbors, I can't pinpoint exactly where the bomb is.\n\nSimilarly, position (3,4), which is a '2', has several unexplored neighbors.\n\nThis isn't helping much.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total number of remaining bombs and flags.\n\nThere are 10 bombs left, and 10 flags remaining, so I need to place all 10 flags correctly.\n\nI need to be careful not to place any flags incorrectly, as that would mean I can't place a flag where there is actually a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to reveal safe tiles where I'm confident there are no bombs.\n\nLooking at row 6 and below, everything is unexplored.\n\nBut revealing random tiles there could be dangerous without more information.\n\nMaybe I should look for areas where the numbers indicate that certain tiles are safe.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has one unexplored neighbor, that neighbor must be a bomb, so the other neighbors are safe.\n\nBut in this board, I don't see any such clear scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, if a '3' has three unexplored neighbors and no flags, then all three must be bombs.\n\nBut again, in this board, the '3's have more than three unexplored neighbors, so it's not clear.\n\nWait, position (1,4) is a '3', and its adjacent positions are:\n\n- (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nPositions (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are '1', '3', '3', respectively.\n\nSo, some of these are numbers, some are unexplored.\n\nSimilarly complicated.\n\nThis is getting too confusing.\n\nMaybe I should try to look for a tile that is definitely safe to reveal.\n\nFor example, if I have a '1' with one unexplored neighbor, then that neighbor is a bomb, and the others are safe.\n\nBut again, I don't see that here.\n\nAlternatively, if I have a '2' with two unexplored neighbors and no flags, then both must be bombs.\n\nBut again, not seeing that.\n\nPerhaps I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLooking at row 5, positions (5,6), (5,7), (5,8) are all '1's.\n\nTheir adjacent positions are mostly unexplored.\n\nMaybe I can try to reveal a tile that is adjacent to multiple '1's, to see if it's safe.\n\nFor example, position (6,6), which is adjacent to (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7).\n\nIf I reveal (6,6), and if it's a bomb, I lose.\n\nBut if it's safe, it might give me more information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place a flag on a tile that seems likely to be a bomb.\n\nFor example, position (2,5) is adjacent to two '3's, which might suggest it's a bomb.\n\nBut I need to be careful.\n\nWait, position (2,5) is adjacent to:\n\n- (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nPositions (1,5) is unexplored, (2,4) is a '3', (2,6) is unexplored, (3,4) is a '2', (3,5) is unexplored, (4,4) is unexplored, (4,5) is unexplored.\n\nGiven that position (2,5) is adjacent to multiple '3's and '2's, it's likely to be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, position (2,6) is adjacent to '3's and '1's.\n\nThis is getting too speculative.\n\nMaybe I should just pick a tile that seems safe and reveal it.\n\nFor example, position (0,0). It's an unexplored tile in the corner.\n\nThe risk is that it might be a bomb, but given that there are 10 bombs on a 10x10 board, the probability is 10%.\n\nIt's a gamble, but maybe I have to take that chance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a tile that, if revealed, would give me the most information.\n\nFor example, revealing a tile adjacent to multiple numbers.\n\nLooking at position (3,5), which is adjacent to position (3,6), which is a '3', and position (4,5), which is unexplored.\n\nNot sure.\n\nThis is getting too vague.\n\nI think I need to make a move based on the least risk.\n\nGiven that, I'll choose to reveal position (0,0), assuming it's safe.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Choosing to reveal an unexplored tile in the corner, assuming it's safe.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . 3 . . . . .\n2 . . . 1 3 3 . . . .\n3 . . . 1 2 . 3 2 . .\n4 . . . . . 1 2 . . .\n5 . . . . . 1 1 1 . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 3, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. It's a 10x10 grid with 10 bombs left to find, and I have 10 flags remaining. Let's see what I can deduce from the current state.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that cell, and blank spaces ('_') are safe cells that have been revealed. Dots ('.') are unexplored cells, and presumably, if there were any flags, they would be marked as 'F', but I don't see any flags on the board right now.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: _ _ 1 . 3 . . . . .\n\nRow 2: _ _ 1 1 3 3 . . . .\n\nRow 3: _ _ 1 1 2 . 3 2 . .\n\nRow 4: _ _ 1 . . 1 2 . . .\n\nRow 5: _ _ 1 2 . 1 1 1 . .\n\nRow 6: _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: _ _ 1 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 9: _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n\nI need to find a safe move or place a flag where there's probably a bomb.\n\nLet's start by looking for areas where I can deduce the exact positions of bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 4, there's a '3'. This means there are 3 bombs adjacent to this cell. The adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)\n\n- (1,3), (1,5)\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nBut some of these are already revealed or have numbers. Let's see:\n\n- (0,3) is '.', unexplored\n\n- (0,4) is '.', unexplored\n\n- (0,5) is '.', unexplored\n\n- (1,3) is '1'\n\n- (1,5) is '.', unexplored\n\n- (2,3) is '1'\n\n- (2,4) is '1'\n\n- (2,5) is '3'\n\nWait, actually, the '3' is at (1,4). Let's list its adjacent cells correctly:\n\n- (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)\n\n- (1,3), (1,5)\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nNow, looking at these:\n\n- (0,3): '.'\n\n- (0,4): '.'\n\n- (0,5): '.'\n\n- (1,3): '1'\n\n- (1,5): '.'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '3'\n\nSo, the '3' at (1,4) needs 3 bombs in these adjacent cells.\n\nBut, (1,3) is '1', which means only one adjacent bomb, and (2,3) is '1', and (2,4) is '1', and (2,5) is '3'.\n\nThis seems a bit complex. Maybe I should look for a simpler scenario.\n\nLet's look at row 2, column 5, which is '3'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\n- (2,4), (2,6)\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\nBut looking at the board:\n\n- (1,4): '3'\n\n- (1,5): '.'\n\n- (1,6): '.'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (2,6): '.'\n\n- (3,4): '2'\n\n- (3,5): '.'\n\n- (3,6): '3'\n\nSo, the '3' at (2,5) needs 3 bombs in these adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at (2,4): '1', which is adjacent to (1,4): '3', (1,5): '.', (2,5): '3', (3,4): '2', (3,5): '.'.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's check row 3, column 5, which is '.', unexplored. Adjacent to it are:\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '3'\n\n- (2,6): '.'\n\n- (3,4): '2'\n\n- (3,6): '3'\n\n- (4,4): '.'\n\n- (4,5): '.'\n\n- (4,6): '.'\n\nHmm, not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 6, column 3, which is '1'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (5,2): '_'\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\n- (5,4): '2'\n\n- (6,2): '_'\n\n- (6,4): '.'\n\n- (7,2): '_'\n\n- (7,3): '_'\n\n- (7,4): '.'\n\nSo, (6,3): '1' needs exactly one bomb in these adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (5,2): safe\n\n- (5,3): '1' (safe)\n\n- (5,4): '2' (safe)\n\n- (6,2): safe\n\n- (6,4): unexplored\n\n- (7,2): safe\n\n- (7,3): safe\n\n- (7,4): unexplored\n\nSo, only (6,4) and (7,4) are unexplored. Since (6,3) '1' needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells, and only two are unexplored, one of them must be a bomb.\n\nBut I have to be careful. Let's see if I can find another clue to determine which one is the bomb.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4, which is '2'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\n- (4,4): '.'\n\n- (4,5): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\n- (5,5): '1'\n\n- (6,3): '1'\n\n- (6,4): '.'\n\n- (6,5): '.'\n\nSo, (5,4): '2' needs exactly two bombs in these adjacent cells.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (4,3): safe\n\n- (4,4): unexplored\n\n- (4,5): unexplored\n\n- (5,3): '1' (safe)\n\n- (5,5): '1' (safe)\n\n- (6,3): '1' (safe)\n\n- (6,4): unexplored\n\n- (6,5): unexplored\n\nSo, from (5,4): '2', the possible bomb locations are (4,4), (4,5), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nBut from (6,3): '1', we know that only one of (6,4) and (7,4) is a bomb.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet's try to find a cell that is definitely safe to reveal or definitely a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 2, which is '1'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,1): '_'\n\n- (0,3): '.'\n\n- (1,1): '_'\n\n- (1,2): '_'\n\n- (1,3): '1'\n\n- (2,1): '_'\n\n- (2,2): '_'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\nSo, (0,2): '1' has adjacent cells:\n\n- (0,1): safe\n\n- (0,3): unexplored\n\n- (1,1): safe\n\n- (1,2): safe\n\n- (1,3): '1' (safe)\n\n- (2,1): safe\n\n- (2,2): safe\n\n- (2,3): '1' (safe)\n\nWait, so all adjacent cells are safe except (0,3), which is unexplored. But (0,2): '1' needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. All others are safe, so (0,3) must be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, I should place a flag at (0,3).\n\nBut wait, let's confirm this.\n\nIf (0,3) is a bomb, then (1,3): '1' would have its bomb accounted for, since (0,3) is adjacent to it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3): '1' would also have its bomb accounted for by (0,3), but (2,3): '1' is adjacent to (1,3): '1', which is already accounted for.\n\nWait, this seems off. Let me double-check.\n\n(0,2): '1' has adjacent cells:\n\n- (0,1): safe\n\n- (0,3): unexplored\n\n- (1,1): safe\n\n- (1,2): safe\n\n- (1,3): '1' (safe)\n\n- (2,1): safe\n\n- (2,2): safe\n\n- (2,3): '1' (safe)\n\nSo, only (0,3) is unexplored. Since (0,2): '1' needs exactly one bomb in these adjacent cells, and all others are safe, (0,3) must be a bomb.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I should place a flag at (0,3).\n\nBut before I do that, let's see if there are any other obvious moves.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 4, which is '3'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)\n\n- (1,3), (1,5)\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nFrom earlier, if (0,3) is a bomb, then (1,3): '1' has its bomb accounted for.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3): '1' would also have its bomb accounted for.\n\nBut (2,4): '1' is adjacent to (1,4): '3', (2,3): '1' (bomb), (2,5): '3', (3,4): '2', (3,5): '.'.\n\nIf (2,3) is a bomb, then (2,4): '1' has its bomb accounted for.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4): '3' would have bombs at (0,3), possibly others.\n\nWait, maybe placing a flag at (0,3) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider row 6, column 4, which is '.', unexplored, adjacent to (5,3): '1', (5,4): '2', (5,5): '1', (6,3): '1', (6,5): '.', (7,3): '_', (7,4): '.', (7,5): '.'.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nGiven that, I think the safest move right now is to place a flag at (0,3), as it's logically deduced to be a bomb.\n\nSo, my move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the number '1' at (0,2), which requires exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells, and all adjacent cells are safe except (0,3), which must therefore be a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 0,3,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 . 3 . . . . .\n2 _ _ 1 1 3 3 . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 1 2 . 3 2 . .\n4 _ _ 1 . . 1 2 . . .\n5 _ _ 1 2 . 1 1 1 . .\n6 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n7 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n8 _ _ 1 1 . . . . . .\n9 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see some numbers and some flagged spaces. My goal is to either reveal a safe square or place a flag correctly without hitting a bomb.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. Let's look at the positions where there are numbers and see what they tell me about the surrounding squares.\n\nStarting from the top-left corner:\n\nRow 0:\n\n- Column 2: 1\n\n- Column 3: F (flagged)\n\n- Columns 4 to 9: all unexplored (.)\n\nRow 1:\n\n- Column 2: 1\n\n- Column 4: 3\n\n- Columns 5 to 9: unexplored\n\nRow 2:\n\n- Column 2: 1\n\n- Column 3: 1\n\n- Column 4: 3\n\n- Column 5: 3\n\n- Columns 6 to 9: unexplored\n\nRow 3:\n\n- Column 2: 1\n\n- Column 3: 1\n\n- Column 4: 2\n\n- Column 6: 3\n\n- Column 7: 2\n\n- Columns 8 and 9: unexplored\n\nRow 4:\n\n- Column 2: 1\n\n- Column 4: .\n\n- Column 6: 1\n\n- Column 7: 2\n\n- Columns 8 and 9: unexplored\n\nRow 5:\n\n- Column 2: 1\n\n- Column 3: 2\n\n- Column 5: 1\n\n- Column 6: 1\n\n- Column 7: 1\n\n- Columns 8 and 9: unexplored\n\nRow 6:\n\n- Columns 2 to 4: _, _, _\n\n- Column 5: .\n\n- Columns 6 to 9: unexplored\n\nRow 7:\n\n- Columns 2 to 4: _, _, _\n\n- Column 5: .\n\n- Columns 6 to 9: unexplored\n\nRow 8:\n\n- Column 2: 1\n\n- Column 3: 1\n\n- Column 5: .\n\n- Columns 6 to 9: unexplored\n\nRow 9:\n\n- Column 2: 1\n\n- Column 4: .\n\n- Columns 5 to 9: unexplored\n\nOkay, so there are several areas with numbers and some flags. Let's focus on the areas where I can deduce the positions of the bombs with certainty.\n\nFirst, look at row 1, column 4: it's a 3. This means there are 3 bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- Row 0, column 3: flagged (F)\n\n- Row 0, column 4: unexplored (.)\n\n- Row 0, column 5: unexplored (.)\n\n- Row 1, column 3: unexplored (.)\n\n- Row 1, column 5: unexplored (.)\n\n- Row 2, column 3: 1\n\n- Row 2, column 4: 1\n\n- Row 2, column 5: 3\n\nWait, actually, row 2, column 3 is a 1, which is already revealed.\n\nSo, for row 1, column 4 (3):\n\n- Adjacent squares:\n\n- (0,3): F\n\n- (0,4): .\n\n- (0,5): .\n\n- (1,3): .\n\n- (1,5): .\n\n- (2,3): 1\n\n- (2,4): 1\n\n- (2,5): 3\n\nNow, since (0,3) is flagged, that's one bomb. So, out of the 3 required for the 3, one is already accounted for. That means there are 2 more bombs in the remaining adjacent unexplored squares: (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, look at row 2, column 4: it's a 3.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,3): .\n\n- (1,4): 3\n\n- (1,5): .\n\n- (2,3): 1\n\n- (2,5): 3\n\n- (3,3): 1\n\n- (3,4): 1\n\n- (3,5): 2\n\nSo, for row 2, column 4 (3):\n\n- Adjacent squares:\n\n- (1,3): .\n\n- (1,5): .\n\n- (2,3): 1\n\n- (2,5): 3\n\n- (3,3): 1\n\n- (3,5): 2\n\nWait, actually, (1,4) is a 3, which is already revealed.\n\nNow, considering that (2,4) is a 3, and it's adjacent to several other numbers, I need to see if I can find a pattern or deduce the positions of the bombs.\n\nLet me also look at row 2, column 5: it's a 3.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,4): 3\n\n- (1,5): .\n\n- (1,6): .\n\n- (2,4): 3\n\n- (2,6): .\n\n- (3,4): 1\n\n- (3,5): 2\n\n- (3,6): 3\n\nSo, for row 2, column 5 (3):\n\n- Adjacent squares:\n\n- (1,4): 3\n\n- (1,5): .\n\n- (1,6): .\n\n- (2,4): 3\n\n- (2,6): .\n\n- (3,4): 1\n\n- (3,5): 2\n\n- (3,6): 3\n\nHmm, a bit complicated. Maybe I should look at row 3, column 4: it's a 1.\n\nWait, row 3, column 4 is a 1.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,3): 1\n\n- (2,4): 1\n\n- (2,5): 3\n\n- (3,3): 1\n\n- (3,5): 2\n\n- (4,3): .\n\n- (4,4): .\n\n- (4,5): .\n\nSo, for row 3, column 4 (1):\n\n- Adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,3): 1\n\n- (2,4): 1\n\n- (2,5): 3\n\n- (3,3): 1\n\n- (3,5): 2\n\n- (4,3): .\n\n- (4,4): .\n\n- (4,5): .\n\nNow, since it's a 1, there should be exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at these adjacent squares, none of them are flagged yet, and some are unexplored.\n\nThis might not be immediately helpful, so maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet me consider row 3, column 6: it's a 3.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,5): 3\n\n- (2,6): .\n\n- (2,7): .\n\n- (3,5): 2\n\n- (3,7): 2\n\n- (4,5): .\n\n- (4,6): 1\n\n- (4,7): 2\n\nSo, for row 3, column 6 (3):\n\n- Adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,5): 3\n\n- (2,6): .\n\n- (2,7): .\n\n- (3,5): 2\n\n- (3,7): 2\n\n- (4,5): .\n\n- (4,6): 1\n\n- (4,7): 2\n\nAgain, a bit complex. Maybe I should look for a simpler scenario.\n\nLet's check row 4, column 2: it's a 1.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (3,1): unexplored\n\n- (3,2): 1\n\n- (3,3): 1\n\n- (4,1): unexplored\n\n- (4,3): unexplored\n\n- (5,1): unexplored\n\n- (5,2): 1\n\n- (5,3): 2\n\nSo, for row 4, column 2 (1):\n\n- Adjacent squares:\n\n- (3,1): .\n\n- (3,2): 1\n\n- (3,3): 1\n\n- (4,1): .\n\n- (4,3): .\n\n- (5,1): .\n\n- (5,2): 1\n\n- (5,3): 2\n\nNow, since it's a 1, and none of these adjacent squares are flagged, there must be exactly one bomb in these adjacent unexplored squares.\n\nThis seems promising, but I need to see if I can isolate which one is likely to be the bomb.\n\nSimilarly, row 5, column 2 is a 1, and row 5, column 3 is a 2.\n\nThis seems like it could be a chain, but it's getting a bit too involved for my current understanding.\n\nMaybe I should look at the bottom part of the board, where there are some unexplored areas with fewer complexities.\n\nLooking at row 6 and row 7, columns 2,3,4 are all unexplored or blank (_), and columns 5 and above are mostly unexplored.\n\nWait, row 6, column 5 is unexplored (.), and rows 6 and 7, columns 6 to 9 are all unexplored.\n\nThis seems like a large unexplored area. Maybe I can try to reveal a square there, but I need to be careful not to step on a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to deduce whether certain squares in this area are safe or not based on the numbers I've already revealed.\n\nLet me consider the fact that there are 10 bombs in total, and 9 flags remaining, meaning that one flag has already been placed at (0,3).\n\nAssuming that the flagged square is correct, that accounts for one bomb, so there are 9 bombs left to be flagged.\n\nBut since there are only 9 flags remaining, that means that all the other bombs must be in the unflagged squares.\n\nI need to ensure that I place the remaining flags only on squares that are actually bombs, without exceeding the total number of bombs.\n\nNow, going back to row 1, column 4 (3), which has one flagged adjacent square at (0,3), and needs two more bombs in its adjacent unexplored squares.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 4 (3) needs three bombs in its adjacent squares, but some of them are already numbers, so I need to see which ones could be bombs.\n\nThis is getting a bit too complicated for me right now. Maybe I should look for a square that is definitely safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 2: it's unexplored (.), and it's adjacent to row 5, column 2, which is a 1.\n\nWait, row 5, column 2 is a 1, and its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,1): .\n\n- (4,2): .\n\n- (4,3): .\n\n- (5,1): .\n\n- (5,3): 2\n\n- (6,1): .\n\n- (6,2): .\n\n- (6,3): .\n\nSince it's a 1, and none of these are flagged, there must be exactly one bomb in these adjacent unexplored squares.\n\nSo, among these 8 adjacent squares, only one is a bomb.\n\nIf I can find a way to determine which one is the bomb, I can safely reveal the others.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find a group of squares where the number of possible bomb locations matches the number of bombs needed, I can flag them accordingly.\n\nThis seems a bit advanced for my current skill level, so maybe I should just pick a square that seems safe based on the numbers I see.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 2: it's adjacent to row 5, column 2 (1), and row 5, column 3 (2).\n\nBut since row 5, column 2 is a 1, and it needs only one bomb in its adjacent squares, and row 5, column 3 is a 2, which needs two bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nWait, row 5, column 3 (2) has adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,2): .\n\n- (4,3): .\n\n- (4,4): .\n\n- (5,2): 1\n\n- (5,4): .\n\n- (6,2): .\n\n- (6,3): .\n\n- (6,4): .\n\nSo, for row 5, column 3 (2), there should be two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut row 5, column 2 (1) has one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nIf I can find overlapping areas where the bomb counts match, I might be able to deduce something.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider the possibility that row 6, column 2 is safe to reveal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place a flag on a square that is likely to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking back at row 1, column 4 (3), which has one flagged adjacent square at (0,3), and needs two more bombs in its adjacent unexplored squares: (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 4 (3) needs three bombs in its adjacent squares, but some of them are already numbers.\n\nWait, row 2, column 4 (3) has adjacent squares:\n\n- (1,3): .\n\n- (1,5): .\n\n- (2,3): 1\n\n- (2,5): 3\n\n- (3,3): 1\n\n- (3,5): 2\n\nSo, only (1,3) and (1,5) are unexplored.\n\nBut row 1, column 4 (3) already needs two more bombs, and row 2, column 4 (3) needs three bombs in its adjacent squares, but only two unexplored squares are available.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, row 2, column 4 (3) is adjacent to:\n\n- (1,3): .\n\n- (1,4): 3\n\n- (1,5): .\n\n- (2,3): 1\n\n- (2,5): 3\n\n- (3,3): 1\n\n- (3,4): 1\n\n- (3,5): 2\n\nSo, only (1,3) and (1,5) are unexplored.\n\nBut row 1, column 4 (3) needs two more bombs, and row 2, column 4 (3) needs three bombs in its adjacent squares, but only two unexplored squares are available.\n\nThis suggests that both (1,3) and (1,5) are bombs.\n\nBut wait, row 1, column 4 (3) would have its two required bombs in (1,3) and (1,5), and row 2, column 4 (3) would have its three bombs in (1,3), (1,5), and possibly one of the revealed numbers, but revealed numbers can't be bombs.\n\nWait, no, revealed numbers can't be bombs, so if row 2, column 4 (3) needs three bombs in its adjacent squares, and only (1,3) and (1,5) are unexplored, that would require both to be bombs, and one of the revealed squares to be a bomb, which can't be.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that row 2, column 4 (3) is getting its count from the flagged square at (0,3), plus the unexplored squares.\n\nWait, (0,3) is flagged, which is adjacent to row 1, column 4 (3), but not to row 2, column 4 (3). The adjacent squares for row 2, column 4 (3) are (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5).\n\nNone of these are flagged, so all three bombs needed must be in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut only (1,3) and (1,5) are unexplored; the rest are numbers.\n\nThis suggests that both (1,3) and (1,5) are bombs, and one of the revealed numbers is a bomb, which can't be.\n\nThis inconsistency means I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nPerhaps the flagged square at (0,3) is not actually a bomb, or maybe there are more bombs in other adjacent squares.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for me right now. Maybe I should look elsewhere on the board.\n\nLooking at the bottom part, row 8, column 2 is a 1, and row 8, column 3 is a 1.\n\nTheir adjacent squares are:\n\nFor row 8, column 2 (1):\n\n- (7,1): .\n\n- (7,2): _\n\n- (7,3): _\n\n- (8,1): .\n\n- (8,3): 1\n\n- (9,1): .\n\n- (9,2): 1\n\n- (9,3): 1\n\nFor row 8, column 3 (1):\n\n- (7,2): _\n\n- (7,3): _\n\n- (7,4): .\n\n- (8,2): 1\n\n- (8,4): .\n\n- (9,2): 1\n\n- (9,3): 1\n\n- (9,4): .\n\nNow, for row 8, column 2 (1), there should be one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, row 8, column 3 (1) also needs one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nIf I can find a square that is adjacent to both of these '1's, and is unexplored, then that square is likely to be the bomb.\n\nLooking at the adjacent squares, the overlapping unexplored squares are (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), and (9,3).\n\nBut (9,3) is a 1, which is already revealed, so it can't be a bomb.\n\nSo, among (7,1), (8,1), and (9,1), there must be one bomb to satisfy both '1's.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that one of these three squares is a bomb, and the other two are safe.\n\nSince I have to choose one to flag and the others to reveal, but I don't know which one is the bomb, I need a way to determine which one is likely to be the bomb.\n\nLooking further, row 9, column 2 is a 1, and row 9, column 3 is a 1.\n\nTheir adjacent squares are:\n\nFor row 9, column 2 (1):\n\n- (8,1): .\n\n- (8,2): 1\n\n- (8,3): 1\n\n- (9,1): .\n\n- (9,3): 1\n\n- (10,1): out of bounds\n\n- (10,2): out of bounds\n\n- (10,3): out of bounds\n\nSo, for row 9, column 2 (1), the adjacent squares are (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), and (9,3).\n\nSimilarly, row 9, column 3 (1) has adjacent squares (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2), (10,3): but (10,2) and (10,3) are out of bounds.\n\nGiven that, and considering that (8,2) and (9,2) are both 1's, and (8,3) and (9,3) are both 1's, it seems like there's a pattern here.\n\nIf I assume that (8,1) and (9,1) are safe, and (7,1) is the bomb, then I need to see if that satisfies all the '1's in the area.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Maybe I should consider that since there are three possible squares: (7,1), (8,1), and (9,1), and one of them is a bomb, I can flag one of them and see if it makes sense.\n\nBut I only have 9 flags left, and I need to use them wisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a different area of the board where I can make safer moves.\n\nLooking back at the top part of the board, there's a cluster of numbers around rows 1 to 3.\n\nI already tried to analyze that area, but it was too complex.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the flagged square at (0,3) is correct, and proceed from there.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that row 1, column 4 (3) needs two more bombs in its adjacent squares, which are (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5).\n\nIf I assume that (1,3) and (1,5) are bombs, then that satisfies the row 1, column 4 (3).\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 4 (3) would have its three bombs in (1,3), (1,5), and possibly another square.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent because row 2, column 4 (3) only has two unexplored adjacent squares, and it needs three bombs.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption is wrong.\n\nPerhaps only one of (1,3) and (1,5) is a bomb, and the other bomb is in another adjacent square.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total number of bombs and flags.\n\nThere are 10 bombs in total, and 9 flags remaining, meaning one flag has already been placed.\n\nIf that flag is correct, then there are 9 bombs left to be flagged.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't flag more than necessary and that I don't step on any bombs.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should look for a square that is probably safe to reveal, based on the numbers I see.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 2: it's unexplored, and it's adjacent to row 5, column 2 (1), which needs one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nIf I reveal row 6, column 2, and it's a bomb, then I lose.\n\nBut perhaps the probability is low, given that there are still many unexplored squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag on a square that is likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 4 (3), which needs two more bombs in its adjacent squares: (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5).\n\nIf I flag one of these, I need to make sure it's correct.\n\nBut I'm not sure which one is the bomb.\n\nPerhaps I should flag both (1,3) and (1,5), but that might not be accurate.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe I should make a safer move elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 2 (1), with adjacent unexplored squares: (3,1), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1).\n\nIf I assume that one of these four squares is a bomb, and the others are safe, perhaps I can reveal one of the less risky squares.\n\nBut I still don't have enough information to be certain.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability and choose a square that has the least chance of being a bomb.\n\nGiven that there are 9 bombs left and many unexplored squares, the probability might be low in certain areas.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 5: it's unexplored, and it's adjacent to row 5, column 5 (which is unexplored), row 5, column 6 (unexplored), row 6, column 4 (unexplored), row 7, column 5 (unexplored), etc.\n\nThis seems like a relatively safe area, as it's away from the clusters of numbers.\n\nPerhaps I should reveal row 6, column 5.\n\nBut before doing that, I should check if there are any numbers adjacent to this area that might indicate the presence of bombs.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5: it's unexplored.\n\nRow 5, column 6: unexplored.\n\nRow 6, column 4: unexplored.\n\nRow 6, column 6: unexplored.\n\nRow 7, column 5: unexplored.\n\nThere are no numbers adjacent to these squares yet, so revealing any of them could be risky, but perhaps necessary to progress.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should reveal row 6, column 5.\n\nIf it's safe, it might reveal a number that can help me deduce more about the surrounding squares.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a bomb, I lose the game.\n\nGiven that, and considering that I have to take some risk, I think I'll choose to reveal row 6, column 5.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed in the Minesweeper game, the next step is to reveal a safe square or place a flag correctly without hitting a bomb. Given the current board state and the analysis, the best move is to reveal a square in a less risky area.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAfter analyzing the board, areas with clusters of numbers and flags appear complex, making it difficult to determine exact bomb positions. The bottom part of the board, specifically row 6, column 5, seems relatively safer as it is away from the clusters and has no adjacent numbers indicating immediate danger.\n\nBy choosing to reveal row 6, column 5, we aim to gather more information about the surrounding squares, which can help in making further moves with greater certainty.\n\n**Move:**\n\nReveal the square at row 6, column 5.\n\n```plaintext\nMOVE: 6,5,false\n```", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 F . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 . 3 . . . . .\n2 _ _ 1 1 3 3 . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 1 2 . 3 2 . .\n4 _ _ 1 . . 1 2 . . .\n5 _ _ 1 2 . 1 1 1 . .\n6 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n7 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n8 _ _ 1 1 . . . . . .\n9 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 3, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. I need to be careful and make sure I don't step on any bombs.\n\nFirst, I should look at the areas where I have some numbers revealed and see if I can deduce where the bombs are based on those numbers. Let's start from the top-left corner and work our way across.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Column 2 has a '1', which means there is one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). Currently, (0,3) is flagged, so that's one bomb accounted for. So, the '1' at (0,2) should have only one bomb next to it, which is already flagged at (0,3). That means the other adjacent squares should be safe. So, I can probably reveal (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3), but I need to check if any of those are already revealed or have flags.\n\nWait, (0,3) is flagged, and (0,2) is '1', which is satisfied. So, the other adjacent squares should be safe. Let's see:\n\n- (0,1): It's empty, so revealing it should be safe.\n\n- (1,1): It's empty, so revealing it should be safe.\n\n- (1,2): It's '1', which is already revealed.\n\n- (1,3): It's '.', so unexplored.\n\nBut wait, (1,3) is adjacent to (1,2), which is '.', so I need to be careful. Maybe I should first reveal (0,1) and (1,1).\n\nLet me check another area. Looking at row 1:\n\n- (1,4) is '3', which means there are three bombs adjacent to it. Adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). Currently, (0,3) is flagged, and the rest are either '.' or '1's.\n\nHmm, (0,3) is flagged, which is one bomb. So, there need to be two more bombs adjacent to (1,4). So, among (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), there should be two bombs.\n\nBut I don't have enough information yet to determine exactly where those two bombs are. Maybe I should look at another number.\n\nLooking at (1,6): '3', which means three bombs adjacent to it. Adjacent squares are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). Currently, (0,5) is '.', (0,6) is '2', (0,7) is '_', (1,5) is '.', (1,7) is '1', (2,5) is '.', (2,6) is '.', (2,7) is '_'.\n\nSo, (0,6) is '2', which means two bombs adjacent to it. Adjacent squares are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). Currently, (1,6) is '3', which is already considered.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for areas where I can safely reveal tiles without risking a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n- (2,2) is '1', with adjacent squares (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Currently, (1,1) is '_', (1,2) is '1', (1,3) is '1', (2,1) is '_', (2,3) is '1', (3,1) is '_', (3,2) is '1', (3,3) is '1'.\n\nSo, (2,2) is '1', and it's surrounded by mostly '_' and '1's. No flags around it, so I need to be careful.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe I should look for a place where the number of adjacent flags matches the number, allowing me to reveal the other tiles.\n\nLooking back at (0,2): '1', with one adjacent flag at (0,3). So, the other adjacent tiles should be safe.\n\nSo, I can probably reveal (0,1), (1,1), and (1,2).\n\nWait, but (1,2) is already revealed as '1'. So, maybe reveal (0,1) and (1,1).\n\nLet me check the state of (0,1) and (1,1):\n\n- (0,1): It's '_', which means it's already revealed as empty.\n\nWait, actually, in the board legend, '_' represents an empty revealed space, not unexplored. So, (0,1) is already revealed as empty.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify the board legend again.\n\nBOARD LEGEND:\n\n- _ : Empty revealed space\n\n- . : Unexplored space\n\n- F : Flagged space\n\n- * : Revealed bomb (game over)\n\n- 1-8: Number indicating adjacent bombs\n\nSo, in row 0:\n\n- (0,0): '_'\n\n- (0,1): '_'\n\n- (0,2): '1'\n\n- (0,3): 'F'\n\n- (0,4): '.'\n\n- (0,5): '.'\n\n- (0,6): '2'\n\n- (0,7): '_'\n\n- (0,8): '_'\n\n- (0,9): '_'\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nSo, in row 0:\n\n- (0,0) and (0,1) are empty revealed spaces.\n\n- (0,2) is '1'.\n\n- (0,3) is flagged.\n\n- (0,4) and (0,5) are unexplored.\n\n- (0,6) is '2'.\n\n- (0,7), (0,8), (0,9) are empty revealed spaces.\n\nOkay, so back to (0,2): '1', with one adjacent flag at (0,3). The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,1): '_'\n\n- (0,3): 'F'\n\n- (1,1): '_'\n\n- (1,2): '1'\n\n- (1,3): '.'\n\nSo, (0,1) and (1,1) are already revealed as empty, and (0,3) is flagged. Since the '1' at (0,2) has one adjacent flag, the other adjacent squares should be safe. So, (1,2) is already revealed as '1', and (1,3) is unexplored.\n\nWait, but (1,2) is '1', which means it has one adjacent bomb. Adjacent to (1,2):\n\n- (0,1): '_'\n\n- (0,2): '1'\n\n- (0,3): 'F'\n\n- (1,1): '_'\n\n- (1,3): '.'\n\n- (2,1): '_'\n\n- (2,2): '1'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\nSo, (1,2) is '1', and it has one adjacent flag at (0,3). So, no other bombs should be adjacent to it. Therefore, (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) should be safe.\n\nWait, but (2,2) and (2,3) are already '1's, which means they have one adjacent bomb each.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nI think I should look for areas where the number of adjacent flags equals the number, allowing me to safely reveal the remaining adjacent unexplored tiles.\n\nLooking at (0,6): '2', which means two adjacent bombs. Adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,5): '.'\n\n- (0,7): '_'\n\n- (1,5): '.'\n\n- (1,6): '3'\n\n- (1,7): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '.'\n\n- (2,6): '.'\n\n- (2,7): '_'\n\nCurrently, no flags are adjacent to (0,6). So, there should be two bombs among these adjacent squares.\n\nBut I don't have any flags here, so I can't deduce anything yet.\n\nLooking at (1,6): '3', which should have three adjacent bombs. Adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,5): '.'\n\n- (0,6): '2'\n\n- (0,7): '_'\n\n- (1,5): '.'\n\n- (1,7): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '.'\n\n- (2,6): '.'\n\n- (2,7): '_'\n\nAgain, no flags here. So, can't deduce yet.\n\nLooking at (1,4): '3', adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,3): 'F'\n\n- (0,4): '.'\n\n- (0,5): '.'\n\n- (1,3): '.'\n\n- (1,5): '.'\n\n- (2,3): '.'\n\n- (2,4): '.'\n\n- (2,5): '.'\n\nIt has one adjacent flag at (0,3), so need two more bombs in the remaining adjacent squares.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to pinpoint their locations.\n\nMaybe I should look for a place where the number of possible bomb locations is equal to the number needed, allowing me to place flags there.\n\nLooking at row 5:\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\n- (5,4): '2'\n\n- (5,5): '2'\n\n- (5,6): '1'\n\n- (5,7): '1'\n\n- (5,8): '1'\n\n- (5,9): '1'\n\nThis seems like a row with multiple numbers. Maybe I can find some relationships there.\n\nLooking at (5,3): '1', adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,2): '_'\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\n- (4,4): '.'\n\n- (5,2): '_'\n\n- (5,4): '2'\n\n- (6,2): '_'\n\n- (6,3): '_'\n\n- (6,4): '.'\n\nSo, (5,3) is '1', and adjacent squares include some revealed spaces and numbers.\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe I should look for a simpler scenario.\n\nLooking back at the top-left corner:\n\n- (0,2): '1', with one adjacent flag at (0,3). So, the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\n- Therefore, (1,2): '1' is already revealed.\n\n- (1,3): '.' is unexplored.\n\nBut (1,3) is adjacent to (1,2): '1', which already has one adjacent flag at (0,3). So, no more bombs should be adjacent to (1,2). Therefore, (1,3) should be safe to reveal.\n\nWait, but (1,3) is adjacent to (1,2): '1', which has its required bomb already accounted for at (0,3). So, (1,3) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3): '1', adjacent to (1,2): '1', which is satisfied. So, (2,3) should also be safe.\n\nWait, but (2,3) is already '1', which means it has one adjacent bomb.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider (1,3): '.' , which is adjacent to (1,2): '1', which has one adjacent flag at (0,3). So, no more bombs can be adjacent to (1,2). Therefore, (1,3) should be safe to reveal.\n\nSo, I can reveal (1,3).\n\nSimilarly, (2,3): '1', which has one adjacent flag at (1,2): '1' (which is satisfied), so the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nWait, but (2,3) is already '1', meaning it has one adjacent bomb.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for areas with higher numbers and more adjacent flags.\n\nLooking at (1,6): '3', which should have three adjacent bombs. Adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,5): '.'\n\n- (0,6): '2'\n\n- (0,7): '_'\n\n- (1,5): '.'\n\n- (1,7): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '.'\n\n- (2,6): '.'\n\n- (2,7): '_'\n\nCurrently, no flags are adjacent to (1,6). So, all three bombs must be among these adjacent squares.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine which ones are bombs.\n\nWait, but (0,6): '2' is adjacent to (1,6): '3'. So, if (0,6): '2' has two adjacent bombs, and (1,6): '3' has three adjacent bombs, and they share some adjacent squares, maybe I can find overlapping areas.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for me right now. Maybe I should just pick a safe spot to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 6:\n\n- (6,3): '_'\n\n- (6,4): '1'\n\n- (6,5): '1'\n\n- (6,6): '1'\n\n- (6,7): '_'\n\n- (6,8): '_'\n\n- (6,9): '_'\n\nSo, (6,4): '1', adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\n- (5,4): '2'\n\n- (5,5): '2'\n\n- (6,3): '_'\n\n- (6,5): '1'\n\n- (7,3): '_'\n\n- (7,4): '1'\n\n- (7,5): '1'\n\nNow, (6,4): '1' should have one adjacent bomb. Adjacent squares include some revealed numbers and empty spaces.\n\nThis seems tricky as well.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total number of flags left and the number of possible bomb locations.\n\nCurrently, there are 9 flags remaining, and 10 bombs in total, meaning one flag has already been placed at (0,3).\n\nI need to place the remaining 9 flags on the actual bombs.\n\nBut with so many unexplored squares, it's hard to pinpoint exact locations.\n\nPerhaps I should look for areas where the number of unexplored squares equals the number of bombs needed.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n- (1,4): '3', with adjacent squares having two bombs needed (since one is already flagged at (0,3)).\n\n- Adjacent unexplored squares are (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nThat's seven squares, needing two bombs. But that's too broad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for isolated areas where the number of unexplored squares matches the number of bombs needed.\n\nBut I don't see any such areas immediately.\n\nPerhaps I should just reveal a safe-looking square to get more information.\n\nLooking at (1,3): '.', which is adjacent to (1,2): '1', which is satisfied with the flag at (0,3). So, (1,3) should be safe.\n\nSo, I'll go ahead and reveal (1,3).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The square at (1,3) is adjacent to (1,2), which is a '1' and already has one adjacent flag at (0,3). Therefore, no more bombs can be adjacent to (1,2), making (1,3) safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,3,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 F . . 2 _ _ _\n1 _ _ 1 . 3 . 3 1 _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 3 3 . 1 _ _\n3 _ _ 1 1 2 . 3 2 1 _\n4 _ _ 1 . . 1 2 . 1 _\n5 _ _ 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n6 _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ _\n7 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _\n8 _ _ 1 1 . 1 1 1 _ _\n9 _ _ 1 . . . . 1 _ _", "sucess": false}
