There are 10 bombs on the board, meaning 10% of the squares contain bombs. I need to make my first move.\n\nIn Minesweeper, the first move is always important as it sets up the rest of the game. The best strategy for the first move is typically to choose a square that has the highest probability of being empty and also opening up a large area.\n\nFor a 10x10 board with 10 bombs, any square has a 10/100 = 1/10 chance of containing a bomb. However, in many Minesweeper implementations, the first click is guaranteed to be safe. But I shouldn't rely on that here.\n\nFor the first move in Minesweeper, it's often good to start near the middle of the board rather than at the edges or corners. This is because a central move has more adjacent squares and thus more potential to open up a larger area.\n\nSo, a good first move would be somewhere near the center of the board, like (4,4) or (5,5).\n\nI'll choose (4,4) (which is the 5th row, 5th column) and reveal it (flag=false).\n\nIs there anything I'm missing? Let me think again:\n\n1. The board is unexplored, so I don't have any information about which squares contain bombs.\n2. There are 10 bombs on a 10x10 board.\n3. I want to make a move that maximizes the chances of opening a large area.\n4. A corner move (like 0,0 or 9,9) is less optimal since it has fewer adjacent squares.\n5. A center move (like 4,4 or 5,5) is more optimal.\n\nI'll go with revealing (4,4).\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Move Analysis\n\nLooking at a completely unexplored 10x10 board with 10 bombs, I need to make my first move carefully.\n\n## Strategy for First Move\nWhen starting a Minesweeper game, the optimal first move is generally near the center of the board rather than at edges or corners. A center move:\n- Has more adjacent squares (8 vs 5 at edges or 3 at corners)\n- Provides better chances of opening a large area\n- Creates more information to work with for subsequent moves\n\nFor a 10x10 board with 10 bombs, any square has a 10% chance of containing a bomb. However, starting in the center maximizes the potential for revealing a larger safe area.\n\nEXPLANATION: I'll choose a center square (4,4) for my first move to maximize the chance of opening a large area and gaining useful information about the board.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
