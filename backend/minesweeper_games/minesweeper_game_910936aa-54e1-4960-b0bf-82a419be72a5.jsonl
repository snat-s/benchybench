It is adjacent to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). We\u2019ll look for flags around these positions.\n- Tile (4,1) has a '2', meaning there are two bombs adjacent to it. It's adjacent to (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), and (5,2). It is also important to check for flags here.\n- Tile (4,2) = '1' indicates one adjacent bomb, indicating there should only be one bomb between (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (5,1) and (5,2).\n- Tile (5,4) = '2' indicates two adjacent bombs as well.\n\nGiven this information:\n- (4,1) currently shows one adjacent flag at (5,1). This is still consistent since it still allows for one more bomb adjacent to it.\n- (4,2) needs careful attention. It should have one bomb among its surrounding tiles (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (5,1), and (5,2). One potential danger is that if we count flags and surrounding numbers, we can see that some conflicts can arise.\n\n**Safest Move**:\n- Since the tiles near the flagged positions don\u2019t demonstrate any immediate conflicts and would lead toward revealing tiles for safe zones, I will reveal tile (2,4).\n\n**Move Explanation**:\nRevealing (2,4) does not violate any conditions as it is not adjacent to any flagged bombs and could potentially uncover more information to help solve nearby tiles.\n\n**FINAL MOVE**:\nMOVE: 2,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ 1 2 . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 _ 1 . . 2 1 _ _ _ _\n6 _ 2 . . . 3 1 _ _ _\n7 _ 1 . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n8 _ 1 1 2 3 . 3 2 2 .\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 3, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "To analyze the current board state, we can start by checking the revealed numbers and the adjacent flags, and see if there are any conflicts or opportunities to place flags or reveal tiles.\n\nHere are the key observations based on the counts of adjacent bombs indicated by the revealed numbers:\n\n1. At position (3, 2) and (3, 3), there is a number '1'. Both positions have only one adjacent flag (the one at (4, 1)), which indicates there should be no additional bombs adjacent to either.\n2. At position (4, 1), there is a number '2'. It has one adjacent flag (at (4, 1)) and thus requires one more bomb nearby. Currently, flags are placed at positions (4, 1) and possibly (3, 1) since (3, 1) is adjacent and can lead to a conflict with the '1' at (3, 2) and (3, 3).\n3. The number '2' at position (5, 4) has an adjacent flag at position (4, 4) and still needs one more bomb in adjacent squares.\n4. The number '3' at position (6, 5) currently has one adjacent flag at (5, 4), meaning it must have two other bombs among its adjacent positions.\n\nConsidering all information, it seems at position (4, 3), there is no revealed number, and it has the potential to be a safe tile or a bomb.\n\nTo play it safe, I will reveal the tile at position (4, 3) since it does not conflict with the numbers around (4, 1) which will help clarify the existence of the other bombs without risking flagging conflicts.\n\nEXPLANATION: Reveal the tile at (4, 3) to see if it is safe, as it's not directly indicated by surrounding numbers.\nMOVE: 4,3,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ 1 2 . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n5 _ 1 . . 2 1 _ _ _ _\n6 _ 2 . . . 3 1 _ _ _\n7 _ 1 . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n8 _ 1 1 2 3 . 3 2 2 .\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": false}
