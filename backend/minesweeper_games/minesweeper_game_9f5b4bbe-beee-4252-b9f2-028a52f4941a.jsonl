{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Let's analyze the current board state to make the next move.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\n- The revealed squares are providing clues about bomb placement via the numbers visible on adjacent squares.\n- We need to ensure that we don't violate the critical flag placement rules based on visible numbers.\n\n### Visible Numbers and Flags Analysis:\n1. **Row 0 (y=5):** \n   - `(0,6)` has `1` which has no flags adjacent yet. Therefore, it can have 1 bomb.\n   \n2. **Row 1 (y=5):**\n   - `(1,5)` has `1`, but has no flags adjacent. Thus, it can have 1 bomb.\n   - `(1,6)` has `2`, and it already has one potential neighboring bomb (because of the `1` at `(0,6)` or potentially `(0,5)`) so one more must be flagged adjacent to it. \n\n3. **Row 2 and 3:** \n   - Both rows show numbers that can help us deduce bomb locations based on proximity to flagged/numbered tiles.\n\n### Assessing Flag Placement:\n- The `2` at `(1,6)` needs two bombs adjacent, but it currently shows `1` adjacent bomb potentially from `(0,6)`. This means we need more bombs adjacently placed to `(1,6)`. \n- The `1` at `(1,5)` has 0 adjacent flags, suggesting it can only potentially support one bomb.\n\n### Optimal Next Move:\nLooking through the board, we have the highest certainty for placement by revealing a square, as many positions still remain hidden. Flag placements can be awaited once we reveal more information.\n\nThe `0` at `(6, 0)` may lead to a chain reveal since it has no adjacent bombs leading to adjacent reveals. It has neighbors at `(5,0)` and `(7,0)`. \n\nTherefore:\n- **Next Move:** Reveal the tile at `(0, 7)`, which is currently unexplored (`.`), because it likely won't have a bomb (given the numbers in the other squares may mean it's adjacent to safe, revealed areas).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (0,7) is safe likely based on surrounding numbers which don't suggest a bomb there, allowing us to reveal more and gain information without risking hitting a bomb.\nMOVE: 0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . . .\n4 _ _ 2 . . . . . . .\n5 _ _ 2 . . . . . . .\n6 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n7 1 1 1 . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Hence, I will place a flag.\n\nEXPLANATION: I am placing a flag at (4,3) to satisfy the number requirement of 2.
