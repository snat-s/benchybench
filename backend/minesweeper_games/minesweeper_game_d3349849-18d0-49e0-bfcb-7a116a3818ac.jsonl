First, in row 3, column 1, there's a revealed '1' which must refer to the bomb we already flagged at (6,0). There's also a '1' at (4,0) which similarly must refer to the flag at (6,0). Looking at the corners of the board, position (8,0) is definitely safe to reveal because the '3' at (7,1) is already satisfied by the three flags surrounding it at (6,0), (6,2), and (7,3). The position (8,0) is not adjacent to any number that would suggest it contains a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 8,0,false", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n3 . 1 _ _ 1 . 1 1 1 1\n4 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n6 _ F F 2 1 _ _ _ _ _\n7 F 3 F . 1 1 1 1 _ _\n8 . . . . . . . 2 1 1\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
