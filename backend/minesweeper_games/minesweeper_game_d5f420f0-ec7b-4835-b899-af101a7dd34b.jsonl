{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "### Step 1: Check all revealed numbers against existing flags\nFirst, I'll scan the board to see if any revealed numbers already have the correct number of adjacent flags. If a number matches the count of adjacent flags, then all other adjacent unexplored tiles are safe to reveal.\n\n### Step 2: Look for obvious conflicts\nNext, I'll look for any numbers that have more adjacent flags than the number indicates, which would be a conflict. For example, if a '1' has two adjacent flags, that's impossible and indicates a mistake.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\nThere are 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs on the board. This means that every flag placed should correspond to a bomb, and we need to ensure that we don't place flags unnecessarily.\n\n### Step 4: Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile\nBased on the above steps, I'll determine the safest move, whether it's placing a flag on a suspected bomb or revealing a tile that is guaranteed to be safe.\n\n### Analyzing the Board\n\nLet's go through the board row by row:\n\n**Row 0:**\n- (0,1): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n- (0,3): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\n**Row 1:**\n- (1,1): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n- (1,3): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n**Row 2:**\n- (2,1): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n- (2,2): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n- (2,3): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n- (2,6): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n- (2,7): '2' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8)\n- (2,8): '2' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)\n- (2,9): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (1,8), (1,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9)\n\n**Row 3:**\n- (3,6): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n- (3,7): '.'

(unexplored)\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves\n\nLooking at the board, I notice that at position (2,7), there's a '2' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). Since there are no flags adjacent to (2,7), and it shows '2', there must be exactly two bombs in these adjacent tiles.\n\nSimilarly, at position (2,8), there's a '2' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). Again, no flags are adjacent, so there must be exactly two bombs in these tiles.\n\nHowever, without more information, it's hard to determine exactly where the bombs are. Therefore, I'll look for other areas where the number of adjacent unexplored tiles equals the number of bombs indicated, which would allow me to place flags confidently.\n\n### Placing Flags\n\nAt position (4,7), there's a '3' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). Since there are no flags adjacent to (4,7), and it shows '3', there must be exactly three bombs in these adjacent tiles.\n\nLooking at the adjacent tiles:\n- (3,6): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n- (3,7): '.' (unexplored)\n- (3,8): '.' (unexplored)\n- (4,6): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n- (4,8): '.' (unexplored)\n- (5,6): '.' (unexplored)\n- (5,7): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)\n- (5,8): '.' (unexplored)\n\nGiven that (4,7) shows '3', and there are eight adjacent unexplored tiles, it's not immediately clear where the bombs are. Therefore, I'll look for another area.\n\nAt position (7,3), there's a '2' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). Since there are no flags adjacent to (7,3), and it shows '2', there must be exactly two bombs in these adjacent tiles.\n\nLooking at the adjacent tiles:\n- (6,2): '.' (unexplored)\n- (6,3): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n- (6,4): '.' (unexplored)\n- (7,2): '.' (unexplored)\n- (7,4): '.' (unexplored)\n- (8,2): '.' (unexplored)\n- (8,3): '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n- (8,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\nAgain, without more information, it's difficult to place flags here. Therefore, I'll look for a safer move.\n\n### Revealing a Safe Tile\n\nAt position (0,0), it's an empty revealed space ('_') with adjacent unexplored tiles at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Since (0,1) is a '1' and (1,1) is a '1', and there are no flags adjacent to them, it's safe to reveal (0,0).\n\nHowever, (0,0) is already revealed as empty, so I'll look for another safe tile.\n\nAt position (1,0), it's an empty revealed space ('_') with adjacent unexplored tiles at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0). Since (0,1) is a '1' and (1,1) is a '1', and there are no flags adjacent to them, it's safe to reveal (1,0).\n\nBut (1,0) is also already revealed as empty. I'll continue searching.\n\nAt position (2,0), it's an empty revealed space ('_') with adjacent unexplored tiles at (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0). Since (2,1) is a '1' and there are no flags adjacent to it, it's safe to reveal (2,0).\n\nHowever, (2,0) is already revealed as empty. I'll look for another safe tile.\n\nAt position (3,0), it's an empty revealed space ('_') with adjacent unexplored tiles at (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0). Since (2,1) is a '1' and there are no flags adjacent to it, it's safe to reveal (3,0).\n\nBut (3,0) is already revealed as empty. I'll continue searching.\n\nAt position (4,0), it's an empty revealed space ('_') with adjacent unexplored tiles at (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0). Since there are no numbers adjacent to (4,0), it's safe to reveal (4,0).\n\nHowever, (4,0) is already revealed as empty. I'll look for another safe tile.\n\nAt position (5,0), it's an empty revealed space ('_') with adjacent unexplored tiles at (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0). Since there are no numbers adjacent to (5,0), it's safe to reveal (5,0).\n\nBut (5,0) is already revealed as empty. I'll continue searching.\n\nAt position (6,0), it's an empty revealed space ('_') with adjacent unexplored tiles at (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0). Since (7,0) is a '1' and there are no flags adjacent to it, it's safe to reveal (6,0).\n\nHowever, (6,0) is already revealed as empty. I'll look for another safe tile.\n\nAt position (7,0), it's a '1' with adjacent unexplored tiles at (6,-1), (6,0), (6,1), (7,-1), (7,1), (8,-1), (8,0), (8,1). Since (6,0) is already revealed as empty, and (7,1) is a '1', and there are no flags adjacent to (7,0), it's safe to reveal (7,0).\n\nBut (7,0) is already revealed as '1'. I'll continue searching.\n\nAt position (8,0), it's an empty revealed space ('_') with adjacent unexplored tiles at (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0). Since (7,1) is a '1' and there are no flags adjacent to it, it's safe to reveal (8,0).\n\nHowever, (8,0) is already revealed as empty. I'll look for another safe tile.\n\nAt position (9,0), it's an empty revealed space ('_') with adjacent unexplored tiles at (8,0), (8,1), (9,1). Since (9,1) is a '1' and there are no flags adjacent to it, it's safe to reveal (9,0).\n\nBut (9,0) is already revealed as empty. I'll continue searching.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the board, I couldn't find any immediate safe moves or obvious flag placements. Therefore, I'll choose to reveal a tile that has the least risk based on the current information.\n\nLooking at position (3,7), it's an unexplored tile adjacent to (3,6) which is a '1'. Since (3,6) shows '1' and there are no flags adjacent to it, revealing (3,7) is a relatively safe move.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Revealing (3,7) is a safe move because it's adjacent to (3,6) which shows '1' and has no adjacent flags, indicating that (3,7) is likely safe.\n\n**MOVE:** 3,7,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 2 2 1\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 3 . .\n5 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n6 _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ 1 . .\n7 1 1 _ 2 . 2 _ 1 . .\n8 . 1 _ 1 . 1 _ 1 . .\n9 . 1 _ 1 . 1 _ 1 . .", "sucess": false}
