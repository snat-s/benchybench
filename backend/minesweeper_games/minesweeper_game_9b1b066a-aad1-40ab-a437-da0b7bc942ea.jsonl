The adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,1), (1,1), and (1,2). Since (1,2) already shows '1', it's likely not a bomb. So the bomb must be either (0,1) or (1,1).\n\n2. At (1,2), the number '1' is revealed. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1). Since (0,2) shares these tiles, and based on point 1, the bomb must be in one of these positions.\n\n3. At (1,3), the number '2' is revealed. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,4), (1,4), and (2,4). Since (1,2) is '1' and likely has one bomb adjacent, (1,3) must have a bomb in one of these tiles.\n\n4. At (1,4), the number '3' is revealed. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (2,3), (2,4), and (2,5). This is a more complex situation, but we can focus on the simpler cases first.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most straightforward move is to flag (0,1) as it is a probable bomb location based on the '1' at (0,2).\n\nMOVE: 0,1,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . . . 1 _ _ _\n1 _ _ 1 2 3 2 1 _ _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 . . 2 _ _ 1 2 2 1 _\n5 . . 2 _ _ 1 . . 1 _\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 3 . 2 _\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _\n8 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . 2 1\n9 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .", "sucess": true}

This means there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (0,2).\n\n2. **Look for safe reveals:**\n   - At (0,2), the number '1' already has a flag at (0,1), so the adjacent unexplored tiles at (0,3) and (1,2) must be safe.\n   - At (1,6), the number '1' is adjacent to the unexplored tile at (1,7). Since there are no flags around it, (1,7) is likely safe.\n\n3. **Look for flag placements:**\n   - At (6,7), the number '3' is adjacent to three unexplored tiles: (5,7), (7,7), and (7,8). This suggests that all three of these tiles could be bombs, but we need more information.\n   - At (8,7), the number '2' is adjacent to two unexplored tiles: (7,7) and (9,7). This suggests that both of these tiles could be bombs, but we need to confirm.\n\n4. **Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs:**\n   - There are 9 flags remaining and 10 bombs, so we need to be cautious with flag placements.\n\n### Decision:\nThe safest move is to reveal a tile that is guaranteed to be safe based on the existing flags and numbers. The tile at (1,7) is adjacent to the number '1' at (1,6), and there are no flags around it, so it must be safe.\n\n### Move:\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (1,7) is safe because it is adjacent to the number '1' at (1,6) and there are no flags around it.\nMOVE: 1,7,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ F 1 . . . 1 _ _ _\n1 _ _ 1 2 3 2 1 _ _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 . . 2 _ _ 1 2 2 1 _\n5 . . 2 _ _ 1 . . 1 _\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 3 . 2 _\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _\n8 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . 2 1\n9 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 3, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "### Step 1: Check all revealed numbers against existing flags\n\nFirst, I'll look at each numbered tile and check how many adjacent flags are present to ensure there are no conflicts.\n\n- **Tile (0,2) = 1**: Adjacent cells include (0,1), which is already flagged. Since the number is 1, there cannot be any other bombs adjacent to it. Therefore, the cells (0,3), (1,1), and (1,2) are safe to reveal.\n  \n- **Tile (1,3) = 2**: Adjacent cells include (0,2), which has a value of 1 and is not flagged. This tile may have bombs in (0,3) or (1,4). However, since we need to verify the number of adjacent flags, we need more information.\n\n- **Tile (1,4) = 3**: This tile has three adjacent bombs. We need to check if the adjacent cells' flags add up to this number.\n\nContinuing this process for all numbered tiles helps identify any discrepancies or confirmations needed.\n\n### Step 2: Look for obvious conflicts\n\nAn obvious conflict would be a numbered tile that has more adjacent flags than its number indicates. For example, a tile showing '1' with two adjacent flags is a conflict.\n\nIn this board:\n\n- **Tile (0,2) = 1**: Only one adjacent flag at (0,1). No conflict here.\n\n- **Tile (1,3) = 2**: Let's check adjacent cells for flags. If there's one flag, then another bomb must be adjacent.\n\n- **Tile (1,4) = 3**: Similarly, ensure that the sum of adjacent flags equals three.\n\nNo immediate conflicts are visible, so we proceed to the next step.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs. bombs\n\nThe game information states:\n\n- **Flags remaining**: 9\n- **Bombs**: 10\n\nThis means there are 10 bombs to be flagged, and we have 9 flags left. We need to strategically place flags to mark all bombs without running out of flags.\n\n### Step 4: Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile\n\nBased on the analysis, let's identify safe moves:\n\n- **Tile (0,3)**: Adjacent to tile (0,2) = 1, which already has one adjacent flag at (0,1). Therefore, (0,3) is safe to reveal.\n\n```\nEXPLANATION: Tile (0,2) shows '1' and already has an adjacent flag at (0,1).
