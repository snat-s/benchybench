The '1' at (0,0) means there is a bomb at (0,1) or (1,0) or (1,1). Since there is a '1' at (0,1) and (1,1) this suggests it is a bomb at either of these locations. Because of the '1' at (2,0) these are possibilities. The '1' at (3,7) could have bombs at (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,6), (3,8), or (3,9) or (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). The number of flags is 9, and there are 10 bombs, so there must be a bomb somewhere that is not flagged, to leave us with one additional bomb that is not flagged.
