{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 0, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nLet me first understand the current state of the Minesweeper board.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with 10 bombs total, and 10 flags remaining. This means no flags have been placed yet.\n\nLet me analyze the board state to find safe moves or places where I need to put flags.\n\nFirst, I'll look for obvious places to put flags:\n\n1. At (9,0) there's an unexplored space adjacent to a '1' at (8,0). Since the '1' indicates exactly one adjacent bomb and this is the only unexplored space next to it, there must be a bomb there.\n\n2. At (9,1) there's another unexplored space adjacent to numbers. It's next to the '2' at (8,1). Since the '2' is also adjacent to the unexplored space at (9,0) which we identified as a bomb, and it needs exactly 2 adjacent bombs, the space at (9,1) must also contain a bomb.\n\n3. At (9,2) there's an unexplored space adjacent to a '1' at (8,2). However, we need to check if this '1' is also adjacent to any other unexplored spaces that might contain bombs. It's also adjacent to (9,1), which we identified as a bomb. Since the '1' can only have one adjacent bomb, and we've already identified (9,1) as a bomb, (9,2) must be safe.\n\nLet me continue looking for obvious bombs:\n\n4. At (0,9) and (0,8), these are unexplored spaces adjacent to the '1' at (0,7). Since the '1' indicates exactly one adjacent bomb, one of these two spaces must contain a bomb, but we can't determine which one yet.\n\n5. At (6,9), there's an unexplored space adjacent to the '2' at (6,8) and the '1' at (7,9). Looking at (6,8), it's also adjacent to (7,8) which is unexplored. So there are two unexplored spaces adjacent to the '2', and without more information, we can't determine which ones have bombs.\n\nLet me look for safe squares to reveal:\n\n6. At (9,2), as mentioned earlier, this is safe to reveal because the adjacent '1' at (8,2) is already satisfied by the bomb at (9,1).\n\n7. Let's look at the '1' at (3,5). It needs exactly one adjacent bomb. It's adjacent to unexplored spaces at (2,5) and (3,6). Without more information, we can't determine which one has the bomb.\n\n8. Let's check (7,7). It's adjacent to the '2' at (7,8). The '2' needs exactly two adjacent bombs. (7,7) is adjacent to this '2', but so are (6,8) and (6,9). Without more information, we can't determine if (7,7) has a bomb.\n\nLet me try to find patterns or constraints by analyzing more thoroughly:\n\n9. The '2' at (7,6) is adjacent to three unexplored spaces: (6,5), (6,6), and (6,7). Without more information, we can't determine which two of these have bombs.\n\n10. The '1' at (6,6) is adjacent to three unexplored spaces: (5,5), (5,6), and (5,7). Without more information, we can't determine which one has a bomb.\n\n11. The '1' at (2,4) is adjacent to three unexplored spaces: (1,5), (2,5), and (3,5). Without more information, we can't determine which one has a bomb.\n\nLet me check for more complex constraints:\n\n12. Let's look at (1,5). It's adjacent to the '3' at (1,4), the '2' at (1,6), and it's also related to the constraint from the '1' at (2,4). This might give us more information.\n\n13. The '3' at (1,4) is adjacent to (0,5), (1,5), and (2,5). It needs exactly three bombs. Without more information, we can't determine if all three of these spaces have bombs or if some are safe.\n\nLet me look for one more potential safe move or bomb:\n\n14. The '1' at (0,2) is adjacent to unexplored spaces at (0,0) and (0,1). Without more information, we can't determine which one has a bomb.\n\nBased on this analysis, I've identified a few certain moves:\n\nBombs:\n- (9,0): This is adjacent to a '1' at (8,0) and is the only unexplored space adjacent to it, so it must be a bomb.\n- (9,1): This is adjacent to a '2' at (8,1). Since we've identified (9,0) as a bomb, and the '2' needs exactly two adjacent bombs, (9,1) must also be a bomb.\n\nSafe squares:\n- (9,2): This is adjacent to a '1' at (8,2). Since the '1' can only have one adjacent bomb, and we've identified (9,1) as a bomb, (9,2) must be safe.\n\nI'll choose to flag the bomb at (9,0) for my move.\n\nWait, let me double-check the flags remaining and the bombs count. We have 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining. This means no flags have been placed yet.\n\nLet me check if there are any other bombs I can identify with certainty:\n\n15. Let's check (6,9). It's adjacent to the '2' at (6,8) and the '1' at (7,9). The '2' needs exactly two bombs adjacent to it. It's adjacent to (7,7) and (7,8), which are both unexplored. Without more information, we can't determine which ones have bombs.\n\nLet me make sure I haven't missed anything obvious:\n\n16. Analyzing area around (0,9) and (0,8) again. These are adjacent to the '1' at (0,7). Since the '1' needs exactly one adjacent bomb, one of these two must be a bomb, but we can't determine which one.\n\n17. Looking at (6,9) and (7,8). These are adjacent to the '2' at (7,6). The '2' needs exactly two adjacent bombs. Without more information, we can't determine which ones have bombs.\n\nSo, I'm sticking with my decision to flag (9,0) as it's definitely a bomb.\n\nLet me check if there are other moves we could make:\n\nActually, let me check one thing with the \".\" squares. Are these unexplored? Yes, they are unexplored spaces according to the legend.\n\nSo let's recheck the situation at (9,0), (9,1), and (9,2):\n\n- (9,0) is adjacent to a '1' at (8,0). Since the '1' indicates exactly one adjacent bomb and this is the only unexplored space next to it, there must be a bomb at (9,0).\n- (9,1) is adjacent to a '2' at (8,1). The '2' is also adjacent to (9,0), which we've identified as a bomb. Since the '2' needs exactly two adjacent bombs, and it's only adjacent to these two unexplored spaces, (9,1) must also be a bomb.\n- (9,2) is adjacent to a '1' at (8,2). The '1' is also adjacent to (9,1), which we've identified as a bomb. Since the '1' can only have one adjacent bomb, and we've already identified (9,1) as a bomb, (9,2) must be safe.\n\nSo I'm still going to flag (9,0) as my move.\n\nWait, let me check one more thing. What's at (9,3)? It's a '1', so it's already revealed. And what's at (8,3)? It's a '1' as well, so it's also revealed. \n\nLet me look at the bottom-right corner of the board more carefully. The '2' at (6,8) is adjacent to three unexplored spaces: (6,9), (7,7), and (7,8). Without more information, we can't determine which two of these have bombs.\n\nActually, I realized I need to be more careful with the coordinates. In the given system, x represents the ROW and y represents the COLUMN. \n\nLet me reanalyze:\n\n1. At (0,0) and (0,1), these are unexplored spaces adjacent to the '1' at (0,2). Without more information, we can't determine which one has a bomb.\n\n2. At (9,0), (9,1), and (9,2), these are unexplored spaces adjacent to the '1' at (8,0), the '2' at (8,1), and the '1' at (8,2), respectively. Let's see if we can determine which ones have bombs:\n   - The '1' at (8,0) is adjacent to (9,0). Since the '1' indicates exactly one adjacent bomb and this is the only unexplored space next to it, there must be a bomb at (9,0).\n   - The '2' at (8,1) is adjacent to (9,0), (9,1), and (8,0). Since (8,0) is revealed and the '2' needs exactly two adjacent bombs, and we've identified (9,0) as a bomb, (9,1) must also be a bomb.\n   - The '1' at (8,2) is adjacent to (9,1) and (9,2). Since the '1' can only have one adjacent bomb, and we've already identified (9,1) as a bomb, (9,2) must be safe.\n\nSo, I'll flag (9,0) as my move.\n\nActually, let me go ahead and decide on a different move. Flagging (9,0) as explained before.\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the board carefully, I can identify some definite bombs and safe squares by analyzing the number constraints.\n\n## Definite Bomb Identification\nAt position (9,0), there's an unexplored space adjacent to the '1' at (8,0). Since this '1' indicates exactly one adjacent bomb and this is the only unexplored space next to it, there must be a bomb at (9,0).\n\nSimilarly, at position (9,1), we have an unexplored space adjacent to the '2' at (8,1). The '2' at (8,1) is also adjacent to the unexplored space at (9,0) which we just identified as a bomb. Since the '2' needs exactly two adjacent bombs, and it only has these two unexplored neighbors, position (9,1) must also contain a bomb.\n\nI'll start by flagging the first definite bomb I identified.\n\nEXPLANATION: The '1' at (8,0) has only one unexplored adjacent square at (9,0), so that square must contain a bomb.\nMOVE: 9,0,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . . . . 1 _ _\n1 _ _ 1 2 3 . 2 1 _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ 1 1 1 1 . 1 _ _ _\n4 _ 1 . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 1\n6 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n8 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n9 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}

The 2 at (7,8) is also touching (6,9) and (7,9). Since the 1 at (7,6) can only have one bomb adjacent to it, and it's adjacent to (7,7), this means if (7,7) is a bomb, there can't be any other bombs adjacent to (7,6). \n\nNow let's look at the 2 at (7,8) - it needs exactly 2 bombs adjacent. It's adjacent to (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,7), (7,9), (8,7), (8,8), and (8,9). Of these, (6,7), (6,8), (8,7), and (8,8) are already revealed, so they can't be bombs. This leaves (6,9), (7,7), (7,9), and (8,9) as possible bomb locations.\n\nThe 1 at (7,9) is adjacent to (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), and (8,9). Of these, (6,8) and (7,8) are already revealed, so they can't contain bombs. This means that exactly one of (6,9) and (8,9) must be a bomb.\n\nActually, let me be more systematic. Let me look at all revealed numbers and see if there are any obvious deductions:\n\n1. Looking at position (7,8) - the value is 2, and it has 4 unexplored adjacent cells: (6,9), (7,7), (7,9), and (8,9). So 2 of these 4 must be bombs.\n\n2. Position (7,9) - the value is 1, and it has 2 unexplored adjacent cells: (6,9) and (8,9). So 1 of these 2 must be a bomb.\n\n3. Position (7,6) - the value is 1, and it has 1 unexplored adjacent cell: (7,7). So (7,7) must be a bomb!\n\nThis is a clear conclusion - (7,7) must be a bomb because the 1 at (7,6) has only one unexplored adjacent cell.\n\nSo I should flag (7,7).\n\nBut let me double-check my reasoning and also explore other parts of the board:\n\nLet me look at the bottom left corner again:\n- The 1 at (8,0) has no unexplored adjacent cells.\n- The 2 at (8,1) is adjacent to 2 unexplored cells: (9,0) and (9,1).\n- The 1 at (9,3) is adjacent to 2 unexplored cells: (9,2) and (8,3).\n\nSince (9,0) is already flagged and the 2 at (8,1) needs exactly 2 bombs, (9,1) must be a bomb.\n\nAlso, let's examine the center of the board:\n- The 1 at (4,1) has an unexplored cell at (4,2).\n- The 1 at (4,3) has no unexplored adjacent cells.\n\nLet me also check the top right area:\n- The 1 at (0,7) has unexplored adjacent cells at (0,8) and (0,9).\n- The 1 at (1,7) has unexplored adjacent cells at (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), and (1,9).\n\nI can't make definitive conclusions about this area yet.\n\nOk, I've identified two clear moves:\n1. Flag (7,7) - definitely a bomb based on the 1 at (7,6)\n2. Flag (9,1) - definitely a bomb based on the 2 at (8,1) and existing flag at (9,0)\n\nLet me go with the first one - flagging position (7,7).\n\nActually, I should make sure to carefully recheck my reasoning for (7,7) one more time:\n\nPosition (7,6) has a 1, meaning exactly one adjacent cell contains a bomb. Its adjacent cells are:\n- (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)\n\nOf these, (6,6), (6,7), (8,6), and (8,7) are revealed, so they can't be bombs.\nThis leaves (6,5), (7,5), (7,7), and (8,5) as potential bomb locations.\n\nWait, I made a mistake in my analysis. The 1 at (7,6) has multiple unexplored adjacent cells, not just (7,7). So I can't definitively say that (7,7) is a bomb based solely on this.\n\nLet me reconsider my analysis and look more carefully.\n\nLooking at (9,1):\n- There's a 2 at (8,1)\n- It's adjacent to a flag at (9,0)\n- The only other unexplored adjacent cell is (9,1)\n- Therefore, (9,1) must be a bomb\n\nThis is a clear conclusion, so I'll flag (9,1).\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the current board, I need to find definite safe moves or bombs to flag.\n\n## Key Observations:\n1. Near the bottom left:\n   - Position (8,1) shows a '2'\n   - One adjacent bomb is already flagged at (9,0)\n   - The only other unexplored cell adjacent to this '2' is at (9,1)\n   - Therefore, (9,1) must also be a bomb to satisfy the '2'\n\n2. Additionally, I see other areas that need analysis (like positions around (7,7) and (6,9)), but the (9,1) position is a definite bomb based on the constraint from the '2' at (8,1).\n\nSince we have 9 flags remaining and know that there are exactly 10 bombs total (with 1 already flagged), I can confidently place a flag at (9,1).\n\nEXPLANATION: Position (9,1) must be a bomb because the '2' at (8,1) has one adjacent flag at (9,0) and needs exactly one more bomb, which can only be at (9,1).\nMOVE: 9,1,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . . . . 1 _ _\n1 _ _ 1 2 3 . 2 1 _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ 1 1 1 1 . 1 _ _ _\n4 _ 1 . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 1\n6 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n8 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n9 F . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 2, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nLet's analyze the board carefully to determine the next move.\n\nFirst, let's check for any revealed numbers against existing flags and look for obvious safe moves or obvious places to flag.\n\nStarting with a general survey of the board:\n- We have 10 bombs total\n- We have 8 flags remaining\n- 2 bombs are already flagged at (9,0) and (9,1)\n\nLet's start by examining the areas where we have revealed numbers that might give us clear information:\n\nIn the bottom-left area, we have a revealed '1' at (8,0) with a '2' to its right at (8,1), and '1's at (8,2) and (8,3). The two flags at (9,0) and (9,1) satisfy the '1' at (8,0) and partially satisfy the '2' at (8,1). Since the '2' at (8,1) already has 2 adjacent bombs (the flagged ones), the remaining unexplored tile at (9,2) must be safe, so we can reveal it.\n\nIn the bottom-right area, we see a '2' at (6,8) with a '2' to its right at (6,9), and below that a '2' at (7,8) and '1' at (7,9). There's an unexplored space at (7,7) that's adjacent to the '1' at (7,6). Since the '1' at (7,6) indicates only one adjacent bomb, and there are no flags around it yet, the bomb could be at (7,7) or somewhere else adjacent to the '1'. We don't have enough information yet.\n\nIn the middle-right area, there's a '1' at (2,6) with an unexplored space above it at (1,6). We know there's a '2' at (1,6) and a '1' at (0,7), so we need to be careful about this area.\n\nLet's look at the middle section more carefully:\n- At (5,8) and (5,9), we have '1's. The unexplored space at (6,9) must be considered.\n- The '1' at (3,6) has unexplored spaces around it, including at (2,6) and potentially others.\n\nLet's examine the top-right section:\n- We have a '1' at (0,7) with an unexplored space at (0,8) and (0,9).\n- The '1' at (1,7) with adjacent unexplored spaces.\n\nLet me go square by square and check constraints:\n\nAt (9,2), the '1' at (8,2) indicates one bomb adjacent. Since it's adjacent to the unexplored (9,2), (9,3), and potentially (9,1), and we know (9,1) is flagged, there could still be a bomb at (9,2) or (9,3).\n\nAt (6,9), we have the '2' at (6,8) adjacent to it, and the '2' says there are 2 bombs nearby. Since there are no flags in this area yet, we don't know if (6,9) is safe or not.\n\nLet me check some specific areas more carefully:\n\nBottom-left area:\n- We have a '1' at (8,2) with unexplored spaces at (9,2) and (9,3).\n- The '1' at (8,3) is adjacent to the unexplored space at (9,3) and (9,4).\n- Both (9,2) and (9,3) are adjacent to numbers, so we might get information from analyzing them.\n\nFor (9,2):\n- Adjacent to the '1' at (8,2).\n- Also potentially adjacent to the flagged (9,1), though I'm not 100% sure of the adjacency rules (diagonal counts, I believe).\n- If diagonal adjacency counts and (9,1) is flagged, then the '1' at (8,2) indicates there can't be another bomb adjacent, so (9,2) should be safe.\n\nMiddle-right area:\n- The '1' at (2,6) is adjacent to unexplored spaces.\n- The '1' at (3,6) has some unexplored spaces around it.\n\nTop-right area:\n- The '1' at (0,7) is adjacent to unexplored spaces at (0,8) and (0,9).\n\nI need to be very careful with my analysis to avoid making a mistake. Let me re-examine the board and check some specific coordinates for clarity:\n\nLet's check (8,2). It's adjacent to the unexplored (9,2), and it's showing a '1'. If (9,1) is a bomb (which it's flagged as), and if (8,2) is adjacent to (9,1) (diagonally), then that would satisfy the '1' at (8,2), meaning (9,2) is safe. Let me check this adjacency again:\n\n(8,2) is adjacent to: \n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3) (above)\n- (8,1), (8,3) (sides)\n- (9,1), (9,2), (9,3) (below)\n\nSo yes, (8,2) is adjacent to (9,1), which is flagged as a bomb. Since (8,2) shows a '1', and there's already a bomb at (9,1), the other adjacent unexplored tiles (9,2) and (9,3) must be safe. We can reveal (9,2).\n\nActually, let me check this more carefully. The '1' at (8,2) means there is exactly one bomb adjacent to it. We have a flag at (9,1), which is diagonally adjacent to (8,2). So if that flag is correct, there can't be another bomb adjacent to (8,2), which means (9,2) should be safe to reveal.\n\nLet's now check (9,3). It's adjacent to the '1' at (8,3). The '1' indicates exactly one bomb adjacent, but we don't have any flags around (8,3) yet, so we don't know if (9,3) is safe or not.\n\nLet me check the top-right corner more carefully:\n- The '1' at (0,7) indicates one bomb adjacent, which could be at (0,8) or (0,9) or elsewhere.\n- The '1' at (1,7) has several unexplored spaces around it.\n\nActually, let's check (1,6). It shows a '2', meaning there are exactly 2 bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent tiles are:\n- (0,5), (0,6), (0,7) (above)\n- (1,5), (1,7) (sides)\n- (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) (below)\n\nOf these, (0,7), (1,7), and (2,6) are revealed and show '1', '1', and '1' respectively. (1,5) is marked with a number (not visible or '.'), and (2,5) is marked with '.'. (0,5), (0,6), and (2,7) are also unexplored.\n\nGiven that (1,6) shows a '2', and there are several unexplored spaces around it, we don't have enough information to determine a safe move in this area yet.\n\nLet me check (6,9):\n- Adjacent to the '2' at (6,8).\n- Also adjacent to the '2' at (7,8) and the '1' at (7,9).\n\nThe '2' at (6,8) indicates two bombs adjacent, and the '2' at (7,8) also indicates two bombs adjacent. Since there are no flags in this area yet, we don't know if (6,9) is safe or not.\n\nLet me check (9,2) again:\n- Adjacent to the '1' at (8,2).\n- The '1' at (8,2) is also adjacent to the flagged (9,1).\n- Since the '1' at (8,2) indicates exactly one bomb adjacent, and there's already a flag at (9,1), (9,2) should be safe to reveal.\n\nI think revealing (9,2) is a safe move.\n\nLet me double-check one more time:\n- We have a '1' at (8,2).\n- It's adjacent to the unexplored (9,2) and the flagged (9,1).\n- Since the '1' indicates exactly one bomb adjacent, and there's already a flag at (9,1), (9,2) must be safe.\n\nSo my next move is to reveal (9,2).\n\nWait, let me check another area one more time to make sure I'm not missing something obvious. Let's check the top-right corner:\n\n- We have a '1' at (0,7) with unexplored spaces at (0,8) and (0,9).\n- The '1' at (1,7) has unexplored spaces around it.\n\nI don't see a clear safe move in this area either.\n\nLet's check one more area, the middle-right section:\n- The '1' at (3,6) has some unexplored spaces around it.\n- The '1' at (2,6) also has unexplored spaces.\n\nAgain, no clear safe move here.\n\nAlright, I'm fairly confident that revealing (9,2) is a safe move. Let's proceed with that.\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the board carefully, I need to find a safe move based on the revealed numbers and existing flags.\n\n## Analysis of Key Areas\n\n### Bottom-Left Corner:\n- At (8,2) we have a '1', which means exactly one bomb in the adjacent tiles\n- This '1' is adjacent to the flagged bomb at (9,1) (diagonally)\n- Since exactly one bomb is adjacent to (8,2) and we've already identified it with a flag at (9,1), the other adjacent unexplored tile at (9,2) must be safe\n\n### Other Areas:\n- I've checked other regions of the board but don't see any other guaranteed safe moves\n- The bottom-right section has some interesting number patterns around (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), and (7,9), but without additional revealed squares, I can't make a definite conclusion\n- Similarly, the top-right area has some unexplored spaces adjacent to the '1' at (0,7), but I don't have enough information to determine safety\n\nBased on the constraint that the '1' at (8,2) can only have exactly one adjacent bomb, and we've already flagged it at (9,1), it's safe to reveal the tile at (9,2).\n\nEXPLANATION: The '1' at (8,2) is already satisfied by the flag at (9,1), so (9,2) must be safe.\nMOVE: 9,2,false", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . . . . 1 _ _\n1 _ _ 1 2 3 . 2 1 _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ 1 1 1 1 . 1 _ _ _\n4 _ 1 . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _\n5 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 1\n6 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n8 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n9 F F . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": false}
