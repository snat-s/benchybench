So the second adjacent bomb must go near.\n\n2. **Check the conflict regarding flagged squares:**\n   - The flag at (4, 5) does not cause any conflict since (3, 5) still meets requirements with potential bombs at (5, 5) and one other that is yet to be determined.\n   - However, moving to (5, 4) is also supported by the '2' from (5, 5).\n\n3. **Determine remaining flags and potential next moves:**\n   - Since we have 9 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total, we can afford to explore safely.\n   - Following all rules with revealed numbers, it becomes clear that placing a flag at (5, 4) is necessary because it is adjacent to (5, 5) and will satisfy the nearby counts.\n\nGiven the analysis, the ideal move is to flag position (5, 4) because this is where we suspect a bomb lies according to the numerical counts.\n\nEXPLANATION: I am placing a flag at (5, 4) as it is adjacent to number 2 in (5, 5) and it helps ensure the numerical conditions are met.\nMOVE: 5,4,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ 2 . . . . .\n4 _ _ _ _ F . . . . .\n5 _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . . .\n6 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 1 1\n7 . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n8 . . . . 2 1 1 1 1 1\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
