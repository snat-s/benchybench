{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 1, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "### Understanding the Current Board State\n\nFirst, let's interpret the provided board state:\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 F . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n\n- **Row 0** has two `1`s at columns 0 and 1, indicating that each of these squares has exactly one bomb in their adjacent squares. The rest of the squares in this row are unexplored (`.`).\n  \n- **Row 1** has a flagged square `F` at column 0. The rest are unexplored.\n\n- **Rows 2 through 9** are entirely unexplored.\n\n### Analyzing the Revealed Numbers and Flags\n\nLet's focus on the numbered squares to understand where the bombs are likely located.\n\n#### Square (0,0) with value `1`\n\nThis square indicates that there is exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares to (0,0) are:\n\n- (0,1)\n- (1,0)\n- (1,1)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (0,1) has a value of `1`, which we'll analyze next.\n  \n- (1,0) is flagged (`F`), meaning there's a bomb there.\n\nGiven that (1,0) is flagged as a bomb, and (0,0) requires exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares, we can deduce that the other adjacent squares\u2014(0,1) and (1,1)\u2014are safe and do not contain bombs.\n\n#### Square (0,1) with value `1`\n\nThis square also indicates exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares to (0,1) are:\n\n- (0,0)\n- (0,2)\n- (1,0)\n- (1,1)\n- (1,2)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (0,0) has a value of `1`, which we've already analyzed.\n  \n- (1,0) is flagged as a bomb.\n\nSince (1,0) is a bomb, and (0,1) needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares, the other adjacent squares\u2014(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), and (1,2)\u2014are safe and do not contain bombs.\n\n### Identifying Safe Squares to Reveal\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can identify safe squares that do not contain bombs:\n\n- **Square (1,1)**: Adjacent to both (0,0) and (0,1), both of which already have their bomb counts satisfied by the flagged square (1,0). Therefore, (1,1) is safe to reveal.\n\n- **Square (0,2)**: Adjacent only to (0,1), which has its bomb count satisfied by (1,0). Therefore, (0,2) is safe to reveal.\n\nHowever, since (0,2) is unexplored and we've deduced it's safe, revealing it can provide more information for further moves.\n\n### Deciding the Next Move\n\nGiven the analysis, revealing square (1,1) would be a logical next step because:\n\n- It's adjacent to two numbered squares, both of which have their bomb counts satisfied by the existing flag at (1,0).\n  \n- Revealing (1,1) can provide more information about the surrounding squares, aiding in the identification of additional safe squares or bombs.\n\n### Potential Confirmation\n\nBefore finalizing the move, let's confirm that placing a flag or revealing another square doesn't conflict with the existing information.\n\n- **Square (1,1)**: As established, it's safe to reveal.\n  \n- **Square (0,2)**: Also safe to reveal, but since (1,1) is adjacent to more numbered squares, revealing it first might provide more information.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the numbered squares and the existing flag, it's clear that revealing square (1,1) is a safe and strategic move that can lead to further progress in the game.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n---\n\n**EXPLANATION:**  \nSquare (1,1) is adjacent to two numbered squares, (0,0) and (0,1), both of which have their bomb counts satisfied by the flagged square at (1,0). Therefore, (1,1) is safe to reveal and will provide more information about the surrounding squares.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,1,false\n\n---\n\nThis move ensures that we avoid any potential bombs and make progress in uncovering the safe areas of the board.", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 F . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
