{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs, and I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after making this move, the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '3'. That means there are 3 bombs adjacent to this cell. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nSince it's my first move and I have no other information, I should flag the cells that are likely to be bombs based on this number. But I need to be careful not to overflag or underflag.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total, I need to use them wisely. Each flag I place should be as accurate as possible.\n\nLet's say I decide to flag three cells adjacent to the '3'. But which three? I need to look at the board and see if any of these adjacent cells are already revealed or have numbers that can give me more information.\n\nAssuming that no other cells are revealed yet, I can choose to flag any three of the eight adjacent cells. For now, I'll choose to flag (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5).\n\nSo, my next moves would be:\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\n\nMOVE: 3,4,true\n\nMOVE: 4,3,true\n\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged three cells, and I have 7 flags left. Next, I should reveal another cell that is not adjacent to the initial reveal to try to expand the board further.\n\nLet's choose (6,6) as another safe starting point.\n\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\n\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\nSuppose this reveals a '1'. Now, there is only one bomb adjacent to (6,6). The adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nI need to see if any of these are already flagged or revealed. Assuming none are flagged yet, I'll flag one of them, say (6,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\n\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged four cells, and I have 6 flags left.\n\nContinuing this process, I need to look for more numbers and adjust my flags accordingly. If I reveal a cell and it shows a '0', that means there are no bombs adjacent to it, and the game should automatically reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nLet's say I reveal (5,4) and it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nI already have flags on (4,3), (4,5), and (6,5). So, out of the eight adjacent cells to (5,4), three are flagged. The number '2' means only two of them are bombs. This suggests that one of the flagged cells is not a bomb, which is a conflict.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If '2' means exactly two adjacent bombs, and I have three flags on adjacent cells, then one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. Therefore, I need to remove one flag from the adjacent cells of (5,4).\n\nSo, I need to unflag one of the cells: (4,3), (4,5), or (6,5). But I need to choose wisely.\n\nLooking at the board, if I unflag (6,5), and assuming that (6,5) is not a bomb, then the '1' at (6,6) would still need one flag, so maybe (6,7) should be flagged.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (3,3). Suppose it shows a '1'. Adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nI have a flag on (3,4) and (4,3). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (3,3). But the '1' indicates only one adjacent bomb. Therefore, one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. So, I need to unflag one of them.\n\nThis suggests that either (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb. But earlier, based on the '3' at (4,4), I flagged (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5). Now, if one of (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb, then perhaps (4,5) is the actual bomb.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (5,5). Suppose it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nI have flags on (4,5) and (6,5). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (5,5). The '2' means exactly two bombs adjacent, so the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (4,6), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,6) safely.\n\nLet's reveal (4,6). Suppose it shows a '0'. Then, the game should auto-reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nNow, the board has expanded in that area, giving me more information.\n\nContinuing this process, revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers, I can progress through the game.\n\nIt's important to keep track of the number of flags left and the number of potential bombs still to be flagged.\n\nAlso, sometimes, I might need to make educated guesses when there isn't enough information to be certain, but that can be risky.\n\nIn summary, my strategy is to:\n\n1. Make initial safe moves to start revealing the board.\n\n2. Flag cells based on the numbers revealed, ensuring that the number of flags matches the numbers.\n\n3. Reveal cells that are likely safe based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\n4. Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n5. Continue this process until all bombs are flagged or all safe cells are revealed.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this Minesweeper problem, we need to methodically reveal safe cells and flag bombs based on the numbers revealed, which indicate how many bombs are adjacent to each cell. Here is a step-by-step approach to playing the game:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - The first move is safe, so choose a central cell to maximize the area revealed.\n   - Based on the number revealed, flag the appropriate number of adjacent cells as bombs.\n\n2. **Expand the Board**:\n   - Choose another safe cell away from the initial move to further expand the revealed area.\n   - Continue flagging cells based on the numbers revealed.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If a number indicates fewer bombs than the flags placed, remove flags accordingly.\n   - Ensure that the number of flags around each numbered cell matches the number shown.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n6. **Completion**:\n   - The game is won by either revealing all safe cells or correctly flagging all bombs.\n\n### Solution Code Structure\n\nSince Minesweeper is an interactive problem, the solution involves a series of moves based on the board's state, which is updated after each move. Therefore, the solution is presented as a sequence of moves with explanations.\n\n### Example Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\n# Move 1: Initial safe move at center\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '3'\n# Flag three adjacent cells\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\nMOVE: 3,4,true\nMOVE: 4,3,true\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\n# Move 2: Another safe move away from initial reveal\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '1'\n# Flag one adjacent cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\n# Move 3: Reveal a new cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another cell to get more information.\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '2'\n# Adjust flags based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Adjust flags around '2' at (5,4).\n# If conflict, unflag one cell\nMOVE: 4,5,false  # Unflag if necessary\n\n# Move 4: Reveal a safe cell based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a safe cell adjacent to '2'.\nMOVE: 4,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '0'\n# Auto-reveal neighbors\nEXPLANATION: '0' at (4,6), auto-revealing neighbors.\n\n# Continue this process until the game is solved.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - Start with a safe move at the center to maximize reveal.\n   - Flag adjacent cells based on the number revealed.\n\n2. **Expanding the Board**:\n   - Make another safe move away from the initial reveal to get more information.\n   - Flag cells accordingly based on new revelations.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If flags exceed the number indicated, remove flags from likely safe cells.\n   - Ensure consistency between flags and numbers.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust strategy as new information is revealed to avoid conflicts and progress towards solving the board.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 3, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left to find. I've got 10 flags remaining, which matches the number of bombs left.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the numbers and see where the bombs might be. Let's start from the top left since that's where the coordinates begin.\n\nLooking at row 0 and row 1, they're mostly empty or have numbers. Row 2 has some dots, which are unexplored spaces.\n\nLet me focus on row 2, column 2. It's a '1'. Adjacent to it are positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3).\n\nCurrently, none of these are flagged or showing bombs. So, one of these eight positions has a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, position (2,4) is a '1', so adjacent to that are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5).\n\nWait a minute, position (1,3) is adjacent to both '1's. So, if there's a bomb there, it would satisfy both '1's.\n\nBut let's see, if I assume there's a bomb at (1,3), then the '1' at (2,2) would have its bomb at (1,3), and the '1' at (2,4) would also have its bomb at (1,3). That seems possible.\n\nBut I need to check if that's the only possibility.\n\nLooking at position (3,2), it's a '2'. Adjacent to it are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3).\n\nIf there are two bombs adjacent to (3,2), and considering that (1,3) might be one of them, but (1,3) is not adjacent to (3,2). Wait, (1,3) is not adjacent to (3,2); it's two rows up and one column over.\n\nSo, for (3,2), which is a '2', I need to find two bombs among its adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at its adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,1): unexplored\n\n- (2,2): '1'\n\n- (2,3): unexplored\n\n- (3,1): unexplored\n\n- (3,3): unexplored\n\n- (4,1): unexplored\n\n- (4,2): '2'\n\n- (4,3): unexplored\n\nSo, among these, (2,2) is a '1', which we already considered.\n\nWait, actually, (2,2) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (3,2), which is a '2'. So, if there's a bomb adjacent to (2,2), it would satisfy its '1', and also contribute to the '2' of (3,2).\n\nBut, for (3,2) to have two bombs adjacent, and one of them is adjacent to (2,2), which is a '1', then the other bomb must be somewhere else in (3,2)'s adjacent squares.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet's look at row 4, column 4. It's a '3', which is adjacent to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5).\n\nSince it's a '3', there are three bombs adjacent to it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is a '2', adjacent to (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3).\n\nSo, for (4,2), which is a '2', there are two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nAnd (5,6) is a '1', adjacent to (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), and (6,7).\n\nWait, position (4,6) is a '1', and (5,6) is a '1'. Let's see their adjacent squares.\n\nPosition (4,6): '1', adjacent to (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), and (6,5), (6,6).\n\nWait, (6,6) is not adjacent to (4,6), it's two rows down.\n\nAnyway, position (4,6) is '1', and position (5,6) is '1'.\n\nLet's see if there's any overlap in their adjacent squares.\n\nPosition (4,6): adjacent squares are (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7).\n\nPosition (5,6): adjacent squares are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nSo, there is some overlap in their adjacent squares.\n\nBut this seems too complicated for now. Maybe I should look for a different area.\n\nLet me look at row 8, column 3. It's a '2', adjacent to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), and (9,4).\n\nPosition (8,4) is a '1', adjacent to (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), and (9,5).\n\nSo, for (8,4), which is a '1', there is one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nSimilarly, (8,3) is a '2', so two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nLooking at the adjacent squares, some overlap between (8,3) and (8,4).\n\nMaybe I can find a way to deduce where the bombs are here.\n\nLet's consider the squares adjacent to both (8,3) and (8,4):\n\n- (7,3), (7,4), (8,3), (8,4), (9,3), (9,4)\n\nSo, for (8,3), which is a '2', there are two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nFor (8,4), which is a '1', there is one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nIf I can find squares that are only adjacent to one of these numbers, it might help.\n\nLooking at (8,3)'s adjacent squares:\n\n- (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n\nSquares unique to (8,3):\n\n- (7,2), (8,2), (9,2)\n\nSquares adjacent to both:\n\n- (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (9,3), (9,4)\n\nSimilarly, for (8,4):\n\n- (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\nSquares unique to (8,4):\n\n- (7,5), (8,5), (9,5)\n\nSo, if I assume that the bombs are in the unique squares, but that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the bombs are in the overlapping squares.\n\nWait, this is getting too speculative.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me try to look for a square that must be safe to click.\n\nFor example, if I have a number with all but one adjacent squares flagged, then the remaining square must be safe.\n\nOr, if a number has the correct number of flags adjacent to it, then the remaining adjacent squares are safe.\n\nLooking at position (6,1), which is a '1', adjacent to (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), and (7,2).\n\nAssuming none of these are flagged, then one of these eight squares has a bomb.\n\nBut I don't know which one.\n\nWait, actually, I need to check if any of these are already flagged.\n\nLooking back at the board, I don't see any flags yet because flags are represented by 'F', and I don't see any 'F's on the board. So, no flags have been placed yet.\n\nTherefore, for (6,1), which is a '1', none of its adjacent squares are flagged, so one of them has a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, position (6,2) is a '2', adjacent to (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), and (7,3).\n\nTwo bombs are adjacent to it.\n\nPosition (6,7) is a '2', adjacent to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), and (7,8).\n\nTwo bombs are adjacent to it.\n\nPosition (7,0) is a '1', adjacent to (6,-1) [out of bounds], (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,-1) [out of bounds], (8,0), (8,1).\n\nSo, valid adjacent squares are (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1).\n\nIt's a '1', so one of these five squares has a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, position (7,1) is a '2', adjacent to (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), and (8,2).\n\nTwo bombs are adjacent to it.\n\nLooking at these, maybe I can find a way to deduce where a bomb must be.\n\nLooking at position (6,1), which is a '1', and position (7,1), which is a '2', their common adjacent squares are (6,0), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1).\n\nWait, (6,1) is part of (7,1)'s adjacent squares, but (6,1) is a number, so it's not a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (7,1) is a number, so it's not a bomb.\n\nSo, the possible bomb locations among the adjacent squares are (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), and (8,1).\n\nFor (6,1), which is a '1', one of its adjacent squares has a bomb.\n\nFor (7,1), which is a '2', two of its adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nSo, considering the overlapping adjacent squares, perhaps I can set up equations to solve for the bomb positions.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nLet:\n\n- A = (6,0)\n\n- B = (7,0)\n\n- C = (8,0)\n\n- D = (8,1)\n\nThen, for (6,1), which is a '1', A + B = 1, assuming that only A and B are the possible bomb locations adjacent to (6,1).\n\nWait, but (6,1) is adjacent to A, B, and possibly others.\n\nWait, let's list again the adjacent squares for (6,1):\n\n- (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1)\n\nBut (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (7,1) are not in the set {A, B, C, D}.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach isn't straightforward.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different section of the board.\n\nLet's look at row 5, column 6. It's a '1', adjacent to (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), and (6,7).\n\nSimilarly, (5,8) is a '1', adjacent to (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), and (6,9).\n\nThese two '1's share some adjacent squares, like (5,7) and (6,7).\n\nBut without any flags placed yet, it's hard to deduce exactly where the bombs are.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total number of flags left and see if there are any obvious places to place them.\n\nI have 10 flags left and 10 bombs remaining, so I need to place flags exactly where the bombs are.\n\nIf I can find a square that must be a bomb, I can place a flag there.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find a square that must be safe, I can reveal it.\n\nLooking back at the board, perhaps I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers and see if I can deduce its status.\n\nFor example, position (2,3) is a dot, adjacent to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), and (3,4).\n\n(1,2) is a '1', (1,3) is a '1', (1,4) is a '1', (2,2) is a '1', (2,4) is a '1', (3,2) is a '2', (3,3) is a dot, (3,4) is a dot.\n\nSo, multiple '1's around it.\n\nIf I can determine that some of these '1's have their bombs in specific locations, I might be able to deduce whether (2,3) is safe or a bomb.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nMaybe I should try to look for a square where the number of unflagged adjacent squares equals the number minus the flags already placed.\n\nFor example, if a '2' has one flag adjacent to it and one unexplored square, then the unexplored square must be a bomb.\n\nBut in my current board, I don't see any such squares yet.\n\nWait, let's check position (4,4), which is a '3', adjacent to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5).\n\nAssuming none are flagged yet, and some are unexplored, if I can find that only a certain set of squares can contain the three bombs, I might be able to place flags there.\n\nBut with no flags placed yet, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers and see if it's the only possible location for a bomb.\n\nFor example, if a square is the only unflagged adjacent square to a number that requires one more bomb, then it must be a bomb.\n\nBut again, with no flags placed yet, this is not applicable.\n\nPerhaps I need to take a risk and reveal a square, accepting that there's a chance it might be a bomb.\n\nBut I want to choose a square that has the lowest probability of being a bomb.\n\nLooking at the board, position (0,0) is unexplored, but it's adjacent to other unexplored squares, so it's risky.\n\nPosition (9,9) is also unexplored, but again, adjacent to other unexplored squares.\n\nWait, position (9,6) is a '1', adjacent to (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7), (10,5), but 10 is out of bounds, so (9,5), (9,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7).\n\nIf I look at (9,6), which is a '1', and see that none of its adjacent squares are flagged, then one of these squares has a bomb.\n\nBut I don't know which one.\n\nSimilarly, position (9,7) is a '1', adjacent to (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9,6), (9,8), (10,6), but 10 is out of bounds, so (9,6), (9,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8).\n\nSo, for (9,7), which is a '1', one of its adjacent squares has a bomb.\n\nLooking at the overlapping adjacent squares between (9,6) and (9,7), which are (8,6), (8,7), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8).\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the bombs are in these overlapping squares.\n\nBut again, it's not clear.\n\nMaybe I should consider that (9,5) is adjacent only to (9,6), so if (9,6) has one bomb adjacent, and (9,5) is the only unexplored square adjacent only to (9,6), then maybe it's safe.\n\nWait, position (9,5) is adjacent to (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,5), but 10 is out of bounds, so (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6).\n\nIf I consider that (9,6) has one bomb adjacent, and (9,5) is one of those adjacent squares, then perhaps I can consider the probability.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, and see if it's the only possible location for a bomb.\n\nFor example, if a square is the only unflagged square adjacent to a number that requires one more bomb, then it must be a bomb.\n\nBut again, with no flags placed yet, this doesn't apply.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is not adjacent to any numbers, meaning it's probably safe.\n\nBut in Minesweeper, sometimes safe squares are adjacent to numbered squares, so that might not be reliable.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, and see if the only way to satisfy all those numbers is for that square to be a bomb or safe.\n\nFor example, if a square is adjacent to two different '1's, and both '1's need a bomb adjacent to them, and this square is the only common unflagged square, then it must be a bomb.\n\nBut in my current board, I don't see such a configuration yet.\n\nMaybe I need to make an educated guess and place a flag where it seems most likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 3, which is a dot, adjacent to multiple '1's and a '2'.\n\nSimilarly, position (3,3) is a dot, adjacent to '2's and '1's.\n\nPerhaps I can try to place a flag on one of these dots and see if it satisfies the numbers.\n\nBut since I have to be careful not to place a flag where it would contradict the numbers, I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that if I place a flag on (2,3), which is adjacent to multiple '1's, it would satisfy some of those '1's.\n\nBut I need to make sure that placing a flag there doesn't contradict any other numbers.\n\nLet me try to simulate placing a flag on (2,3).\n\nIf I place a flag on (2,3), then it would satisfy the '1' at (2,2), because (2,2) is adjacent to (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, it would satisfy the '1' at (2,4), because (2,3) is adjacent to (2,4).\n\nAlso, it would satisfy the '2' at (3,2), because (2,3) is adjacent to (3,2).\n\nSo, placing a flag on (2,3) would help satisfy multiple numbers.\n\nBut I need to check if this is consistent with the other numbers around.\n\nLooking at (3,2), which is a '2', adjacent to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nIf I place a flag on (2,3), that's one bomb for (3,2)'s '2'.\n\nI need another bomb adjacent to (3,2).\n\nLooking at (4,2), which is a '2', adjacent to (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n\nIf I place a flag on (2,3), it satisfies one bomb for (3,2), but (4,2) needs two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nSo, perhaps there's another bomb adjacent to both (3,2) and (4,2).\n\nLooking at their common adjacent squares: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3).\n\nIf I place a flag on (3,1), that would satisfy another bomb for both (3,2) and (4,2).\n\nSo, placing flags on (2,3) and (3,1) would satisfy the '2's at (3,2) and (4,2), as well as the '1's at (2,2) and (2,4).\n\nBut I need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (4,2), which is a '2', adjacent to (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n\nIf I place flags on (2,3) and (3,1), that would account for two bombs adjacent to (4,2), which satisfies it.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2), which is a '2', would have flags on (2,3) and (3,1), satisfying it.\n\n(2,2), which is a '1', would have a flag on (2,3), satisfying it.\n\n(2,4), which is a '1', would have a flag on (2,3), satisfying it.\n\nSo, this seems consistent so far.\n\nNow, let's see if placing flags on (2,3) and (3,1) conflicts with any other numbers.\n\nLooking at (4,1), which is a dot, adjacent to (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2).\n\nIf I place a flag on (3,1), then for (4,1), which is a dot, it's not a number, so it's okay.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is a dot, adjacent to (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2).\n\nAgain, it's a dot, so no issue.\n\nLooking at (3,1), which is a dot, and I'm placing a flag there, so it's considered a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3), which is a dot, being flagged as a bomb.\n\nThis seems consistent with the numbers around them.\n\nTherefore, I think it's safe to place flags on (2,3) and (3,1).\n\nBut since I only have 10 flags left and 10 bombs remaining, I need to be careful not to place flags on non-bombs.\n\nBut based on this analysis, placing flags on (2,3) and (3,1) seems logical.\n\nHowever, I only need to provide one move at a time.\n\nSo, for this step, I'll place a flag on (2,3).\n\nThen, in the next step, I can place a flag on (3,1), and so on.\n\nBut to confirm, let's see if placing a flag on (2,3) is indeed a good move.\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the analysis, placing a flag on (2,3) satisfies multiple '1's and '2's without causing any conflicts with other numbers.\n\nMOVE: 2,3,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ _

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see some numbers and flags, and a lot of unexplored spaces.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships between the numbers and the flags. Each number indicates how many bombs are adjacent to that cell. Adjacent means the eight surrounding cells: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals.\n\nLet's start by looking at the areas where I have some information.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n- Column 2: 1\n\n- Column 3: 1\n\n- Column 4: 1\n\nSo, positions (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4) all show '1'. This means each of these has exactly one bomb in their adjacent cells.\n\nNow, looking at row 2:\n\n- Column 2: 1\n\n- Column 3: F (flagged)\n\n- Column 4: 1\n\n- Column 5: 1\n\nSo, position (2,3) is flagged, which means there's a bomb there. Now, since (1,3) shows '1', and it's adjacent to (2,3), which is a bomb, that means it can't have any other bombs in its adjacent cells. So, the other adjacent cells to (1,3) should be safe.\n\nLet's list the adjacent cells to (1,3):\n\n- (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\nWe know (2,3) is a bomb. So, the others should be safe. But some of these are already revealed or flagged.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) shows '1', and it's adjacent to (2,3), which is a bomb. So, similar logic applies here.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 3:\n\n- Column 2: 2\n\n- Column 4: .\n\n- Column 5: 2\n\nSo, (3,2) shows '2', which means two bombs in its adjacent cells. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nBut (2,3) is a bomb, and (2,2) is '1', which is already satisfied with (2,3) being a bomb.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the relationships between multiple numbers.\n\nLet's try to look for areas where the number of flags matches the number, and the remaining cells can be safely revealed or where the number of unflagged adjacent cells equals the remaining required bombs.\n\nLooking at (1,3) which is '1', and it's adjacent to (2,3) which is flagged. So, no more bombs can be adjacent to (1,3). Therefore, the other adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nSpecifically, (1,2), (1,4), (0,3), (2,2), (2,4). But some of these might already be revealed.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (1,2) is '_', which is a revealed safe cell.\n\n- (1,4) is '1'.\n\n- (0,3) is '_', revealed safe.\n\n- (2,2) is '1'.\n\n- (2,4) is '1'.\n\nSo, from (1,3)'s perspective, all adjacent cells are either safe or already have their bomb count satisfied. So, no new information here.\n\nLet's look at (3,2) which is '2'. It's adjacent to:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (2,3) is a flagged bomb.\n\n- (2,2) is '1', which already has (2,3) as a bomb, so no more bombs adjacent to it.\n\n- (3,3) is '.', unexplored.\n\n- (4,2) is '2', which is revealed.\n\n- (4,3) is '.', unexplored.\n\n- (2,1) is '.', unexplored.\n\n- (3,1) is '.', unexplored.\n\n- (4,1) is '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, (3,2) needs two bombs adjacent to it. We already have one at (2,3). So, there must be one more bomb among the unexplored cells: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (3,3), (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is '2', and its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (2,5) is '1', which might have its bomb count satisfied.\n\n- (3,4) is '.', unexplored.\n\n- (3,6) is '_', safe.\n\n- (4,5) is '3', which is revealed.\n\n- (4,4) is '1', revealed.\n\n- (2,4) is '1', revealed.\n\n- (2,6) is '_', safe.\n\n- (4,6) is '1', revealed.\n\nSo, (3,5) needs two bombs adjacent to it. Looking at the revealed numbers:\n\n- (4,5) is '3', which needs three bombs adjacent to it.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (3,5) is '2', which we're looking at.\n\n- (3,6) is safe.\n\n- (4,4) is '1'.\n\n- (4,6) is '1'.\n\n- (5,5) is '1', revealed.\n\n- (5,4) is '.', unexplored.\n\n- (5,6) is '_', safe.\n\nSo, (4,5)'s three bombs must be among its adjacent unexplored cells or already flagged cells.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler deduction.\n\nLet's look at row 5:\n\n- Column 5: '1'\n\n- Column 6: '1'\n\n- Column 8: '1'\n\n- Column 9: '1'\n\nSo, positions (5,5), (5,6), (5,8), (5,9) all show '1'. Their adjacent cells might give some information.\n\nLooking at (5,5):\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (4,5) is '3'\n\n- (4,6) is '1'\n\n- (5,4) is '2'\n\n- (5,6) is '1'\n\n- (6,5) is '2'\n\n- (6,6) is '.'\n\n- (6,4) is '2'\n\n- (4,4) is '1'\n\nSo, (5,5) shows '1', and it's adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', which probably has bombs around it.\n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's try to look at the bottom part of the board, like row 8 and 9.\n\nRow 8:\n\n- Column 3: '2'\n\n- Column 4: '1'\n\n- Column 5: '1'\n\n- Column 6: '1'\n\n- Column 7: '1'\n\n- Column 8: '2'\n\n- Column 9: '2'\n\nRow 9:\n\n- Column 6: '1'\n\nLooking at (8,3), which is '2', its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (7,3) is '.'\n\n- (7,4) is '1'\n\n- (8,2) is '.'\n\n- (8,4) is '1'\n\n- (9,3) is '.'\n\n- (9,4) is '.'\n\n- (7,2) is '1'\n\n- (9,2) is '1'\n\nSo, (8,3) needs two bombs in these adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at (7,2), which is '1', adjacent to:\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (7,3) is '.'\n\n- (8,3) is '2'\n\n- (8,2) is '.'\n\n- (7,1) is '.'\n\n- (8,1) is '.'\n\n- (6,2) is '2'\n\n- (6,3) is '3'\n\n- (6,1) is '2'\n\nSo, (7,2) needs one bomb in its adjacent cells. Given that (6,3) is '3', which needs three bombs, and it's adjacent to:\n\n- (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (5,3) is '2'\n\n- (5,4) is '2'\n\n- (6,2) is '2'\n\n- (6,4) is '1'\n\n- (7,3) is '.'\n\n- (7,4) is '1'\n\n- (5,2) is '2'\n\n- (7,2) is '1'\n\nSo, (6,3)'s three bombs must be among its adjacent unexplored cells.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a cell that's definitely safe or definitely a bomb.\n\nLooking back at row 1 and row 2:\n\n(1,2) is '1', adjacent to (2,3), which is a bomb. So, no more bombs can be adjacent to (1,2). Therefore, (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4) should be safe.\n\nBut (0,2) is already revealed as '_'.\n\n(0,3) is '_', safe.\n\n(1,3) is '1', already considered.\n\n(2,2) is '1', already considered.\n\n(2,4) is '1', already considered.\n\nSo, no new information there.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at the cluster around row 3 and column 2.\n\n(3,2) is '2', adjacent to (2,3), which is a bomb, and needs one more bomb in its adjacent unexplored cells.\n\nPossible candidates are (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (3,3), (4,3).\n\nNow, looking at (4,1), which is '.', unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is '.'.\n\n(2,1) is '.'.\n\n(3,3) is '.'.\n\n(4,3) is '.'.\n\nSo, among these five cells, one must be a bomb.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to pinpoint which one.\n\nMaybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 6:\n\n(6,2): '2'\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (5,2) is '2'\n\n- (5,3) is '3'\n\n- (6,1) is '1'\n\n- (6,3) is '2'\n\n- (7,2) is '1'\n\n- (7,3) is '.'\n\n- (5,1) is '2'\n\n- (7,1) is '2'\n\nSo, (6,2) needs two bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at (5,3), which is '3', adjacent to:\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (4,2) is '2'\n\n- (4,3) is '.'\n\n- (4,4) is '1'\n\n- (5,2) is '2'\n\n- (5,4) is '2'\n\n- (6,2) is '2'\n\n- (6,3) is '2'\n\n- (6,4) is '1'\n\nSo, (5,3) needs three bombs in these adjacent cells.\n\nThis seems too convoluted. Maybe I should consider the total number of flags left and the number of potential bomb locations.\n\nCurrently, there's one flag placed at (2,3). There are 9 flags remaining to be placed, and there are 10 bombs in total. So, 9 bombs are still unflagged.\n\nLooking at the board, there are many unexplored cells, so I need to find areas where I can safely place flags or reveal cells without risking a bomb.\n\nPerhaps I should look for cells that must be bombs based on the numbers around them.\n\nLooking at (4,5), which is '3', and its adjacent cells:\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (3,5) is '2'\n\n- (3,6) is '_'\n\n- (4,4) is '1'\n\n- (4,6) is '1'\n\n- (5,5) is '1'\n\n- (5,6) is '_'\n\n- (3,4) is '.'\n\n- (5,4) is '.'\n\nSo, (4,5) needs three bombs in these adjacent cells.\n\nCurrently, (3,5) is '2', which needs two bombs, and (4,4) is '1', which needs one bomb.\n\nLooking at (4,4), which is '1', adjacent to:\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (3,5) is '2'\n\n- (4,5) is '3'\n\n- (5,5) is '1'\n\n- (3,4) is '.'\n\n- (4,3) is '.'\n\n- (5,4) is '.'\n\n- (3,3) is '.'\n\n- (5,3) is '2'\n\nSo, (4,4)'s '1' must have one bomb in its adjacent cells. Possible candidates are (3,4), (4,3), (5,4), (5,3).\n\nBut this is not very helpful.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just pick a cell that seems safe based on the numbers I have.\n\nLooking at (1,2), which is '1', and it's adjacent to (2,3), which is a bomb. So, no more bombs can be adjacent to (1,2). Therefore, (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4) should be safe.\n\nBut (0,2) and (0,3) are already revealed as safe.\n\n(1,3) is '1', already considered.\n\n(2,2) is '1', already considered.\n\n(2,4) is '1', already considered.\n\nSo, no new information there.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at the cluster around row 8 and 9 again.\n\n(8,3) is '2', adjacent to (2,3) which is a bomb, and needs one more bomb in its adjacent unexplored cells: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (3,3), (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, (8,4) is '1', adjacent to:\n\n- (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (7,4) is '1'\n\n- (8,3) is '2'\n\n- (8,5) is '1'\n\n- (9,4) is '.'\n\n- (9,3) is '.'\n\n- (9,5) is '2'\n\n- (7,3) is '.'\n\n- (7,5) is '.'\n\nSo, (8,4)'s '1' must have one bomb in these adjacent cells. Possible candidates are (9,3), (9,4), (7,3), (7,5).\n\nBut this is not very helpful either.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability or look for a cell that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at (0,0), which is '_', safe.\n\nAdjacent to (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (0,2) is '_', safe.\n\n- (1,2) is '1'\n\n- (1,1) is '_'\n\n- (1,0) is '_'\n\n- (0,1) is '_'\n\nSo, (0,0) is safe, and its adjacent cells are also safe, except for (1,2) which is '1', but that's already considered.\n\nSo, maybe I can safely reveal (0,4), which is adjacent to (0,3), which is safe, and (1,4), which is '1'.\n\nBut (1,4) is '1', adjacent to (2,3), which is a bomb, so no more bombs can be adjacent to it. Therefore, (0,4) should be safe.\n\nWait, let's check the adjacent cells of (1,4):\n\n- (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (0,3) is '_', safe.\n\n- (0,4) is '.'\n\n- (0,5) is '.'\n\n- (1,3) is '1'\n\n- (1,5) is '.'\n\n- (2,3) is 'F', bomb.\n\n- (2,4) is '1'\n\n- (2,5) is '1'\n\nSince (1,4) is '1' and adjacent to (2,3), which is a bomb, no more bombs can be adjacent to it. Therefore, (0,4) and (0,5) should be safe.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal (0,4).\n\n**Final Solution**\nTo proceed in this Minesweeper game, we need to make a move that is safe based on the current state of the board. After analyzing the board, I have determined that revealing cell (0,4) is a safe move.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Safe Areas:**\n   - Look for cells that are adjacent to revealed numbers and ensure that all bomb adjacencies are satisfied.\n   - For example, if a cell with the number '1' already has one adjacent flag, the remaining adjacent cells should be safe.\n\n2. **Check Adjacent Cells:**\n   - Examine the cells around known safe or flagged cells to determine which ones can be safely revealed.\n\n3. **Ensure No Conflicts:**\n   - Make sure that placing a flag or revealing a cell does not conflict with the numbers on the board.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a Minesweeper game, the \"code\" is the move we decide to make based on the board state. In this case, the move is to reveal cell (0,4).\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: Cell (1,4) shows '1' and is adjacent to the flagged bomb at (2,3). Therefore, no more bombs can be adjacent to (1,4). This makes cell (0,4) safe to reveal.\nMOVE: 0,4,false\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Cell (1,4):** Shows '1', indicating one adjacent bomb.\n- **Adjacent to (1,4):** Cell (2,3) is flagged as a bomb.\n- **Conclusion:** Since (1,4) already has its adjacent bomb accounted for, the other adjacent cells, including (0,4), are safe.\n- **Move:** Reveal cell (0,4) by setting `flag=false`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are making a safe move without risking hitting a bomb.", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 F 1 _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 . 3 1 _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 2 . . 1 _ 1 1 1\n6 _ 1 2 3 2 1 _ 2 . .\n7 1 2 . 1 _ _ _ 2 . .\n8 . . . 2 1 1 _ 1 2 2\n9 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}

Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nBut (2,3) is a bomb, and (2,2) is '1', which is already satisfied with (2,3) being a bomb.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the relationships between multiple numbers.\n\nLet's try to look for areas where the number of flags matches the number, and the remaining cells can be safely revealed or where the number of unflagged adjacent cells equals the remaining required bombs.\n\nLooking at (1,3) which is '1', and it's adjacent to (2,3) which is flagged. So, no more bombs can be adjacent to (1,3). Therefore, the other adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nSpecifically, (1,2), (1,4), (0,3), (2,2), (2,4). But some of these might already be revealed.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (1,2) is '_', which is a revealed safe cell.\n\n- (1,4) is '1'.\n\n- (0,3) is '_', revealed safe.\n\n- (2,2) is '1'.\n\n- (2,4) is '1'.\n\nSo, from (1,3)'s perspective, all adjacent cells are either safe or already have their bomb count satisfied. So, no new information here.\n\nLet's look at (3,2) which is '2'. It's adjacent to:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (2,3) is a flagged bomb.\n\n- (2,2) is '1', which already has (2,3) as a bomb, so no more bombs adjacent to it.\n\n- (3,3) is '.', unexplored.\n\n- (4,2) is '2', which is revealed.\n\n- (4,3) is '.', unexplored.\n\n- (2,1) is '.', unexplored.\n\n- (3,1) is '.', unexplored.\n\n- (4,1) is '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, (3,2) needs two bombs adjacent to it. We already have one at (2,3). So, there must be one more bomb among the unexplored cells: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (3,3), (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is '2', and its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (2,5) is '1', which might have its bomb count satisfied.\n\n- (3,4) is '.', unexplored.\n\n- (3,6) is '_', safe.\n\n- (4,5) is '3', which is revealed.\n\n- (4,4) is '1', revealed.\n\n- (2,4) is '1', revealed.\n\n- (2,6) is '_', safe.\n\n- (4,6) is '1', revealed.\n\nSo, (3,5) needs two bombs adjacent to it. Looking at the revealed numbers:\n\n- (4,5) is '3', which needs three bombs adjacent to it.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (3,5) is '2', which we're looking at.\n\n- (3,6) is safe.\n\n- (4,4) is '1'.\n\n- (4,6) is '1'.\n\n- (5,5) is '1', revealed.\n\n- (5,4) is '.', unexplored.\n\n- (5,6) is '_', safe.\n\nSo, (4,5)'s three bombs must be among its adjacent unexplored cells or already flagged cells.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler deduction.\n\nLet's look at row 5:\n\n- Column 5: '1'\n\n- Column 6: '1'\n\n- Column 8: '1'\n\n- Column 9: '1'\n\nSo, positions (5,5), (5,6), (5,8), (5,9) all show '1'. Their adjacent cells might give some information.\n\nLooking at (5,5):\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (4,5) is '3'\n\n- (4,6) is '1'\n\n- (5,4) is '2'\n\n- (5,6) is '1'\n\n- (6,5) is '2'\n\n- (6,6) is '.'\n\n- (6,4) is '2'\n\n- (4,4) is '1'\n\nSo, (5,5) shows '1', and it's adjacent to (4,5), which is '3', which probably has bombs around it.\n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's try to look at the bottom part of the board, like row 8 and 9.\n\nRow 8:\n\n- Column 3: '2'\n\n- Column 4: '1'\n\n- Column 5: '1'\n\n- Column 6: '1'\n\n- Column 7: '1'\n\n- Column 8: '2'\n\n- Column 9: '2'\n\nRow 9:\n\n- Column 6: '1'\n\nLooking at (8,3), which is '2', its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (7,3) is '.'\n\n- (7,4) is '1'\n\n- (8,2) is '.'\n\n- (8,4) is '1'\n\n- (9,3) is '.'\n\n- (9,4) is '.'\n\n- (7,2) is '1'\n\n- (9,2) is '1'\n\nSo, (8,3) needs two bombs in these adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at (7,2), which is '1', adjacent to:\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (7,3) is '.'\n\n- (8,3) is '2'\n\n- (8,2) is '.'\n\n- (7,1) is '.'\n\n- (8,1) is '.'\n\n- (6,2) is '2'\n\n- (6,3) is '3'\n\n- (6,1) is '2'\n\nSo, (7,2) needs one bomb in its adjacent cells. Given that (6,3) is '3', which needs three bombs, and it's adjacent to:\n\n- (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (5,3) is '2'\n\n- (5,4) is '2'\n\n- (6,2) is '2'\n\n- (6,4) is '1'\n\n- (7,3) is '.'\n\n- (7,4) is '1'\n\n- (5,2) is '2'\n\n- (7,2) is '1'\n\nSo, (6,3)'s three bombs must be among its adjacent unexplored cells.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a cell that's definitely safe or definitely a bomb.\n\nLooking back at row 1 and row 2:\n\n(1,2) is '1', adjacent to (2,3), which is a bomb. So, no more bombs can be adjacent to (1,2). Therefore, (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4) should be safe.\n\nBut (0,2) is already revealed as '_'.\n\n(0,3) is '_', safe.\n\n(1,3) is '1', already considered.\n\n(2,2) is '1', already considered.\n\n(2,4) is '1', already considered.\n\nSo, no new information there.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at the cluster around row 3 and column 2.\n\n(3,2) is '2', adjacent to (2,3), which is a bomb, and needs one more bomb in its adjacent unexplored cells.\n\nPossible candidates are (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (3,3), (4,3).\n\nNow, looking at (4,1), which is '.', unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is '.'.\n\n(2,1) is '.'.\n\n(3,3) is '.'.\n\n(4,3) is '.'.\n\nSo, among these five cells, one must be a bomb.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to pinpoint which one.\n\nMaybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 6:\n\n(6,2): '2'\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (5,2) is '2'\n\n- (5,3) is '3'\n\n- (6,1) is '1'\n\n- (6,3) is '2'\n\n- (7,2) is '1'\n\n- (7,3) is '.'\n\n- (5,1) is '2'\n\n- (7,1) is '2'\n\nSo, (6,2) needs two bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at (5,3), which is '3', adjacent to:\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (4,2) is '2'\n\n- (4,3) is '.'\n\n- (4,4) is '1'\n\n- (5,2) is '2'\n\n- (5,4) is '2'\n\n- (6,2) is '2'\n\n- (6,3) is '2'\n\n- (6,4) is '1'\n\nSo, (5,3) needs three bombs in these adjacent cells.\n\nThis seems too convoluted. Maybe I should consider the total number of flags left and the number of potential bomb locations.\n\nCurrently, there's one flag placed at (2,3). There are 9 flags remaining to be placed, and there are 10 bombs in total. So, 9 bombs are still unflagged.\n\nLooking at the board, there are many unexplored cells, so I need to find areas where I can safely place flags or reveal cells without risking a bomb.\n\nPerhaps I should look for cells that must be bombs based on the numbers around them.\n\nLooking at (4,5), which is '3', and its adjacent cells:\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (3,5) is '2'\n\n- (3,6) is '_'\n\n- (4,4) is '1'\n\n- (4,6) is '1'\n\n- (5,5) is '1'\n\n- (5,6) is '_'\n\n- (3,4) is '.'\n\n- (5,4) is '.'\n\nSo, (4,5) needs three bombs in these adjacent cells.\n\nCurrently, (3,5) is '2', which needs two bombs, and (4,4) is '1', which needs one bomb.\n\nLooking at (4,4), which is '1', adjacent to:\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (3,5) is '2'\n\n- (4,5) is '3'\n\n- (5,5) is '1'\n\n- (3,4) is '.'\n\n- (4,3) is '.'\n\n- (5,4) is '.'\n\n- (3,3) is '.'\n\n- (5,3) is '2'\n\nSo, (4,4)'s '1' must have one bomb in its adjacent cells. Possible candidates are (3,4), (4,3), (5,4), (5,3).\n\nBut this is not very helpful.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just pick a cell that seems safe based on the numbers I have.\n\nLooking at (1,2), which is '1', and it's adjacent to (2,3), which is a bomb. So, no more bombs can be adjacent to (1,2). Therefore, (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4) should be safe.\n\nBut (0,2) and (0,3) are already revealed as safe.\n\n(1,3) is '1', already considered.\n\n(2,2) is '1', already considered.\n\n(2,4) is '1', already considered.\n\nSo, no new information there.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at the cluster around row 8 and 9.\n\n(8,3) is '2', adjacent to (2,3), which is a bomb, and needs one more bomb in its adjacent unexplored cells.\n\nPossible candidates are (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (3,3), (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, (8,4) is '1', adjacent to:\n\n- (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (7,4) is '1'\n\n- (8,3) is '2'\n\n- (8,5) is '1'\n\n- (9,4) is '.'\n\n- (9,3) is '.'\n\n- (7,3) is '.'\n\n- (9,5) is '2'\n\nSo, (8,4)'s '1' needs one bomb in these adjacent cells. Possible candidates are (7,3), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5).\n\nBut (9,5) is '2', which needs two bombs.\n\nLooking at (9,5), which is '2', adjacent to:\n\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6)\n\nBut since the board is 10x10, row 10 doesn't exist, so only up to (9,6).\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (8,5) is '1'\n\n- (8,6) is '2'\n\n- (9,4) is '.'\n\n- (9,6) is '.'\n\n- (8,4) is '1'\n\nSo, (9,5) needs two bombs in these adjacent cells: (9,4), (9,6).\n\nTherefore, both (9,4) and (9,6) must be bombs.\n\nSo, I can place flags at (9,4) and (9,6).\n\nBut wait, let's confirm this.\n\n(9,5) is '2', and its adjacent cells are (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6).\n\nWe know (8,4) is '1', which needs one bomb, possibly already satisfied by (9,4).\n\nSimilarly, (8,5) is '1', which needs one bomb.\n\nIf I place flags at (9,4) and (9,6), does that satisfy all the numbers?\n\nLet's see:\n\n- (9,5)'s two bombs are satisfied by (9,4) and (9,6).\n\n- (8,4)'s '1' is satisfied by (9,4).\n\n- (8,5)'s '1' needs one bomb, but it's adjacent to (9,5), which is '2', but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\n(9,5) is '2', and its adjacent cells are (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6).\n\nWe need two bombs among these.\n\n(8,4) is '1', which needs one bomb, possibly at (9,4).\n\n(8,5) is '1', which needs one bomb, possibly at (9,5), but (9,5) is already '2'.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to think step by step.\n\nFirst, (9,5) needs two bombs in its adjacent cells: (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6).\n\nNow, (8,4) is '1', which needs one bomb in its adjacent cells: (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5).\n\nFrom (8,4)'s perspective, if (9,4) is a bomb, that satisfies its '1'.\n\nSimilarly, (8,5) is '1', adjacent to (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6).\n\nIf (9,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy (8,5)'s '1'.\n\nBut wait, (9,5) is already '2', which needs two bombs: one at (9,4) and one at (9,6).\n\nBut if (9,5) is '2', and it's adjacent to (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), and if (9,4) and (9,6) are bombs, then (8,4) and (8,5) would have their required bombs satisfied.\n\nLet me check (8,6), which is '2', adjacent to (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7).\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (9,5) is '2'\n\n- (9,6) is '.'\n\n- (9,7) is '.'\n\n- (8,5) is '1'\n\n- (8,7) is '2'\n\n- (7,6) is '1'\n\n- (7,5) is '1'\n\n- (7,7) is '.'\n\nSo, (8,6)'s '2' needs two bombs in these adjacent cells. If (9,6) is a bomb, that's one. Maybe another one is (9,7).\n\nBut I don't have enough information here.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the safest move is to place flags at (9,4) and (9,6), as they seem necessary to satisfy (9,5)'s '2' and (8,4)'s and (8,5)'s '1's.\n\nBut before doing that, I need to ensure that I have enough flags left.\n\nCurrently, there are 9 flags remaining, and I'm proposing to place two more, making a total of 11 flags, but the total number of bombs is 10, which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, initially, there is one flag at (2,3), and 9 flags remaining, with 10 bombs in total.\n\nIf I place flags at (9,4) and (9,6), that would make three flags placed, with seven flags remaining and seven bombs left to find (since total bombs are 10).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I'm not misplacing flags.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just place one flag and see.\n\nLooking back, maybe I should consider that (9,5)'s two bombs are at (9,4) and (9,6), and place flags there.\n\nBut since I only have nine flags left and need to place two more, that would use up 11 flags, which is more than the total bombs, which is not possible.\n\nWait, no. Initially, there is one flag already placed at (2,3), and nine flags remaining. So, I can place up to nine more flags.\n\nIf I place flags at (9,4) and (9,6), that would be placing two more flags, making a total of three flags placed, with seven flags remaining and seven bombs left to find.\n\nThat seems okay.\n\nBut perhaps I should confirm if these are indeed bombs.\n\nLooking at (9,4) and (9,6):\n\n- (9,4) is adjacent to (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,3), (9,5), (10,3), (10,4), (10,5). But since it's a 10x10 board, row 10 doesn't exist, so only up to (9,5).\n\n- Similarly, (9,6) is adjacent to (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7), (10,5), (10,6), (10,7). Again, row 10 doesn't exist.\n\nGiven that, placing flags at (9,4) and (9,6) seems reasonable based on the numbers.\n\nTherefore, I'll place a flag at (9,4).\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the numbers around, particularly (9,5)'s '2' and (8,4)'s '1', it seems necessary to place flags at (9,4) and (9,6). However, to proceed step by step, I'll place a flag at (9,4) first.\n\nMOVE: 9,4,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 F 1 _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 . 3 1 _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 2 . . 1 _ 1 1 1\n6 _ 1 2 3 2 1 _ 2 . .\n7 1 2 . 1 _ _ _ 2 . .\n8 . . . 2 1 1 _ 1 2 2\n9 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
