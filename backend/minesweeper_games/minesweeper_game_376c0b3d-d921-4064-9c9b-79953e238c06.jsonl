{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 5, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "To analyze the game state, we need to evaluate the revealed numbers and their adjacent squares. Let's outline the current state and assess potential moves.\n\nThe revealed numbers on the board are located at the following coordinates:\n- (3,3): 1\n- (3,4): 2\n- (3,5): 1\n- (4,3): 1\n- (4,4): 2\n- (5,3): 1\n- (5,4): 2\n\n### Adjacent Squares Analysis:\n1. **At (3,3)**: \n   - 1 \u2192 Adjacent squares are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n   - Already has a visible number of 1, so it can only have 1 adjacent bomb. If we assume (3,4) is not a bomb, then at least one adjacent slot must be a flag.\n\n2. **At (3,4)**:\n   - 2 \u2192 Must have 2 bombs in adjacent squares (one of which cannot be (3,3) since it only counts one).\n   - If we flag 1 adjacent square, we still need to find another flag among the remaining adjacent squares (3,3) was already revealed and must have nearby bombs.\n\n3. **At (3,5)**:\n   - 1 \u2192 Can only have 1 bomb.\n   - Therefore, since (3,4) is non-bomb confirmed (it must sum correctly), and since it directly counts for its 2 adjacency needs.\n\n4. **At (4,3)**:\n   - 1 \u2192 Similar analysis as (3,3).\n\n5. **At (4,4)**:\n   - 2 \u2192 Similar analysis as (3,4).\n\n6. **At (5,3)**:\n   - 1 \u2192 Similar as above.\n\n7. **At (5,4)**:\n   - 2 \u2192 Also counts on adjacent bombs similarly to (4,4).\n\n### Current Flag Placement Observations:\nAdjacent flags are not clearly verified because no flags are currently placed on the board and would need to ensure that their placements are validated against the revealed numbers. \n\n### Next Steps:\nBased on the numbers presented, we lack any conflicts. However, as a safe bet to help determine flags given the density of the numbers nearby, I will place a flag on (4, 5), as we've recognized a clear lack of potential bombs surrounding while still being within rules regarding proximity and present counts. \n\n#### Final Move:\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (4, 5) because it counts as necessary per proximity rules, given fewer locations where bombs can emerge without conflicting with numbers shown. \nMOVE: 4,5,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . 1 2 1 . . . .\n4 . . . 1 2 . . . . .\n5 . . . 1 . 2 . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
