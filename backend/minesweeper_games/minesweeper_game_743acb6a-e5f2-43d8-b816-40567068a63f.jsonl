Given the rules and the state of the board, the next logical step is to reveal a tile that could provide more information about the board's state without immediately risking revealing a bomb. Looking at the board, revealing a tile adjacent to a revealed number could provide useful insights, especially if it's near a tile with a low number, as this could help determine the location of bombs more accurately. \n\nConsidering the board's current state and the rules provided, revealing a tile near a '1' could be particularly insightful, as it would either reveal another number or a blank space, both of which could help in deducing the locations of bombs. The position (2,3) is interesting because it's adjacent to several revealed tiles, including a '1' and a couple of '2's and '3's, which could provide valuable information upon revelation.\n\nMOVE: 2,3,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 . 2 1 . . .\n4 _ _ _ 2 2 3 . . . .\n5 _ _ _ 1 . 2 2 . . .\n6 _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . .\n7 _ 1 1 2 . . . . . .\n8 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n9 _ 1 . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Given the rules and the current state, a strategic move would be to reveal a tile that could provide the most information about the board's state, especially around areas with revealed numbers. Revealing a tile adjacent to a revealed number can help determine the location of bombs and reduce the number of possible bomb locations. Considering the board's current state, revealing a tile near the top-left corner, where there are fewer revealed tiles, might not be as informative as revealing a tile in an area with more revealed numbers. The area around (2,3) to (2,6) and the adjacent rows shows a cluster of revealed numbers, making it a good candidate for further exploration. Specifically, revealing the tile at (3,4) could provide insight into the arrangement of bombs around the revealed '2' and '1' tiles, potentially helping to identify bomb locations or safe tiles.\n\nMOVE: 3,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 . 2 1 . . .\n4 _ _ _ 2 2 3 . . . .\n5 _ _ _ 1 . 2 2 . . .\n6 _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . .\n7 _ 1 1 2 . . . . . .\n8 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n9 _ 1 . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
