This helps start the game, with the hope of revealing a number that will provide more information about the surrounding tiles. It is generally a good strategy to start by revealing a tile in a corner or at the center to maximize the potential exposure of empty tiles.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Let's examine potential flag placements and safe tiles to reveal:\n\n1. Look at the tile at (0,6) which shows '1'. There are three adjacent unexplored tiles: (0,5), (1,5), and (1,6). Since (1,7) is numbered '1' and there is already one flag at the top (1,8), and (1,6) is most likely a bomb. Similarly, the adjacent number '1' at (0,7) reinforces that one of these tiles is likely a bomb.\n\n2. The number '2' at (1,9) has one adjacent unexplored tile at (2,9), and it must be a bomb because there are no other options.\n\n3. Consider the tile at (5,5) which displays '2'. There are exactly two unexplored tiles adjacent: (5,6) and (6,5). From previous deductions, (5,6) and (6,5) likely contain bombs, but to verify safely, we could opt to reveal surrounding safe spots incrementally reducing suspected tile spaces.\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the analysis above, place a flag at (2,9) since the '2' at (1,9) necessitates that (2,9) must be a bomb.\nMOVE: 2,9,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 1\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n4 1 2 1 1 _ 1 2 . 1 _\n5 . . . 1 _ 2 . 3 1 _\n6 1 2 1 1 _ 2 . 2 _ _\n7 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 2 2\n8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}

Specifically, let's look at the number 2 on (1,9) and the flagged bomb at (2,9). Currently, (1,9) has one flag, which means there should be one more bomb in its immediate unrevealed neighbors. The neighbors are (0,8), (0,9), and (2,9); (2,9) is already flagged, leaving (0,8) and (0,9) as potential bomb locations. The revealed number at (0,6) has only one unknown space next to it, which is (0,7). Since (0,6) shows only one bomb, (0,7) must be safe to reveal because the only bomb it refers to is in another direction, most notably (0,8) or (0,9).\n\nMOVE: 0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 1\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ F\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n4 1 2 1 1 _ 1 2 . 1 _\n5 . . . 1 _ 2 . 3 1 _\n6 1 2 1 1 _ 2 . 2 _ _\n7 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 2 2\n8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": false}
