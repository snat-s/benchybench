{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The board is completely unexplored, all squares are still dots. The game is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining. Since the entire board is hidden, there's no information to go on. The first move in Minesweeper is usually a safe click. Typically, players start by clicking the center or a corner, but since all squares are equally likely to be safe at the beginning, maybe the best bet is to click somewhere in the middle. Wait, but in some versions, the first click is guaranteed to be safe and not a bomb. If that's the case here, then any square I choose to reveal first should be safe. But the problem is, the game info doesn't mention that the first move is safe. Hmm. Wait, the rules here don't specify that the first click is safe. So maybe in this scenario, the first move could hit a bomb. But that's a 10/100 chance, which is 10% probability. But since the user is asking for a move, and the board is all unexplored, there's no way to use any logic here. So the only possible move is to pick a random square and reveal it. Since there's no information, any choice is as good as another. But maybe there's a common strategy. Often, people click the center area first because bombs are sometimes placed on the edges, but that's not a rule here. Alternatively, maybe the corners are less likely to have bombs? But with 10 bombs on a 10x10 grid, each square has a 10% chance. So the first move is a gamble. But perhaps the best approach is to pick a corner, like (0,0), but maybe the middle. Let's say I choose the center tile, like (5,5). But since there's no prior information, any coordinate is possible. Alternatively, maybe the user expects a specific answer here. Wait, but the problem says \"Provide your next move in this format\". Since all squares are unexplored, the only possible move is to reveal a square. So the explanation would be that since the board is completely unexplored, the first move must be a random reveal. So I'll pick a coordinate, maybe (4,4) or (5,5). Let's go with (5,5) as the center. So the move would be x=5, y=5, flag=false. The explanation is that with no information, the first move is to reveal a central tile to maximize the information gained, as central reveals tend to open up more adjacent squares.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The entire board is unexplored.
