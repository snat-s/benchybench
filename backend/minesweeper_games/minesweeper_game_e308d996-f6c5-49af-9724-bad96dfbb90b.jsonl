Since no flags are placed yet, this step is straightforward\u2014there are no conflicts to resolve.\n\n### **Step 2: Looking for Obvious Conflicts**\n\nSince there are no flags placed, there are no obvious conflicts at this stage.\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Remaining Flags vs. Bombs**\n\nWe have `10` flags remaining and `10` bombs on the board. This means that every flag we place should correspond to a bomb.\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying Safe Moves and Potential Flag Placements**\n\nLet's analyze each revealed number to determine where flags can be placed or where tiles can be safely revealed.\n\n#### **Analyzing Position (4,4): `1`**\n\nThis `1` indicates that there is exactly one bomb in the surrounding eight squares. Let's list all adjacent positions:\n\n```\n(3,3) (3,4) (3,5)\n(4,3)       (4,5)\n(5,3) (5,4) (5,5)\n```\n\nLooking at the surrounding positions:\n\n- `(5,4)` is also a `2`, which we'll analyze next.\n- `(5,5)` is a `1`, which we'll also analyze.\n\nSince we don't have any flags yet, we need to deduce where the bomb might be.\n\n#### **Analyzing Position (5,4): `2`**\n\nThis `2` indicates that there are exactly two bombs in the surrounding eight squares. Let's list its adjacent positions:\n\n```\n(4,3) (4,4) (4,5)\n(5,3)       (5,5)\n(6,3) (6,4) (6,5)\n```\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- `(4,4)` is a `1`.\n- `(5,5)` is a `1`.\n- `(6,4)` is a `1`.\n\nThis means that among `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, `(5,3)`, `(5,5)`, `(6,3)`, `(6,5)`, there are two bombs.\n\n#### **Analyzing Position (5,5): `1`**\n\nThis `1` indicates exactly one bomb in its adjacent positions:\n\n```\n(4,4) (4,5) (4,6)\n(5,4)       (5,6)\n(6,4) (6,5) (6,6)\n```\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- `(4,4)` is a `1`.\n- `(5,4)` is a `2`.\n- `(6,4)` is a `1`.\n\nThis suggests that among `(4,5)`, `(4,6)`, `(5,6)`, `(6,5)`, `(6,6)`, there is exactly one bomb.\n\n#### **Analyzing Position (6,4): `1`**\n\nThis `1` indicates exactly one bomb in its adjacent positions:\n\n```\n(5,3) (5,4) (5,5)\n(6,3)       (6,5)\n(7,3) (7,4) (7,5)\n```\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- `(5,4)` is a `2`.\n- `(5,5)` is a `1`.\n- `(6,5)` is a `1`.\n\nThis suggests that among `(5,3)`, `(6,3)`, `(7,3)`, `(7,4)`, `(7,5)`, there is exactly one bomb.\n\n### **Deductive Reasoning to Place Flags**\n\nLet's try to deduce the positions of the bombs based on the numbers.\n\n#### **Focusing on Position (5,4): `2`**\n\nWe need to find two bombs among `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, `(5,3)`, `(5,5)`, `(6,3)`, `(6,5)`.\n\nLooking at `(5,5): `1`:\n\nIt indicates exactly one bomb in its adjacent positions: `(4,5)`, `(4,6)`, `(5,6)`, `(6,5)`, `(6,6)`.\n\nHowever, let's focus on the overlap between `(5,4)` and `(5,5)`.\n\nIf we assume `(5,5)` is a bomb, then:\n\n- It would satisfy the `1` at `(5,5)`.\n- It would contribute one bomb to `(5,4)`.\n\nBut `(5,4)` needs two bombs, so there must be another bomb among `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, `(5,3)`, `(6,3)`, `(6,5)`.\n\nLooking at `(6,5): `1`:\n\nIt indicates exactly one bomb in its adjacent positions: `(5,4)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,6)`, `(6,4)`, `(6,6)`, `(7,4)`, `(7,5)`, `(7,6)`.\n\nBut since `(5,4)` is a `2`, and `(5,5)` could be a bomb, let's consider `(5,5)` as a bomb.\n\nIf `(5,5)` is a bomb, then:\n\n- It satisfies `(5,5): `1`.\n- It contributes one bomb to `(5,4): `2`, so there needs to be another bomb adjacent to `(5,4)`.\n\nLooking at `(6,5): `1`:\n\nIf `(5,5)` is a bomb, then `(6,5)` cannot be a bomb because `(5,5)` already satisfies the `1` at `(5,5)`.\n\nThus, `(6,5)` is safe, and the bomb adjacent to `(6,5)` is `(5,5)`.\n\nNow, going back to `(5,4): `2`, we have one bomb at `(5,5)`, so there needs to be another bomb among `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, `(5,3)`, `(6,3)`.\n\nLooking at `(4,4): `1`:\n\nThis indicates exactly one bomb among `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`, `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, `(5,3)`, `(5,4)`, `(5,5)`.\n\nWe've already considered `(5,5)` as a bomb, so:\n\nIf `(5,5)` is a bomb, then there cannot be another bomb adjacent to `(4,4)`. Therefore, `(4,3)` and `(4,5)` cannot be bombs.\n\nBut this contradicts our earlier deduction that there needs to be another bomb adjacent to `(5,4)` among `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, `(5,3)`, `(6,3)`.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that our initial assumption that `(5,5)` is a bomb might be incorrect.\n\n#### **Re-evaluating the Assumption**\n\nLet's consider that `(5,5)` is not a bomb.\n\nIf `(5,5)` is not a bomb, then:\n\n- The `1` at `(5,5)` must be satisfied by one of its other adjacent positions: `(4,5)`, `(4,6)`, `(5,6)`, `(6,5)`, `(6,6)`.\n\nLooking at `(6,5): `1`:\n\nIt needs exactly one bomb among its adjacent positions: `(5,4)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,6)`, `(6,4)`, `(6,6)`, `(7,4)`, `(7,5)`, `(7,6)`.\n\nSince `(5,5)` is not a bomb, the bomb adjacent to `(6,5)` must be among `(5,4)`, `(5,6)`, `(6,6)`.\n\nBut `(5,4)` is a `2`, which requires two bombs in its adjacent positions.\n\nIf `(5,5)` is not a bomb, then `(5,4)` needs two bombs among `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, `(5,3)`, `(6,3)`.\n\nLooking at `(4,4): `1`:\n\nIf `(5,5)` is not a bomb, then the bomb adjacent to `(4,4)` must be among `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`, `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, `(5,3)`, `(5,4)`.\n\nGiven that `(5,4)` needs two bombs among `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, `(5,3)`, `(6,3)`, let's assume that `(4,3)` and `(4,5)` are bombs.\n\nIf `(4,3)` is a bomb:\n\n- It satisfies `(4,4): `1`.\n- It contributes one bomb to `(5,4): `2`.\n\nIf `(4,5)` is a bomb:\n\n- It also contributes one bomb to `(5,4): `2`.\n\nThis would satisfy `(5,4): `2`.\n\nNow, let's check for consistency with other numbers.\n\nLooking at `(5,5): `1`:\n\nIt needs exactly one bomb among `(4,5)`, `(4,6)`, `(5,6)`, `(6,5)`, `(6,6)`.\n\nIf `(4,5)` is a bomb, then `(5,5)` is satisfied.\n\nLooking at `(6,5): `1`:\n\nIt needs exactly one bomb among `(5,4)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,6)`, `(6,4)`, `(6,6)`, `(7,4)`, `(7,5)`, `(7,6)`.\n\nSince `(5,5)` is not a bomb (as per our new assumption), and `(5,4)` is a `2` with bombs at `(4,3)` and `(4,5)`, `(5,4)` is not a bomb.\n\nThus, the bomb adjacent to `(6,5)` must be among `(5,6)`, `(6,6)`.\n\nLooking at `(6,6): `1`:\n\nIt needs exactly one bomb among its adjacent positions: `(5,5)`, `(5,6)`, `(5,7)`, `(6,5)`, `(6,7)`, `(7,5)`, `(7,6)`, `(7,7)`.\n\nSince `(5,5)` is not a bomb, and `(6,5)` needs a bomb, let's assume `(6,5)` is a bomb.\n\nIf `(6,5)` is a bomb:\n\n- It satisfies `(6,5): `1`.\n- It also satisfies `(6,6): `1`, since it's adjacent to `(6,6)`.\n\nNow, let's check `(5,6): `1`:\n\nIt needs exactly one bomb among `(4,5)`, `(4,6)`, `(4,7)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,7)`, `(6,5)`, `(6,6)`, `(6,7)`.\n\nSince `(6,5)` is a bomb, `(5,6)` is satisfied.\n\nFinally, let's check `(4,6): `1`:\n\nIt needs exactly one bomb among `(3,5)`, `(3,6)`, `(3,7)`, `(4,5)`, `(4,7)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,6)`, `(5,7)`.\n\nSince `(4,5)` is a bomb, `(4,6)` is satisfied.\n\nThis setup seems consistent so far.\n\n### **Summarizing Flag Placements**\n\nBased on the above deductions, we can place flags at the following positions:\n\n1. `(4,3)`: Bomb\n2. `(4,5)`: Bomb\n3. `(6,5)`: Bomb\n\nThese placements satisfy all the revealed numbers without any conflicts.\n\n### **Counting the Flags**\n\nWe've placed `3` flags, leaving us with `7` flags remaining.\n\n### **Identifying Safe Tiles to Reveal**\n\nNow that we've placed some flags, let's look for tiles that are safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at `(6,6): `1`:\n\nSince `(6,5)` is a bomb (flagged), the tile `(6,6)` is safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, `(5,6): `1`:\n\nAdjacent to `(6,5)` (flagged bomb), so `(5,6)` is safe to reveal.\n\n`(4,7): `1`:\n\nAdjacent to `(4,5)` (flagged bomb), so `(4,7)` is safe to reveal.\n\n`(3,3): `1`:\n\nAdjacent to `(4,3)` (flagged bomb), so `(3,3)` is safe to reveal.\n\n`(3,5): `1`:\n\nAdjacent to `(4,5)` (flagged bomb), so `(3,5)` is safe to reveal.\n\n`(5,3): `1`:\n\nAdjacent to `(4,3)` (flagged bomb), so `(5,3)` is safe to reveal.\n\n`(6,3): `1`:\n\nAdjacent to `(5,3)` (flagged bomb), so `(6,3)` is safe to reveal.\n\nHowever, looking back, we notice that `(5,3)` and `(6,3)` were not flagged but are adjacent to `(4,3)` and `(6,5)` respectively. But since `(4,3)` is flagged, `(5,3)` is safe, and `(6,3)` is safe.\n\n### **Choosing the Next Move**\n\nGiven the deductions, a safe move would be to reveal a tile that is guaranteed not to be a bomb based on the existing flags.\n\nLet's choose `(6,6)` to reveal, as it's adjacent to a flagged bomb at `(6,5)` and should be safe.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the analysis, positions `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, and `(6,5)` are flagged as bombs, satisfying the adjacent numbered tiles. The tile at `(6,6)` is safe to reveal as it's adjacent to a flagged bomb at `(6,5)`.\n\n**MOVE:** 6,6,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . 1 . 1 . . .\n5 . . . . 2 1 1 . . .\n6 . . . . 1 1 1 . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Square `(4,4)` with Value `1`\n\nAdjacent squares: `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`, `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, `(5,3)`, `(5,4)`, `(5,5)`.\n\nIf `(4,5)` is a bomb (from the assumption above), then no other adjacent squares can be bombs.\n\n#### d. Square `(4,6)` with Value `1`\n\nAdjacent squares: `(3,5)`, `(3,6)`, `(3,7)`, `(4,5)`, `(4,7)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,6)`, `(5,7)`.\n\nIf `(4,5)` is a bomb, then no other adjacent squares can be bombs.\n\n#### e. Square `(6,5)` with Value `1`\n\nAdjacent squares: `(5,4)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,6)`, `(6,4)`, `(6,6)`, `(7,4)`, `(7,5)`, `(7,6)`.\n\nIf we assume `(6,5)` is not a bomb, then exactly one of `(5,6)`, `(7,4)`, `(7,5)`, or `(7,6)` is a bomb.\n\n### Step 6: Making Logical Deductions\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n\n1. **If `(4,5)` is a bomb:**\n   - Then `(6,5)` is safe.\n   - For `(5,4)` with value `2`, one bomb is at `(4,5)`, so the second bomb must be among `(4,3)`, `(5,3)`, `(6,3)`, or `(6,5)`.\n   - Since `(6,5)` is safe, the second bomb must be among `(4,3)`, `(5,3)`, or `(6,3)`.\n\n2. **If `(6,5)` is a bomb:**\n   - Then `(4,5)` is safe.\n   - For `(5,5)` with value `1`, only `(6,5)` is a bomb, so this is consistent.\n   - For `(5,4)` with value `2`, one bomb is at `(6,5)`, so the second bomb must be among `(4,3)`, `(4,5)`, `(5,3)`, or `(6,3)`.\n   - Since `(4,5)` is safe, the second bomb must be among `(4,3)`, `(5,3)`, or `(6,3)`.\n\nIn both scenarios, the second bomb for `(5,4)` must be among `(4,3)`, `(5,3)`, or `(6,3)`.\n\n### Step 7: Deciding the Next Move\n\nGiven the above deductions, the safest move is to reveal a square that doesn't have a bomb based on our current assumptions.\n\n#### Option 1: Reveal `(6,5)`\n\nIf we reveal `(6,5)`:\n\n- If it's safe, we can proceed without worrying about it being a bomb.\n- If it's a bomb, we'll know that `(4,5)` is safe.\n\nHowever, revealing `(6,5)` could be risky if it's a bomb, leading to losing the game.\n\n#### Option 2: Reveal `(4,5)`\n\nSimilarly, revealing `(4,5)`:\n\n- If it's safe, we know `(6,5)` must be the bomb.\n- If it's a bomb, `(6,5)` is safe.\n\nAgain, this carries the risk of revealing a bomb.\n\n#### Option 3: Look for a Safer Reveal\n\nLet's see if there's a square that is guaranteed to be safe based on the current information.\n\nLooking at `(5,3)`, `(6,3)`, and `(4,3)`:\n\n- If we assume one of these is a bomb for `(5,4)` with value `2`, and considering `(4,5)` or `(6,5)` is a bomb, we can try to find a safe square.\n\nHowever, without more information, it's challenging to determine which of these is safe.\n\n#### Option 4: Reveal a Square with No Adjacent Bombs\n\nLooking at the board, the squares around `(4,4)` and `(4,6)` have some unexplored adjacent squares, but they're all interconnected.\n\nGiven the complexity, the safest move is to reveal a square that, based on our assumptions, is less likely to be a bomb.\n\nFor example, revealing `(5,3)`:\n\n- If it's safe, it helps in narrowing down the bomb locations.\n- If it's a bomb, it provides crucial information for other squares.\n\nHowever, there's still a risk involved.\n\n#### Decision:\n\nGiven the uncertainty, the best approach is to reveal a square that, based on our deductions, is less likely to be a bomb. Since both `(4,5)` and `(6,5)` have a 50% chance of being a bomb, revealing either carries risk. However, revealing a square like `(5,3)` might provide more information without immediately risking the game.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be to reveal `(5,3)`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the analysis of the revealed numbers and adjacent squares, revealing `(5,3)` is the safest move as it provides critical information about bomb locations without immediately risking a game-ending reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 5,3,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . 1 . 1 . . .\n5 . . . . 2 1 1 . . .\n6 . . . . 1 1 1 . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "### Understanding the Board and Rules\n\nFirst, I need to familiarize myself with the current state of the Minesweeper board. The board is 10x10, with 10 bombs hidden among the tiles. The game provides information through revealed numbers, which indicate how many bombs are adjacent to a particular tile. Flags mark potential bomb locations, and unexplored tiles are denoted by dots (`.`).\n\n### Analyzing Revealed Numbers and Flags\n\nI'll start by examining each revealed number and comparing it with the adjacent flags to ensure consistency.\n\n1. **Tile (0,3) shows '1' with flags at (0,2) and (0,4):**\n   - This is a conflict because a '1' indicates exactly one adjacent bomb, but there are two adjacent flags. This suggests that at least one of these flags is incorrect.\n\n2. **Tile (1,3) shows '2' with flags at (1,4):**\n   - A '2' indicates two adjacent bombs, and there's only one flag, so there must be another bomb among the adjacent unexplored tiles.\n\n3. **Tile (3,4) shows '2' with no adjacent flags:**\n   - This means there are exactly two bombs among its adjacent unexplored tiles.\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves\n\nGiven the conflict at tile (0,3), I need to resolve it. Since tile (0,3) shows '1' but has two adjacent flags, one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\n- **Flag at (0,2):** This flag is adjacent to tile (0,3) and tile (1,3), which shows '2'. If the flag at (0,2) is correct, then there's already one bomb accounted for at (1,3), meaning there must be another bomb among its other adjacent tiles.\n\n- **Flag at (0,4):** This flag is adjacent only to tile (0,3). Since tile (0,3) shows '1' and already has a flag at (0,2), the flag at (0,4) must be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I should remove the flag at (0,4).\n\n### Planning the Next Move\n\nWith the flag at (0,4) removed, I need to decide whether to reveal a tile or place a new flag.\n\nLooking at tile (1,3) which shows '2' and already has one flag at (1,4), there must be another bomb among its adjacent unexplored tiles: (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nHowever, since (0,4) is now unflagged and unexplored, it's a potential candidate for revealing or flagging. But before doing that, I should ensure there are no more conflicts or clear moves.\n\n### Checking for Other Conflicts or Safe Reveals\n\nExamining tile (3,4) which shows '2' with no adjacent flags, I need to look at its adjacent unexplored tiles: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nSince we have limited information here, it's safer to focus on areas where we can make definitive moves.\n\n### Deciding on the Next Action\n\nGiven the analysis, the most logical next step is to remove the incorrect flag at (0,4) to resolve the conflict at tile (0,3).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (0,3) shows '1' but has two adjacent flags at (0,2) and (0,4). Since a '1' can only have one adjacent bomb, the flag at (0,4) must be incorrect. Removing this flag will help clarify the board and allow for more informed moves.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,4,false\n\n*(Note: Setting `flag=false` indicates removal of the existing flag at (0,4).)*\n\n### Verifying the Move\n\nAfter removing the flag at (0,4):\n\n- Tile (0,3) now correctly has one adjacent flag at (0,2), aligning with its '1' indicator.\n- This removal may open up new possibilities for revealing safe tiles or identifying bomb locations based on the updated information.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy methodically analyzing each revealed number and its adjacent flags, I was able to identify and resolve a critical conflict on the board. Removing the incorrect flag at (0,4) ensures that the game progresses accurately, reducing the risk of uncovering a bomb prematurely. This step is crucial in Minesweeper, as it maintains the integrity of the revealed information and guides future moves towards successfully completing the game.\n\n**Final Move:**  \n**EXPLANATION:** Removing the incorrect flag at (0,4) to resolve the conflict with tile (0,3) showing '1'.  \n**MOVE:** 0,4,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ F 1 F . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 2 F . . . . .\n2 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 1 2 . . . . .\n4 _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 . . .\n5 _ _ 1 1 2 1 1 . . .\n6 _ _ 1 . 1 1 1 . . .\n7 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n8 1 1 1 . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Adjacent tiles: (0,2) [Flagged], (0,4) [Flagged], (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). Wait a minute, there are two adjacent flags at (0,2) and (0,4). But the number is '1', indicating only one bomb should be adjacent. This seems like a conflict.\n\n**Identifying Conflicts:**\n\nUpon closer inspection, Tile (0,3) shows '1' but has two adjacent flags at (0,2) and (0,4). According to the rules, if a numbered tile shows '1', but already has an adjacent flag, there cannot be another bomb next to it. Therefore, having two flags adjacent to Tile (0,3) violates this rule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis suggests that one of the flags adjacent to Tile (0,3) might be incorrect.\n\n### **Step 2: Resolving the Flag Conflict**\n\n**Possible Scenarios:**\n\n1. **Flag at (0,2) is correct:** Then, the flag at (0,4) is incorrect.\n2. **Flag at (0,4) is correct:** Then, the flag at (0,2) is incorrect.\n\n**Analyzing Tile (0,2):**\n\nLet's examine if the flag at (0,2) is necessary.\n\nAdjacent to (0,2): Tiles (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\n- Tile (0,3) shows '1' and has a flag at (0,2), which could be the bomb it's indicating.\n  \n**Analyzing Tile (0,4):**\n\nAdjacent to (0,4): Tiles (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5).\n\n- Tile (0,3) shows '1' with a flag at (0,4). Since Tile (0,3) already has a flag at (0,2), the flag at (0,4) is extra.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven that Tile (0,3) only requires one adjacent bomb, and we have two flags, the flag at (0,4) seems to be the incorrect one.\n\n### **Step 3: Removing the Incorrect Flag**\n\n**Action:**\n\nRemove the flag at (0,4).\n\n**Move:**\n\n```\nMOVE: 0,4,false\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nBy removing the flag at (0,4), we resolve the conflict at Tile (0,3). Now, Tile (0,3) correctly has one adjacent bomb at (0,2).\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying Other Numbered Tiles**\n\nLet's ensure there are no other conflicts on the board.\n\n**Tile (1,3):** Displays '2'. Adjacent tiles: (0,2) [Flagged], (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nCurrently, there's only one flag adjacent at (0,2). Since the number is '2', there should be one more bomb adjacent to this tile.\n\n**Potential Bomb Locations:**\n\nLooking at the adjacent unexplored tiles: (0,4) [just unflagged], (1,4), (2,3), (2,4).\n\n**Analyzing Tile (1,4):**\n\nAdjacent to (1,4): Tiles (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nTile (1,3) shows '2' with one flag at (0,2). If we assume (1,4) is a bomb, let's check for conflicts.\n\n**Tile (1,5):** Displays '1'. Adjacent tiles: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6).\n\nIf (1,4) is a bomb, then adjacent to (1,5): one bomb at (1,4), which matches the number '1'. No conflict.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPlacing a flag at (1,4) would satisfy the '2' at (1,3) without causing conflicts elsewhere.\n\n### **Step 5: Placing a New Flag**\n\n**Action:**\n\nPlace a flag at (1,4).\n\n**Move:**\n\n```\nMOVE: 1,4,true\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nBy flagging (1,4), we ensure that Tile (1,3) has exactly two adjacent bombs: one at (0,2) and one at (1,4). This maintains consistency across the board.\n\n### **Step 6: Reviewing Remaining Flags and Bombs**\n\n**Flags Remaining:** 6 (since we removed one and placed one).\n\n**Bombs Remaining:** 10 - 2 (flagged at (0,2) and (1,4)) = 8.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nNow, I'll look for other tiles that can help determine the locations of the remaining bombs.\n\n**Tile (3,4):** Displays '2'.

Adjacent tiles: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nCurrently, no flags are adjacent to Tile (3,3). Therefore, one of its adjacent unexplored tiles must be a bomb.\n\n**Potential Bomb Locations:**\n\nLooking at the adjacent unexplored tiles: (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,3).\n\n**Analyzing Tile (4,4):** Displays '1'. Adjacent tiles: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nCurrently, no flags are adjacent to Tile (4,4). Therefore, one of its adjacent unexplored tiles must be a bomb.\n\n**Potential Bomb Locations:**\n\nLooking at the adjacent unexplored tiles: (3,5), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\n**Identifying Safe Moves:**\n\nGiven the complexity, it might be safer to reveal a tile that doesn't have a high probability of being a bomb. For example, revealing (3,5) could provide more information without risking a bomb.\n\n**Action:**\n\nReveal tile (3,5).\n\n**Move:**\n\n```\nMOVE: 3,5,false\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nRevealing (3,5) will help clarify the number of bombs adjacent to Tiles (3,4) and (4,4), allowing for more informed decisions in subsequent moves.\n\n### **Step 7: Continuing the Analysis**\n\nAssuming Tile (3,5) is revealed and shows a number or is empty, I can proceed accordingly. However, since this is a hypothetical scenario, I'll proceed based on the current board state.\n\n**Tile (6,2):** Displays '1'. Adjacent tiles: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3).\n\n**Analyzing Adjacent Tiles:**\n\n- (5,1): Unexplored.\n- (5,2): Displays '1'.\n- (5,3): Displays '1'.\n- (6,1): Unexplored.\n- (6,3): Displays '.'.\n- (7,1): Unexplored.\n- (7,2): Displays '1'.\n- (7,3): Unexplored.\n\n**Tile (5,2):** Displays '1'. Adjacent tiles: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\n\nCurrently, no flags are adjacent to Tile (5,2). Therefore, one of its adjacent unexplored tiles must be a bomb.\n\n**Potential Bomb Locations:**\n\nLooking at the adjacent unexplored tiles: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3).\n\n**Tile (7,2):** Displays '1'. Adjacent tiles: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3).\n\nCurrently, no flags are adjacent to Tile (7,2). Therefore, one of its adjacent unexplored tiles must be a bomb.\n\n**Potential Bomb Locations:**\n\nLooking at the adjacent unexplored tiles: (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3).\n\n**Identifying Safe Moves:**\n\nGiven the overlapping potential bomb locations, it's prudent to reveal a tile that can provide the most information. Revealing (5,1) could help determine the bomb adjacent to Tile (5,2).\n\n**Action:**\n\nReveal tile (5,1).\n\n**Move:**\n\n```\nMOVE: 5,1,false\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nRevealing (5,1) will help identify if there's a bomb adjacent to Tile (5,2), allowing for more accurate flag placement in subsequent moves.\n\n### **Final Considerations**\n\nAfter these moves, it's essential to reassess the board:\n\n1. **Check for any new conflicts or inconsistencies.**\n2. **Update the number of remaining flags and bombs accordingly.**\n3. **Look for tiles that can be safely revealed or flagged based on the new information.**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each numbered tile and ensuring that the number of adjacent flags matches the displayed number, I can minimize the risk of revealing a bomb. Additionally, removing incorrect flags and carefully placing new ones helps maintain the integrity of the game's rules.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**EXPLANATION:**  \nUpon identifying a conflict at Tile (0,3), which shows '1' but has two adjacent flags at (0,2) and (0,4), I determined that the flag at (0,4) is incorrect. Removing this flag resolves the inconsistency. Subsequently, to satisfy the '2' at Tile (1,3), I placed a flag at (1,4). These moves ensure that the adjacent bomb counts align with the numbered tiles, maintaining game consistency.\n\n**MOVE:**  \n```\nMOVE: 1,4,true\n```", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ F 1 F 1 . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 2 F 1 . . . .\n2 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 1 2 . . . . .\n4 _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 . . .\n5 _ _ 1 1 2 1 1 . . .\n6 _ _ 1 . 1 1 1 . . .\n7 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n8 1 1 1 . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

This means there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (0,3).  \n   - At (0,5), the number '1' has a flag at (0,4). This means there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (0,5).  \n   - At (1,3), the number '2' has a flag at (0,2). This means there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to (1,3).  \n\n2. **Identifying safe reveals**:  \n   - At (1,4), the square is unexplored and adjacent to (1,3), which requires exactly one more bomb. Since (1,3) already has one bomb flagged at (0,2), (1,4) must be safe to reveal.  \n   - At (2,4), the square is unexplored and adjacent to (1,3). Given the rules, it could be a bomb, but without more information, it\u2019s safer to reveal (1,4) first.  \n\n3. **Flag placement**:  \n   - No immediate obvious flag placements are required based on the current state.  \n\nEXPLANATION:  \nThe square at (1,4) must be safe to reveal because (1,3) requires exactly one more bomb, and the only unexplored adjacent squares are (1,4) and (2,4).
