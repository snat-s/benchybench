{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current state of the board. From what I can see, the entire board is unexplored\u2014everything is a dot, which means no squares have been revealed yet. The board size is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs placed. I have 10 flags remaining, which makes sense because each bomb should be flagged.\n\nSince no squares have been revealed yet, I don't have any numbers or flags to go by. That makes things a bit tricky. I remember that in Minesweeper, the goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs. Since I can't see any numbers, I don't have any clues about where the bombs might be. \n\nI'm thinking about the rules, especially the critical flag placement rules. Each number indicates exactly how many bombs are adjacent, so if I had a number, I could use that to deduce where bombs might be. But without any revealed numbers, I can't apply those rules yet. \n\nI also recall that the game ends if I reveal a bomb, so I have to be careful. Since I have 10 flags and 10 bombs, I need to place each flag correctly. But without any information, it's hard to decide where to place a flag. \n\nMaybe the best move right now is to start revealing some squares to get information. If I reveal a square and it's a number, that will give me clues about the surrounding areas. If I reveal a bomb, the game ends, but since I have no information, it's a risk I have to take.\n\nLooking at the board, all coordinates are possible. I think starting from the top-left corner might be a good idea because it's a common starting point, and maybe it's less likely to be a bomb. So, I'll choose (0,0) and decide whether to reveal it or place a flag.\n\nWait, but placing a flag without any information is risky. If I place a flag on a safe square, I'm wasting a flag. Plus, if I later find out that a number nearby requires a certain number of bombs, having a wrong flag could cause a conflict. So, it's better to reveal a square first to get some information.\n\nTherefore, I'll decide to reveal (0,0). If it's a number, I can start using that information to deduce other squares. If it's a bomb, well, the game ends, but that's the risk I have to take to get started.\n\nSo, the next move is to reveal (0,0). I'm not placing a flag yet because I don't have enough information to do so safely.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Since the board is completely unexplored, revealing a square is necessary to gain information. Starting from (0,0) is a logical first step to potentially uncover a number or a safe space without risking a flag placement prematurely.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 1, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs. I have 10 flags remaining, which means I can still flag all the bombs if needed. \n\nLooking at the board state, I see that some squares have been revealed, showing numbers and empty spaces. The top rows (0,1,2) have some numbers, like 1, 2, etc., which indicate adjacent bombs. I need to analyze these to decide where to place a flag or reveal a tile.\n\nFirst, I should check the revealed numbers to see if any conflicts exist with the current flags. But I don't see any flags placed yet, so that's not an issue. Next, I should look for obvious places where a bomb must be or where a number indicates a specific location for a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 0, columns 2 and 3 are revealed. At (0,2), it's a 1, meaning there's exactly one bomb in the surrounding 8 squares. The adjacent squares to (0,2) would be (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). From the board, (1,2) is a 1, which is also adjacent to (0,2). So maybe there's a bomb near there.\n\nIn row 2, at (2,2), it's a 2. That means there are two bombs around it. The surrounding squares include (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Some of these are already revealed, like (1,2) is a 1, so maybe the bombs are elsewhere.\n\nI also notice that in row 4, (4,0) is a 1, and (4,1) is a 2. So perhaps the bombs are near these squares.\n\nSince I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs, I need to find where to place them without conflicting with the numbers. Maybe I should look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, as they are more likely to be bombs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal some squares to get more information. For example, revealing a square that's adjacent to a 1 might show if it's a bomb or not. But if I reveal a square and it's a bomb, the game ends, so I have to be careful.\n\nLooking at (0,0) and (0,1), they are empty but unexplored. Maybe revealing one of these could help. But it's risky because they might be bombs. Alternatively, looking at (1,0) and (2,0), which are also empty but revealed. Wait, no, (2,0) is revealed as empty. So perhaps the bombs are not in the first column.\n\nWait, (4,0) is a 1, so there's a bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares would be (3,0), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1), (3,1). Since (4,1) is a 2, which is already revealed, maybe the bomb is in (5,0) or (3,0). But (3,0) is revealed as empty, so the bomb must be in (5,0) or (5,1). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a square that is surrounded by numbers that can only be satisfied by a bomb in that spot. For example, if a square is adjacent to two 1s, it must be a bomb. But I don't see such a case here.\n\nAnother approach is to count the number of bombs already accounted for. Each number tile indicates a certain number of bombs around it. For example, (0,2) is a 1, so one bomb is around it. (1,2) is a 1, so another bomb. (2,2) is a 2, so two bombs. (4,1) is a 2, so two bombs. (4,0) is a 1. So adding these up, but I'm not sure if they overlap.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the possible locations. Let's take (0,2) as a 1. The possible bombs around it could be in (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). But (1,2) is a 1, so that can't be a bomb because it's a number. So the bomb near (0,2) must be in one of the other squares. Similarly, (1,2) being a 1 means it has one bomb around it, which could be in (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). But (0,2) is a 1, so it's not a bomb, so the bomb must be elsewhere.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that is most likely to be a bomb based on the numbers. For example, if a square is adjacent to multiple 1s, it might be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that is adjacent to a 1, to see if it's a bomb. For example, revealing (0,1) because it's adjacent to (0,2) which is a 1. If (0,1) is a bomb, then (0,2)'s 1 is satisfied, but that would end the game. So that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that's less likely to be a bomb. For example, (5,5) is in the middle and hasn't been revealed yet. But that's just a guess.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the number of bombs remaining. There are 10 bombs in total, and none have been flagged yet, so all 10 are still hidden. So I need to find where they are.\n\nLooking back at the board, I see that (2,1) is a 1, so it has one bomb around it. The adjacent squares are (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). From the board, (1,2) is a 1, (2,0) is empty, (2,2) is a 2, (3,0) is empty, (3,1) is a 1, (3,2) is empty. So the bomb near (2,1) could be in (1,1), (1,0), (3,0), etc.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should pick a square that's adjacent to a 1 and see if it's a bomb. Let's say I reveal (0,1). If it's a bomb, game over. If not, maybe I get more info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere. But I don't have enough info yet. Maybe I should reveal a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, like (1,1). It's adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Since (0,2) is a 1, (1,2) is a 1, and (2,2) is a 2, maybe (1,1) is a bomb? Or maybe not. But if I reveal it and it's a bomb, the game ends. So maybe it's better to flag it.\n\nBut I don't know. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal (1,1). If it's a bomb, game over. If not, maybe it's a number that gives more info.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing (1,1) to see if it's a bomb or not. If it's a number, it can help me figure out where the bombs are. If it's a bomb, well, that's bad, but at least I tried.\n\nSo the move would be to reveal (1,1). Therefore, the move is (1,1) with flag=false.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Decided to reveal (1,1) to check for a bomb or a number, which could provide more information about adjacent bombs.\nMOVE: 1,1,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n2 _ 1 2 . . . . . . .\n3 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 1, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The player has 10 flags remaining, which means they haven't placed any flags yet. That's interesting because it gives me a clean slate to work with.\n\nLooking at the revealed numbers, I see that rows 0 to 4 have some numbers, while rows 5 to 9 are completely unexplored. The numbers in the top rows might give me some clues about where the bombs could be.\n\nStarting from the top, in row 0, columns 2 is a 1. That means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares of (0,2). The surrounding squares would be (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). But since row 0 is the top row, there's no row above it, so only those five squares are adjacent.\n\nIn row 1, column 2 is also a 1, so similar logic applies. The surrounding squares around (1,2) would include (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). But since (0,2) is a 1, maybe that influences things.\n\nMoving to row 2, column 1 is a 1 and column 2 is a 2. So (2,1) has one bomb around it, and (2,2) has two bombs around it. The numbers in row 4: (4,0) is a 1 and (4,1) is a 2. So, those might help in figuring out where the bombs are.\n\nI think I should start by looking for obvious places where a bomb must be. For example, if a number is 1 and all but one of its adjacent squares are revealed as safe, then the remaining square must be a bomb. But in this case, most of the numbers are in the top rows, and the squares around them are either unexplored or also numbers.\n\nWait, looking at row 0, column 2 is a 1. The squares around it are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). Since (0,1) and (0,3) are unexplored, and (1,2) is a 1, maybe that can help. If (1,2) is a 1, then it has exactly one bomb around it. The possible squares around (1,2) include (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). But (0,2) is a 1, so maybe the bomb for (0,2) is in a different square.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for a number that's in a corner or edge, as they have fewer adjacent squares, making it easier to deduce.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 0 is a 1. The surrounding squares would be (3,0), (4,1), and (5,0). Since (3,0) is unexplored, (4,1) is a 2, and (5,0) is unexplored. So the bomb adjacent to (4,0) must be in one of those three squares. But (4,1) is a 2, which means it has two bombs around it. So maybe (4,0)'s bomb is in (3,0) or (5,0). But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach is to look for numbers that are next to each other and see if their combined information can help. For example, (2,2) is a 2, and (2,1) is a 1. So, the square (2,1) has one bomb around it. The adjacent squares to (2,1) are (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), and (3,2). But (2,1) is a 1, so only one bomb is in those squares. Similarly, (2,2) is a 2, so two bombs are in its adjacent squares. Maybe the bomb for (2,1) is in (1,2), which is a 1, but that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, (1,2) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb around it. If (2,1) is a 1, maybe the bomb is in (1,1) or (3,1). But I'm not sure.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider that since no flags have been placed yet, the player is in the early stages. So, perhaps the best move is to reveal a square that's likely to be safe based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at the board, the bottom rows (5-9) are all unexplored. Maybe revealing a square in the bottom right corner, like (9,9), could be safe because it's far from the numbers. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, which could help in deducing more info. For example, (2,2) is a 2, and it's surrounded by several squares. If I reveal (2,3), which is currently a ., maybe it's a number that can help.\n\nBut wait, revealing a square could potentially hit a bomb, which would end the game. Since the player has 10 flags and 10 bombs, maybe it's better to start flagging possible bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLooking again at row 0, column 2 is a 1. The possible squares around it are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). Since (1,2) is a 1, maybe the bomb for (0,2) is in (1,3). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bomb is in (0,1). If I flag (0,1), would that conflict with any numbers? Let's see. If (0,1) is a bomb, then (0,2) would have a bomb adjacent, which is correct because (0,2) is a 1. Also, (1,1) is a 1, so if (0,1) is a bomb, then (1,1) would have one bomb, which fits because (1,1) is a 1. So flagging (0,1) might be a good move.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should check other possibilities. If (0,1) is a bomb, then (1,1) is a 1, which is correct. Also, (0,0) is unexplored. If (0,0) is revealed, it might show a number, but that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (0,1) to see if it's a bomb or not. If it's a bomb, the game ends, but if it's safe, I can get more info. But since I'm trying to avoid losing, maybe flagging is better.\n\nWait, but the player has 10 flags and 10 bombs, so each flag should be placed correctly. If I flag (0,1) as a bomb, I have to be sure. But I'm not entirely sure yet.\n\nAnother approach: look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers. For example, (1,1) is adjacent to (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Since (1,1) is a 1, and (0,2) is a 1, maybe (1,1) has a bomb in one of its adjacent squares.\n\nI'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should pick a square that's less likely to be a bomb. For example, (5,5) is in the middle of the unexplored area. Revealing that might give me a number which can help in the future.\n\nBut again, revealing could hit a bomb. Alternatively, maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to a number and see if it's possible to deduce if it's a bomb.\n\nWait, looking at row 4, column 1 is a 2. So, around (4,1), there are two bombs. The adjacent squares are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). But (4,0) is a 1, so that might help. Since (4,0) is a 1, it has one bomb around it. The possible bombs for (4,0) could be (3,0), (4,1), or (5,0). But (4,1) is a 2, so it has two bombs around it. So maybe (4,0)'s bomb is in (3,0) or (5,0), and (4,1) has two bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just make a move based on the least risky option. Since all the flags are remaining, perhaps revealing a square in the bottom right corner, like (9,9), is safer because it's far from the numbers. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should flag a square that's likely to be a bomb based on the numbers. For example, if (0,1) is a bomb, that would satisfy both (0,2) and (1,1) being 1s. So flagging (0,1) might be a good move.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's see, the total number of bombs is 10, and the player has 10 flags. So each flag must be correctly placed.\n\nAnother idea: look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, as they might be more likely to be bombs. For example, (1,2) is a 1, and (2,2) is a 2. The square (1,3) is adjacent to both. If (1,3) is a bomb, then (1,2) would have its one bomb, and (2,2) would have one of its two bombs accounted for. But I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nI think I've thought through as much as I can. I'll go with flagging (0,1) because it seems to fit the numbers around it.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (0,1) because it satisfies the adjacent 1s in (0,2) and (1,1), indicating it's likely a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 0,1,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n2 _ 1 2 . . . . . . .\n3 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 2, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the game info.\n\nThe board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 9 flags remaining, which means I can place up to 9 flags. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without revealing any.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares have been revealed, some are flagged, and most are still unexplored. Let me go through each row and note the important details.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- (0,0) is empty and revealed.\n- (0,1) is empty and revealed.\n- (0,2) is flagged as 'F'.\n- (0,3) shows a '1', meaning there's exactly one bomb in the adjacent squares.\n- The rest of row 0 is unexplored.\n\nRow 1:\n- (1,0) is empty and revealed.\n- (1,1) is empty and revealed.\n- (1,2) shows a '1'.\n- The rest is unexplored.\n\nRow 2:\n- (2,0) is empty and revealed.\n- (2,1) shows a '1'.\n- (2,2) shows a '2'.\n- The rest is unexplored.\n\nRow 3:\n- (3,0) is empty and revealed.\n- (3,1) shows a '1'.\n- (3,2) is empty and revealed.\n- The rest is unexplored.\n\nRow 4:\n- (4,0) shows a '1'.\n- (4,1) shows a '2'.\n- The rest is unexplored.\n\nRows 5 to 9 are all unexplored.\n\nNow, I need to analyze the revealed numbers and see if any flags are conflicting or if any new flags can be placed safely.\n\nFirst, let's check the existing flags. The only flagged square is at (0,2). Let me see if this flag is valid by checking the adjacent numbers.\n\nLooking at (0,2), which is flagged. The adjacent squares are:\n- (0,1): revealed as empty.\n- (0,3): shows '1'.\n- (1,1): revealed as empty.\n- (1,2): shows '1'.\n- (1,3): unexplored.\n\nSince (0,2) is flagged, the numbers around it should reflect that. For example, (0,3) is a '1', which means it should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (0,2) is a flag, that accounts for that '1'. So, (0,3)'s '1' is satisfied by the flag at (0,2). Therefore, the flag at (0,2) seems correct.\n\nNow, let's look for any obvious conflicts or places where numbers might indicate a bomb location.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- (0,3) is '1', which is satisfied by (0,2)'s flag.\n- So, no other bombs around (0,3).\n\nRow 1:\n- (1,2) is '1'. The adjacent squares are (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Since (0,2) is flagged, that's one bomb. So, (1,2)'s '1' is already satisfied by that flag. Therefore, no other bombs adjacent to (1,2).\n\nRow 2:\n- (2,1) is '1'. Adjacent squares include (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). (1,2) is '1', which is already accounted for by (0,2). So, (2,1)'s '1' must be another bomb. Wait, but (2,1) is '1', so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. But (0,2) is already a flag, which is adjacent to (1,2), not (2,1). So, (2,1)'s '1' must come from another bomb. That means there's another bomb adjacent to (2,1).\n\nLooking at (2,1)'s adjacent squares, let's see which could have a bomb. The possible squares are (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2). Since (2,2) is '2', it's not a bomb, so it must be a number. So the bomb must be in one of the other squares. Let's see which ones are revealed. (1,0) is empty, (1,1) is empty, (2,0) is empty, (3,0) is empty, (3,1) is '1', (3,2) is empty. So the only possible square is (3,1), which is '1'. Wait, but (3,1) is a '1', so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. If (3,1) is '1', then the bomb could be at (2,1), but (2,1) is '1', which is a number, not a bomb. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at (2,2), which is '2'. That means there are exactly two bombs adjacent to (2,2). The adjacent squares are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Let's see which of these could be bombs.\n\nWe know (0,2) is a flag, which is adjacent to (1,2), which is '1', so that's accounted for. So, for (2,2)'s '2', we need two bombs adjacent. Let's see which squares around (2,2) could be bombs.\n\nLooking at (1,1): empty, so not a bomb.\n(1,2): '1', so not a bomb.\n(1,3): unexplored.\n(2,1): '1', so not a bomb.\n(2,3): unexplored.\n(3,1): '1', not a bomb.\n(3,2): empty, not a bomb.\n(3,3): unexplored.\n\nSo, the possible bombs adjacent to (2,2) must be in (1,3), (2,3), or (3,3). But since (2,2) is '2', there must be two bombs among these. But I don't have any flags there yet, so maybe I can't determine that yet.\n\nLet me check row 3:\n- (3,1) is '1'. Its adjacent squares include (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). We know (2,1) is '1', so (3,1)'s '1' must come from another bomb. So, there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to (3,1). The possible squares are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (2,0), (2,2). But (2,2) is '2', so it's a number, not a bomb. (2,0) is empty, (4,0) is '1', (4,1) is '2', (4,2) is unexplored. So, the bomb must be in one of these. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 4:\n- (4,0) is '1', which means exactly one bomb adjacent.\n- (4,1) is '2', so two bombs adjacent.\n\nSo, (4,0) is '1', and its adjacent squares are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0) is empty, (3,1) is '1', (4,1) is '2', (5,0) and (5,1) are unexplored. So, the bomb adjacent to (4,0) must be in one of these. Since (3,1) is '1', it can't be a bomb, so the bomb must be in (5,0) or (5,1), but I can't tell yet.\n\n(4,1) is '2', so two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). We know (4,0) is '1', so maybe that's one bomb. Wait, (4,0) is a number, not a bomb. So, the two bombs must be among the other squares. (3,0) is empty, (3,1) is '1', (3,2) is empty, (4,2) is unexplored, (5,0), (5,1), (5,2) are unexplored. So, maybe two bombs in (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), or (4,2). But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, considering the number of flags left: 9. Since there are 10 bombs, I can place 9 flags, but I need to make sure I don't place a flag where a number would conflict.\n\nLooking back at the existing flag at (0,2), it seems correct because (0,3) is '1' and that's accounted for. So, I shouldn't remove it unless necessary.\n\nI think the next step is to look for a square where placing a flag would satisfy a number without causing conflicts. Alternatively, revealing a square that's likely safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,3) is '1', which is satisfied by (0,2)'s flag. So, the adjacent squares around (0,3) should have no other bombs. So, (0,4), (1,3), and (1,4) should be safe? Wait, no, because (0,3) is '1', so only one bomb adjacent, which is (0,2). So, (0,4), (1,3), and (1,4) should be safe to reveal, but I can't be sure because they might be adjacent to other bombs.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (2,2) which is '2'. If I can find two bombs adjacent to it, but I don't have enough info yet.\n\nAnother approach: look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which might help narrow down the bomb locations.\n\nFor example, (2,1) is '1', so it needs one bomb adjacent. The possible squares are (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2). Since (2,2) is '2', it's not a bomb. So, the bomb must be in (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), or (3,2). But (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), and (3,0) are all empty, so the bomb must be in (3,1) or (3,2). But (3,1) is '1', which is a number, not a bomb. So, the bomb must be at (3,2). Wait, (3,2) is empty, so that can't be. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, (3,1) is '1', so it can't be a bomb. So, the only other option is (3,2), which is empty. So, that suggests that there's no bomb adjacent to (2,1), which contradicts because (2,1) is '1'. That can't be right. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, maybe (2,1)'s '1' is satisfied by a bomb elsewhere. Let me re-examine. The adjacent squares to (2,1) are:\n- (1,0): empty\n- (1,1): empty\n- (1,2): '1'\n- (2,0): empty\n- (2,2): '2'\n- (3,0): empty\n- (3,1): '1'\n- (3,2): empty\n\nSo, none of these are bombs except possibly (1,2), but (1,2) is '1', not a bomb. So, where is the bomb that (2,1) is indicating? This is confusing. Maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet me check (3,1), which is '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n- (2,0): empty\n- (2,1): '1'\n- (2,2): '2'\n- (3,0): empty\n- (3,2): empty\n- (4,0): '1'\n- (4,1): '2'\n- (4,2): unexplored\n\nSo, (3,1) is '1', so it needs one bomb adjacent. The possible bombs could be in (4,0), (4,1), or (4,2). But (4,0) is '1', which is a number, not a bomb. So, the bomb must be in (4,1) or (4,2). But (4,1) is '2', which is a number, so the bomb must be in (4,2). Therefore, (4,2) must be a bomb because (3,1) is '1' and (4,2) is the only possible bomb adjacent.\n\nWait, but (4,1) is '2', which means it has two bombs adjacent. If (4,2) is a bomb, then (4,1) would have at least one bomb. But (4,1) is '2', so there must be another bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares to (4,1) are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). We thought (4,2) is a bomb, so that's one. The other bomb could be in (5,0), (5,1), or (5,2). But I can't confirm yet.\n\nIf (4,2) is a bomb, then (4,1) is '2' and has one bomb at (4,2), so it needs another bomb adjacent. That bomb could be in (5,1), for example.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me see if placing a flag at (4,2) would help. If I flag (4,2) as a bomb, does that cause any conflicts with other numbers?\n\nLooking at (3,1), which is '1', if (4,2) is a bomb, that satisfies (3,1)'s '1'. So that's good.\n\nLooking at (4,1), which is '2', if (4,2) is a bomb, then it needs another bomb adjacent. So, there must be another bomb in (5,1) or (5,2), but I can't confirm yet.\n\nNow, considering that I have 9 flags left and 10 bombs, I need to be careful where I place them.\n\nAnother approach: look for a square that is adjacent to a number which can only have one possible bomb location.\n\nFor example, (0,3) is '1', and the only possible bomb adjacent is (0,2), which is already flagged. So, all other adjacent squares to (0,3) must be safe. So, (0,4), (1,3), and (1,4) should be safe to reveal. But I'm not sure because they might be adjacent to other bombs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reveal a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, which can give more information.\n\nLooking at (2,2) which is '2', if I reveal (2,3), which is adjacent to (2,2), and see if it's a number or a bomb. But I don't know yet.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any of the revealed numbers are conflicting with the existing flag.\n\nFor example, (1,2) is '1', and it's adjacent to (0,2) which is a flag. So, that's fine. (2,1) is '1', but I'm not sure where the bomb is yet.\n\nI think the safest move might be to reveal a square that's adjacent to a '1' which is already satisfied by a flag, so that it must be safe.\n\nLooking at (0,3) is '1', and the only bomb adjacent is (0,2). So, the squares adjacent to (0,3) other than (0,2) must be safe. Therefore, (0,4), (1,3), and (1,4) should be safe to reveal.\n\nSo, perhaps I should reveal (0,4). If it's a number, that could help. If it's empty, that's also helpful.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should place a flag where a number indicates a bomb must be.\n\nWait, considering (3,1) is '1', and the only possible bomb adjacent is (4,2), as I thought earlier. So, maybe I should flag (4,2) as a bomb. But I can't be certain yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (4,2) to see if it's a bomb. But if it is, the game would end, which I don't want. So, perhaps it's better to flag it if I'm confident.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for another square where I can be more certain.\n\nLooking back at row 2, (2,2) is '2'. If I can find two bombs adjacent to it, that would help. But without more info, it's hard.\n\nAnother idea: since I have 9 flags left and 10 bombs, I can afford to place a flag somewhere, but I need to make sure it's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the square (3,2). It's empty, but maybe it's adjacent to a number that requires a bomb there.\n\nLooking at (3,2), which is empty. Its adjacent squares include (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). \n\n(2,1) is '1', (2,2) is '2', (3,1) is '1', (4,1) is '2'. So, if (3,2) is a bomb, then (2,1) would have two bombs adjacent (if (3,2) is a bomb and maybe another), but (2,1) is '1', which can't be. So, (3,2) can't be a bomb because it would make (2,1) have two bombs, which contradicts (2,1) being '1'. Therefore, (3,2) must be safe.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal (3,2). That might give me more info.\n\nBut wait, (3,2) is empty, so revealing it would show either empty or a number. If it's a number, it could help me find more bombs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (5,0), but that's too far and might not give useful info.\n\nWait, another idea: look at (4,0), which is '1'. Its adjacent squares include (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0) is empty, (3,1) is '1', (4,1) is '2', (5,0) and (5,1) are unexplored.\n\nSince (4,0) is '1', there must be exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares. The only possible bombs could be in (5,0) or (5,1). But I can't tell yet.\n\nI think I need to make a move that gives me the most information. Revealing (3,2) seems safe because it can't be a bomb, as that would conflict with (2,1)'s '1'. So, I'll reveal (3,2).\n\nIf (3,2) is empty, it might not help much, but if it's a number, it could indicate how many bombs are around it.\n\nSo, my next move would be to reveal (3,2).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (3,2) is safe because it cannot be a bomb without conflicting with adjacent numbers. This move provides information about potential adjacent bombs.\nMOVE: 3,2,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ F 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n2 _ 1 2 . . . . . . .\n3 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
