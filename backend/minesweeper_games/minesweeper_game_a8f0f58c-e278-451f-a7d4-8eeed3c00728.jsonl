In the entire board, we see that:\n   - At (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are all '1's, meaning each has a maximum of one adjacent bomb. \n\n2. The revealed numbers are clustered around the center:\n   - (2,2) is a '1' with no flags nearby.\n   - (3,2) is a '2'. This indicates there are two bombs in these adjacent squares:\n     - Which can only be located at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\n3. Upon reviewing the current flagged status, there are 10 flags available and examination of surrounding numbers indicates a high density of bombs around the tiles that reveal '2's, which means more flags may be required.\n\n4. (2, 2) is a number '1':\n   - It already has one adjacent flag at (1,2), hence we cannot place a bomb next to it. \n\n5.

This allows for the area to be revealed without fear. \n\nNext step:\n- We can reveal tile (4,4) which is guaranteed to be clear since the surrounding numbers contain no adjacent bombs.\n\nEXPLANATION: The tile at (4,4) is safe as it has a value of '0', indicating no adjacent bombs, allowing for a safe reveal.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n1 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 2 1 1\n2 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 . . 2 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 1 2 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1\n6 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n7 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n8 _ _ _ 1 2 . . . . .\n9 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

The number '1' in (0,5) indicates that it has one bomb in the adjacent squares. There's only one unexplored square at (1,5) next to it.\n2. The '1' at (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,6), and so on either have one flagged neighbor or are limited in potential flagged neighbors.\n3. We have already placed a total of **6 flags**. With **4 flags remaining** and **10 bombs total**, we need to be careful.\n\n### Conflicts:\n- The square at (1,0) has 1 adjacent empty square (which is (2,0)), thus that square could potentially be a bomb. Any additional flagged cells adjacent to (1,0) would contradict the current flag positioning.\n- The '2' at (1,6) implies that there should be 2 bombs adjacent to it. Currently, there's one bomb at (2,6), leading to a conflict as it would require another bomb adjacent.\n\n### Moves:\nSince there are no immediate conflicts demanding new flags, I will first reveal cell (1,5). This square was discussed earlier as being adjacent to (0,5) and is currently unexplored. \n\n### Decision:\nBy revealing (1,5), I keep tabs on the remaining flags and validate the current flag placements by uncovering any existing bombs if they lie beneath it.\n\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal the tile at (1,5) because it is adjacent to a '1' and providing necessary information on potential bombs in that area.\nMOVE: 1,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n1 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 2 1 1\n2 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 2 3 2 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 . 2 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 1 2 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1\n6 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n7 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n8 _ _ _ 1 2 . . . . .\n9 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
