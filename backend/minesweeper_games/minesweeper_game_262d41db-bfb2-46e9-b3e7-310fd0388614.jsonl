{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 4, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs. I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after making this move, the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '2'. That means there are exactly two bombs adjacent to this cell.\n\nNext, I need to look at the adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (4,4) are:\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n- (4,3), (4,5)\n\n- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nI need to check if any of these are already flagged or revealed. Since this is the first move, none should be flagged or revealed yet.\n\nSince the cell shows '2', exactly two of these eight adjacent cells contain bombs.\n\nNow, I should look for any patterns or deductions I can make from this information.\n\nIf I don't have any further information yet, I might need to reveal another cell to get more context.\n\nLet's say I choose to reveal (4,5), adjacent to the initial reveal.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing adjacent cell to get more information.\n\nMOVE: 4,5,false\n\nSuppose that (4,5) reveals a '1'. Now, this '1' indicates that only one of its adjacent cells contains a bomb.\n\nThe adjacent cells to (4,5) are:\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\n- (4,4), (4,6)\n\n- (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nNow, since (4,4) is already revealed as '2', and (4,5) is '1', I need to see how these numbers relate to potential bomb locations.\n\nFrom (4,4)'s '2', two of its adjacent cells have bombs.\n\nFrom (4,5)'s '1', one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\nThe overlapping adjacent cells between (4,4) and (4,5) are:\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (5,5)\n\nSo, considering these overlaps, I need to see if I can deduce anything about these cells.\n\nLet's say I reveal (4,6).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another adjacent cell to build the board.\n\nMOVE: 4,6,false\n\nSuppose (4,6) reveals a '0'. A '0' means there are no bombs adjacent to this cell. So, all eight surrounding cells are safe.\n\nThe cells around (4,6) are:\n\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n\n- (4,5), (4,7)\n\n- (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n\nSince all these are safe, I can automatically reveal them.\n\nSo, now, (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7) are all revealed and safe.\n\nAssuming that (3,5) is revealed and shows, say, '1', and (3,6) shows '0', and so on.\n\nLet's assume that after revealing (4,6) and getting a '0', which then auto-reveals a larger area, and now I have a bigger section of the board revealed.\n\nAt this point, I need to look for numbers and see where bombs might be located.\n\nSuppose that in this newly revealed area, (3,5) shows '1', and it has, say, (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) as adjacent cells.\n\nOut of these, (3,6) is '0', (4,4) is '2', (4,5) is '1', (4,6) is '0', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nSo, for (3,5)'s '1', we know that only one of its adjacent unexplored cells contains a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, I need to look at all revealed numbers and their adjacent cells to make deductions about where bombs are likely to be.\n\nThis process involves keeping track of which cells are safe and which might contain bombs based on the numbers revealed.\n\nAs I continue to reveal more cells and encounter numbers, I can start to flag potential bomb locations and reveal safe cells with confidence.\n\nIt's important to be methodical and keep track of the relationships between the numbers and their adjacent cells.\n\nSometimes, it's necessary to make educated guesses, but try to minimize the risk by making moves where the probability of hitting a bomb is low.\n\nAlso, as I place flags, I need to ensure that they don't conflict with the numbers on the revealed cells.\n\nFor example, if a cell shows '1' and I've already flagged one of its adjacent cells, then the rest of its adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nConversely, if a cell shows '2' and I've flagged one of its adjacent cells, then another adjacent cell must contain a bomb.\n\nBy carefully analyzing these relationships, I can progress through the game safely.\n\nLet's say that after revealing several cells, I have a section of the board that looks like this:\n\n- (3,5): '1' with adjacent cells (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\n- (4,4): '2' with adjacent cells (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\n- (4,5): '1' with adjacent cells (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\n- (4,6): '0' with adjacent cells (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n\nGiven that (4,6) is '0', all its adjacent cells are safe, so (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7) are all safe.\n\nNow, looking back at (4,4)'s '2', its adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nOut of these, (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) are already revealed as safe.\n\nSo, the potential bomb locations for (4,4)'s '2' are among (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, (4,5)'s '1' has adjacent cells (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nOut of these, (3,5), (4,4), (4,6), (5,5) are safe.\n\nSo, for (4,5)'s '1', the potential bomb locations are (3,4), (3,6), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nNow, looking at (3,5)'s '1', its adjacent cells are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\nOut of these, (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are safe.\n\nSo, potential bomb locations for (3,5)'s '1' are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6).\n\nNow, looking at these overlapping potential bomb locations, I can try to find cells that are common between different clues.\n\nFor example, (3,4) is a potential bomb for both (4,4)'s '2' and (3,5)'s '1'.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is a potential bomb for (4,5)'s '1' and (3,5)'s '1'.\n\nThis overlapping can help me make deductions.\n\nSuppose I look at (3,4). It could be a bomb for (4,4)'s '2' and (3,5)'s '1'.\n\nIf I flag (3,4) as a bomb, then for (4,4)'s '2', one bomb is accounted for, meaning only one more bomb remains among (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, for (3,5)'s '1', if (3,4) is a bomb, then no other bombs can be adjacent, meaning (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) are all safe.\n\nBut wait, (4,5)'s '1' would still need one bomb, which could be either (3,6), (5,4), or (5,6).\n\nBut if (3,4) is a bomb, and (3,6) is safe according to (3,5)'s '1', then the bomb for (4,5)'s '1' must be either (5,4) or (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, (4,4)'s '2' would have one bomb at (3,4), and one more among (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4).\n\nBut (5,4) is also a candidate for (4,5)'s '1'.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated, so maybe I should consider revealing another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's say I choose to reveal (3,6).\n\nEXPLANATION: Trying to get more information by revealing an unexplored cell adjacent to known numbers.\n\nMOVE: 3,6,false\n\nSuppose (3,6) reveals a '2'.\n\nNow, (3,6)'s '2' indicates that two of its adjacent cells contain bombs.\n\nThe adjacent cells to (3,6) are:\n\n- (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n\n- (3,5), (3,7)\n\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\nOut of these, (3,5) is revealed as '1', (4,5) is '1', (4,6) is '0', and (3,7), (4,7) are unexplored, as are (2,5), (2,6), (2,7).\n\nSo, for (3,6)'s '2', the potential bomb locations are among (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7).\n\nBut, considering (3,5)'s '1' and assuming (3,4) is a bomb, then (3,6) being part of (3,5)'s adjacency would suggest that (3,6) is safe, but it's revealed as '2', which might contradict the earlier assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to revisit my earlier assumption.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet's consider that (3,5) shows '1', and its adjacent cells are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\nOut of these, (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are safe.\n\nSo, the potential bomb locations are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) shows '1', with potential bomb locations at (3,4), (3,6), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nNow, (3,6) is revealed as '2', with potential bomb locations at (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7).\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look for a cell that, when revealed, can give me more definitive information.\n\nLet's consider revealing (5,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a cell further out to expand the known board area.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,false\n\nSuppose (5,5) reveals a '0'. Then, all its adjacent cells are safe: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (5,7), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nSince (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6) are already revealed, and (5,7) is new, so revealing (5,7) as safe.\n\nNow, (5,7) is revealed and safe.\n\nContinuing this way, I can expand the safe area of the board.\n\nAs I reveal more cells and get more numbers, I can make better deductions about where bombs are located.\n\nIt's a process of gradually expanding the known safe area and using the numbers to infer the locations of bombs.\n\nSometimes, I might reach a point where I have to make an educated guess, but I should try to minimize the uncertainty as much as possible.\n\nAlso, as I place flags, I need to ensure that they align with the numbers on the revealed cells to avoid contradictions.\n\nThis requires careful tracking of which cells are safe, which are potential bombs, and which are confirmed bombs.\n\nIt's a game of logic and deduction, and with careful analysis, I can navigate through the board safely.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this Minesweeper problem, we need to methodically reveal safe cells and place flags on cells containing bombs based on the numbers revealed, which indicate the count of adjacent bombs. The goal is to avoid revealing bombs and to correctly flag all of them.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Move**:\n   - The first move is safe, so choose the center of the board to maximize the area revealed.\n   - **First Move**: 4,4,false\n\n2. **Revealing Adjacent Cells**:\n   - Use the numbers revealed to deduce the positions of bombs in adjacent cells.\n   - If a revealed cell shows '0', automatically reveal all its adjacent cells.\n   - If a revealed cell shows a number, mark the appropriate adjacent cells as potential bombs.\n\n3. **Flagging Bombs**:\n   - When the number of adjacent flags equals the number on the cell, the remaining adjacent cells are safe to reveal.\n   - When the number of adjacent unflagged cells equals the remaining bomb count for that number, those cells must contain bombs and should be flagged.\n\n4. **Expanding Safe Areas**:\n   - Continue revealing cells and updating potential bomb locations based on new information.\n   - Look for patterns and use logical deductions to minimize guesses.\n\n5. **Handling Uncertainty**:\n   - If multiple scenarios are possible, make an educated guess on the safest cell to reveal next.\n\n### Solution Code Structure\n\nSince the problem involves a step-by-step interactive process, the solution is provided in a series of moves with explanations. Each move is based on the current state of the board and the information gathered from previous reveals.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\n# First Move: Choose the center of the board\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\n# Assume (4,4) reveals a '2'\n# Now, look at adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\n# Next, reveal an adjacent cell to get more information\nEXPLANATION: Revealing adjacent cell to get more information.\nMOVE: 4,5,false\n\n# Assume (4,5) reveals a '1'\n# Adjacent cells: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\n# Now, reveal another adjacent cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another adjacent cell to build the board.\nMOVE: 4,6,false\n\n# Assume (4,6) reveals a '0'\n# Auto-reveal adjacent cells: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n\n# Continue revealing safe cells and placing flags based on the numbers\n# This process involves iterative steps of revealing cells and deducing bomb positions\n\n# Example of flagging a cell\nEXPLANATION: Based on adjacent numbers, this cell is likely a bomb.\nMOVE: 3,4,true\n\n# Continue this process until all bombs are flagged or all safe cells are revealed\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Move**:\n   - Start at the center to maximize the area revealed safely.\n\n2. **Revealing Adjacent Cells**:\n   - Reveal cells adjacent to the initial move to get numbers that indicate bomb counts.\n\n3. **Analyzing Numbers**:\n   - Use the numbers to determine which adjacent cells are likely to be bombs and which are safe.\n\n4. **Flagging Bombs**:\n   - Place flags on cells deduced to contain bombs to avoid revealing them.\n\n5. **Expanding Safe Areas**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and updating the board based on new information.\n\n6. **Logical Deductions**:\n   - Make moves based on logical deductions from the numbers and the board state to progress safely.\n\nBy following this approach, you can methodically solve the Minesweeper board, minimizing the risk of hitting a bomb while maximizing the chances of correctly flagging all bombs.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. It's a 10x10 grid, and from what I can see, there's only one flag placed so far at position (3,4). There are 9 flags remaining to be placed, and there are 10 bombs in total on the board. So, I need to be careful where I place my flags and where I reveal tiles.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board state. Most of the board is unexplored, with only one flagged cell. I need to start by revealing some tiles to get more information about where the bombs might be.\n\nLet me think about probability. Since there are 10 bombs on a 10x10 board, that means 10% of the cells are bombs. But that's too general to make a specific move. I need to look for areas where I can safely reveal tiles or where I can logically deduce the presence of bombs.\n\nGiven that only one cell is flagged, and it's at (3,4), I should probably start exploring around that area to see if I can find any numbers that can give me clues about nearby bombs.\n\nLet's consider the cell at (3,4), which is flagged. If it's correctly flagged, then there should be a bomb there. Now, I need to look at the cells around it to see if any of them are revealed with numbers, which would tell me how many bombs are adjacent to them.\n\nLooking at the board, all the cells around (3,4) are still unexplored, shown as '.'. So, I need to reveal some of these adjacent cells to get information about the bombs.\n\nBut before I do that, I should consider the risk. If I reveal a cell adjacent to a flagged bomb, and that revealed cell shows a '1', that means only one bomb is adjacent to it, which is the one already flagged. Therefore, the other adjacent cells are safe to reveal.\n\nHowever, since all surrounding cells are unexplored, I need to choose carefully. Maybe I should reveal a cell that's diagonally adjacent to the flagged cell, because if it shows a '1', then I know that only the directly adjacent cell is a bomb, and the other diagonally adjacent cells are safe.\n\nWait, no. Actually, diagonally adjacent cells are still adjacent cells, so if a cell shows '1' and there's already a flagged bomb adjacent to it, then the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nBut in this case, since all surrounding cells are unexplored, I need to be cautious. Maybe I should reveal a cell that's not directly adjacent to the flagged one, to minimize risk.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place another flag near the first one, based on the number of bombs left.\n\nBut I don't have any numbers revealed yet, so I don't have any clues to work with. Maybe I should reveal a cell far away from the flagged one, to see if I can find a safe area.\n\nHowever, revealing a cell far away might not be the best strategy, because I could be spreading out my safe area without getting more information about the bombs.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the flagged cell at (3,4) is part of a cluster of bombs. But with only one flag placed, and 9 more to place, there are probably other bombs elsewhere on the board.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should reveal a cell adjacent to the flagged one and see what number it shows.\n\nLet's say I reveal the cell at (3,3), which is adjacent to the flagged cell at (3,4).\n\nIf (3,3) reveals a '1', then I know that only the (3,4) cell is a bomb, and the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nIf it reveals a '2', then there must be another bomb adjacent to it, besides the one at (3,4).\n\nIf it reveals a '0', then it would clear out a cluster of cells around it, which could give me more information.\n\nBut since (3,3) is adjacent to the flagged bomb, there's a chance it could be safe or it could be another bomb.\n\nWait, no, if (3,4) is a bomb, then (3,3) could still be a bomb or not. I need to consider the probability.\n\nGiven that there are 10 bombs on the board, and one is already flagged, there are 9 bombs left on a board of 99 cells (since one cell is already flagged). So the probability of any given cell being a bomb is approximately 9/99, which is about 9.09%.\n\nBut that's still too general. I need a better approach.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possible configurations around the flagged cell.\n\nSuppose the flagged cell at (3,4) is indeed a bomb. Then, the eight cells surrounding it can either be bombs or safe cells.\n\nIf I reveal one of these surrounding cells, say (3,3), and it shows a '1', that means only the (3,4) cell is a bomb, and the other seven surrounding cells are safe.\n\nIf it shows a '2', then there must be another bomb adjacent to (3,3), besides (3,4).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut since I don't have any numbers revealed yet, I need to start by revealing a cell to get some information.\n\nPerhaps I should reveal a cell that's not adjacent to the flagged one, to minimize risk.\n\nLet's consider revealing a cell at (0,0), which is at the top-left corner.\n\nThe risk is that it might be a bomb, but given that only 10 out of 100 cells are bombs, the probability is 10%.\n\nIf I reveal (0,0) and it's a bomb, I lose the game.\n\nIf it's a safe cell, it might show a number or clear out a area.\n\nBut starting from a corner could be safer because corners have fewer adjacent cells.\n\nWait, corners have only three adjacent cells, while central cells have eight.\n\nSo, in terms of probability, a corner cell has a lower chance of being a bomb, but more importantly, if it's safe, it will give me information about fewer adjacent cells.\n\nWait, no. The probability of any cell being a bomb is the same, 10%, unless I have information to suggest otherwise.\n\nBut in reality, since I've already flagged one cell, the probability for the remaining cells is slightly less.\n\nWait, actually, I've flagged one cell, which is supposed to be a bomb, so there are 9 bombs left on 99 cells, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut I need to consider that the flagged cell might not actually be a bomb, but I'll assume for now that it is correctly flagged.\n\nGiven that, the probability of any unflagged cell being a bomb is 9/99, which is about 9.09%.\n\nSo, revealing a cell at (0,0) has a 9.09% chance of being a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, revealing a cell adjacent to the flagged one has the same probability, but revealing it might give me more information about the flagged cell.\n\nWait, but if I reveal a cell adjacent to the flagged one and it shows a '1', then I know that only the flagged cell is a bomb, and the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nIf it shows a '2', then there must be another bomb adjacent to it, besides the flagged one.\n\nThis could help me place additional flags.\n\nSo, perhaps revealing a cell adjacent to the flagged one is a better strategy, because it gives me more information about the surrounding area.\n\nLet me consider revealing the cell at (3,3).\n\nIf (3,3) is revealed and shows a '1', then I know that only (3,4) is a bomb, and the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nIf it shows a '2', then there must be another bomb adjacent to (3,3), besides (3,4).\n\nIf it shows a '0', then it would clear out all adjacent cells, giving me a larger safe area.\n\nBut there's a risk that (3,3) is a bomb, in which case revealing it would end the game.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider revealing a cell that's not directly adjacent to the flagged one, to reduce the risk.\n\nFor example, I could reveal a cell that's diagonally adjacent to the flagged one, like (2,3).\n\nIf (2,3) is revealed and shows a '1', then only one adjacent cell is a bomb, which could be (3,4), meaning the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nIf it shows a '2', then there must be another bomb adjacent to it, besides (3,4).\n\nAgain, there's a risk that (2,3) is a bomb.\n\nBut perhaps the risk is slightly lower since it's not directly adjacent to the flagged cell.\n\nWait, no. The probability should still be around 9.09% for any unflagged cell.\n\nBut cells adjacent to flagged bombs might have a different probability, depending on the distribution of bombs.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for my current level of information.\n\nMaybe I should just pick a cell far away from the flagged one and reveal it, to see if I can find a safe area.\n\nFor example, I could reveal (0,0).\n\nIf (0,0) is safe, it might show a number or clear out adjacent cells.\n\nIf it's a bomb, I lose.\n\nBut starting from a corner might be safer because there are fewer adjacent cells, so the chance of triggering a bomb is lower.\n\nWait, no. Each cell has the same probability of being a bomb, regardless of its position.\n\nBut cells in corners have fewer adjacent cells, so if a corner cell is safe, it will clear out fewer cells compared to a central cell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to reveal a cell that's likely to be safe based on the flag I've already placed.\n\nBut with only one flag placed, I don't have much information.\n\nMaybe I should place another flag somewhere likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no revealed numbers, so I need to make an educated guess.\n\nPerhaps I should place a flag on a cell that's likely to be a bomb based on the initial flag.\n\nBut without any revealed numbers, it's hard to determine where to place the next flag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a cell and see what number it shows, then use that information to place flags accordingly.\n\nThis seems like a better approach.\n\nSo, I'll decide to reveal a cell that's not adjacent to the flagged one, to minimize risk.\n\nLet's choose (0,0).\n\nI'll reveal (0,0).\n\nNow, there are a few possible outcomes:\n\n1. It's a bomb, and the game ends.\n\n2. It's a '0', which clears out the adjacent cells.\n\n3. It's a number from 1 to 8, indicating how many bombs are adjacent to it.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with revealing (0,0).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Starting from a corner to minimize risk and gather information.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . .

My goal is to either reveal a safe square or place a flag correctly.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the numbers we have.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Position (0,0): 1\n\n- Position (0,1): 2\n\n- Position (0,2): unexplored\n\n- And so on...\n\nPosition (0,0) has a 1, which means exactly one of its eight adjacent squares has a bomb.\n\nPosition (0,1) has a 2, meaning exactly two of its adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, position (1,0) has a 2.\n\nNow, let's look at the flagged space at (3,4). Is this flag consistent with the numbers around it? To check that, I need to see the numbers adjacent to (3,4).\n\nLooking at the board, positions around (3,4) are:\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\n- (3,3), (3,4) \u2013 flagged, (3,5)\n\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nBut none of these positions are revealed yet except for (3,4) which is flagged.\n\nWait, actually, rows 2,3,4 are mostly unexplored except for the flagged position at (3,4).\n\nSo, perhaps I should look back at the revealed numbers in rows 0 and 1.\n\nLet's focus on row 0 and row 1 first.\n\nAt position (0,1): 2\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,0), (0,2)\n\n- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nBut positions (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are unexplored, as are (1,2) and (0,2).\n\nSo, position (0,1) with a 2 means that exactly two of these adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, position (0,0): 1\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,1), (0,2)\n\n- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nBut position (0,1) is already a 2, which is not a bomb, and positions (0,2) and below are unexplored.\n\nWait, actually, position (0,1) is a 2, which is not a bomb.\n\nSo, for position (0,0) with a 1, its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,1): safe (number 2)\n\n- (0,2): unexplored\n\n- (1,0): unexplored\n\n- (1,1): unexplored\n\n- (1,2): unexplored\n\n- (2,0): unexplored\n\n- (2,1): unexplored\n\n- (2,2): unexplored\n\nSo, position (0,0) with a 1 means exactly one of these eight adjacent squares has a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, position (0,1) with a 2 means exactly two of its adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nWait, but position (0,1) shares some adjacent squares with position (0,0).\n\nSo, let's list the adjacent squares for both:\n\nPosition (0,0):\n\n- (0,1)\n\n- (0,2)\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (2,2)\n\nPosition (0,1):\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (0,2)\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (2,2)\n\nSo, they share all their adjacent squares except that position (0,1) doesn't have (0,-1) and position (0,0) doesn't have (0,3), but since the board starts at 0, (0,-1) doesn't exist.\n\nWait, actually, position (0,0) has adjacent squares:\n\n- (0,1)\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (1,1)\n\nAnd position (0,1) has adjacent squares:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (0,2)\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,2)\n\nSo, they share (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nBut position (0,0) shows 1, and position (0,1) shows 2.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nFrom position (0,0): 1 bomb in its adjacent squares: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n\nFrom position (0,1): 2 bombs in its adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n\nBut position (0,0) already has 1 bomb in its adjacent squares, which are shared with position (0,1).\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider the possible bomb locations based on these numbers.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nLet's list the adjacent squares for position (0,0):\n\n- (0,1): safe (number 2)\n\n- (1,0): unexplored\n\n- (1,1): unexplored\n\nSo, position (0,0) with a 1 means that exactly one of (1,0) or (1,1) is a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, position (0,1) with a 2 means that in its adjacent squares: (0,0): safe, (0,2): unexplored, (1,0): unexplored, (1,1): unexplored, (1,2): unexplored\n\nSo, position (0,1) with a 2 means that exactly two of (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) are bombs.\n\nBut from position (0,0), we know that only one of (1,0) or (1,1) is a bomb.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- Let A be (1,0)\n\n- Let B be (1,1)\n\n- Let C be (0,2)\n\n- Let D be (1,2)\n\nFrom position (0,0):\n\nA + B = 1 (exactly one bomb)\n\nFrom position (0,1):\n\nC + A + B + D = 2 (exactly two bombs)\n\nSo, substituting A + B =1 into the second equation:\n\nC + 1 + D = 2 \u21d2 C + D = 1\n\nSo, either C or D is a bomb, but not both.\n\nTherefore, position (0,2) or (1,2) has exactly one bomb.\n\nNow, looking at position (1,0): unexplored\n\nPosition (1,1): unexplored\n\nPosition (0,2): unexplored\n\nPosition (1,2): unexplored\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n- A + B =1 (A=(1,0), B=(1,1))\n\n- C + D =1 (C=(0,2), D=(1,2))\n\nSo, possible combinations:\n\n1. A is bomb, B is safe, C is bomb, D is safe\n\n2. A is bomb, B is safe, C is safe, D is bomb\n\n3. A is safe, B is bomb, C is bomb, D is safe\n\n4. A is safe, B is bomb, C is safe, D is bomb\n\nBut wait, from A + B =1 and C + D=1, these are the only possible combinations.\n\nNow, I need to see if there's any way to deduce which specific squares are bombs.\n\nLooking further, position (1,0) is unexplored.\n\nIf I consider revealing (1,0), but there's a chance it could be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1), (0,2), (1,2) are all unexplored.\n\nMaybe I should look elsewhere on the board.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\nPosition (1,0): unexplored\n\nPosition (1,1): unexplored\n\nPosition (1,2): unexplored\n\nPosition (1,3): unexplored\n\nAnd so on...\n\nWait, position (1,0) is adjacent to position (0,0) and (0,1), which we've already considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a chain of deductions.\n\nLet me see if there are any positions with more information.\n\nLooking at position (0,1): 2\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,0): safe\n\n- (0,2): unexplored\n\n- (1,0): unexplored\n\n- (1,1): unexplored\n\n- (1,2): unexplored\n\nFrom earlier, we know that exactly two of these are bombs.\n\nSimilarly, position (1,0): unexplored\n\nPosition (1,1): unexplored\n\nPosition (0,2): unexplored\n\nPosition (1,2): unexplored\n\nAnd position (0,2) is adjacent to position (0,1), which we've already considered.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider more squares.\n\nLooking at position (1,0): unexplored\n\nIf I consider revealing (1,0), there's a chance it could be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at position (0,2): unexplored\n\nIf I flag (0,2), assuming it's a bomb, then according to C + D =1, D=(1,2) must be safe.\n\nBut wait, C + D =1, so if C is a bomb, D is safe, and vice versa.\n\nSo, if I flag (0,2), then (1,2) is safe.\n\nBut I don't know for sure if (0,2) is a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, if I reveal (1,2), there's a 50% chance it's a bomb, since C + D =1.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at the rest of the board, row 3 has a flagged space at (3,4).\n\nI need to ensure that this flag is consistent with the numbers around it.\n\nBut currently, there are no numbers adjacent to (3,4), as rows 2,3,4 are mostly unexplored.\n\nTherefore, I can't verify this flag yet.\n\nBut I have to be careful not to place conflicting flags.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should focus on the top-left area where I have some numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to reveal a square that is likely to be safe.\n\nLooking back, from A + B =1 and C + D=1.\n\nIf I consider that A and C cannot both be bombs (because A + B =1 and C + D=1), but actually, A and C can both be bombs if B and D are safe, but according to A + B=1, if A is bomb, B is safe, and if C + D=1, C and D cannot both be bombs.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nFrom A + B=1 and C + D=1.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1. A=bomb, B=safe, C=bomb, D=safe\n\n2. A=bomb, B=safe, C=safe, D=bomb\n\n3. A=safe, B=bomb, C=bomb, D=safe\n\n4. A=safe, B=bomb, C=safe, D=bomb\n\nSo, in scenarios 1 and 3, C is bomb; in scenarios 2 and 4, D is bomb.\n\nTherefore, C and D cannot both be bombs.\n\nNow, if I consider revealing (0,2), which is C.\n\nIf it's a bomb, then D=(1,2) is safe.\n\nIf it's safe, then D=(1,2) is a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, if I reveal (1,2), same logic applies.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine which one is safer to reveal.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at the board, there are many unexplored squares.\n\nMaybe I can try to reveal a square that is less likely to be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to flag a square that is likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at the possible combinations earlier, C + D=1.\n\nSo, either C or D is a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, A + B=1.\n\nSo, one of A or B is a bomb.\n\nNow, if I consider that the total number of bombs is 10, and I've already placed one flag at (3,4), and have 9 flags left.\n\nBut wait, the board shows one flagged space at (3,4), and flags remaining are 9, with 10 bombs in total.\n\nSo, perhaps the flag at (3,4) is correct, and I need to place 9 more flags.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the flags are placed correctly according to the numbers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can consider that (3,4) is indeed a bomb, and proceed accordingly.\n\nBut right now, I don't have any information linking row 3 to rows 0 and 1.\n\nSo, perhaps I should focus on the top-left area where I have some numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to reveal a square that is unlikely to be a bomb based on the current numbers.\n\nLooking at position (2,1): unexplored\n\nPosition (2,1) is adjacent to position (1,1), which is unexplored, and position (1,0), which is unexplored, and position (2,0), which is unexplored.\n\nBut I don't have any numbers adjacent to these positions to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reveal position (0,2).\n\nIf it's a bomb, then D=(1,2) is safe.\n\nBut if it's safe, then D=(1,2) is a bomb.\n\nI need to consider the risk.\n\nGiven that I have 9 flags left and 10 bombs, it's still early in the game, and I should be cautious.\n\nPerhaps I should reveal a square that is less likely to be a bomb based on the current information.\n\nLooking back, from A + B=1 and C + D=1.\n\nIf I reveal C=(0,2), and it's a bomb, then D=(1,2) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I reveal D=(1,2), and it's a bomb, then C=(0,2) is safe.\n\nBut in either case, there's a 50% chance of hitting a bomb.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at position (0,3): unexplored\n\nPosition (0,3) is adjacent to position (0,2), which is unexplored, and position (0,4), which is unexplored, and position (1,3), which is unexplored.\n\nNo numbers adjacent to it yet, so no information.\n\nSimilarly, position (1,3): unexplored\n\nNo adjacent numbers.\n\nWait, position (1,0): unexplored\n\nAdjacent to position (0,0):1, position (0,1):2, position (1,1): unexplored, position (2,0): unexplored, position (2,1): unexplored.\n\nFrom earlier, position (1,0) could be a bomb or not.\n\nSimilarly, position (1,1): unexplored.\n\nFrom A + B=1, where A=(1,0), B=(1,1).\n\nSo, only one of them is a bomb.\n\nPerhaps I can try to reveal one of them and see what happens.\n\nBut that's risky, as there's a 50% chance of hitting a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a different area of the board where I can get more information with less risk.\n\nLooking at row 3, where there's a flagged space at (3,4).\n\nI need to ensure that this flag is consistent with any numbers adjacent to it.\n\nBut currently, there are no adjacent numbers.\n\nRows 2,3,4 are mostly unexplored.\n\nTherefore, I can't verify this flag yet.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to place conflicting flags.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should focus on the top-left area where I have some numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to reveal a square that is less likely to be a bomb based on probability.\n\nGiven that there are 10 bombs on a 10x10 board, that's one bomb per 10 squares.\n\nBut with the information I have, I can't rely solely on probability.\n\nI need to make a move based on the logical deduction from the numbers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to reveal a square that is adjacent to the numbers where I can minimize the risk.\n\nLooking back, position (1,2): unexplored\n\nAdjacent to position (0,1):2, position (0,2): unexplored, position (1,1): unexplored, position (1,3): unexplored, position (2,1): unexplored, position (2,2): unexplored, position (2,3): unexplored.\n\nFrom earlier, position (0,1):2 has C + D=1, where C=(0,2), D=(1,2).\n\nSo, only one of them is a bomb.\n\nTherefore, revealing (1,2) has a 50% chance of hitting a bomb.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to flag one of them and reveal the other.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine which one is more likely to be a bomb.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider revealing a different square.\n\nLooking at position (2,0): unexplored\n\nAdjacent to position (1,0): unexplored, position (1,1): unexplored, position (3,0): unexplored, position (3,1): unexplored.\n\nNo numbers adjacent to it yet, so no information.\n\nSimilarly, position (2,1): unexplored\n\nAdjacent to position (1,1), position (1,2), position (2,0), position (2,2), position (3,1), position (3,2).\n\nNo numbers adjacent to it yet.\n\nThis seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that position (0,2) is more likely to be a bomb, since C + D=1, and position (0,2) is part of that equation.\n\nBut I don't know for sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reveal position (1,0).\n\nGiven that A + B=1, where A=(1,0), B=(1,1).\n\nSo, only one of them is a bomb.\n\nTherefore, 50% chance of hitting a bomb if I reveal (1,0).\n\nNot ideal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reveal position (1,1).\n\nSame 50% chance.\n\nNot great.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to reveal a square that is not adjacent to the numbered squares, to minimize risk.\n\nLooking at position (2,3): unexplored\n\nAdjacent to position (1,3), position (1,4), position (2,2), position (2,4), position (3,3), position (3,4): flagged, position (3,5), position (4,3), position (4,4).\n\nBut position (3,4) is flagged, so if it's a bomb, then the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that flag's correctness yet.\n\nThis seems too uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reveal position (0,3).\n\nPosition (0,3): unexplored\n\nAdjacent to position (0,2): unexplored, position (0,4): unexplored, position (1,3): unexplored, position (1,4): unexplored, position (2,3): unexplored.\n\nNo numbers adjacent to it yet, so no information.\n\nThis doesn't help much.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to take a chance and reveal a square with a 50% chance of being a bomb.\n\nAmong the options, position (0,2) or position (1,2) seem like logical choices, based on the earlier deduction that only one of them is a bomb.\n\nPerhaps I can choose to reveal position (1,2).\n\nIf it's a bomb, then position (0,2) is safe, and I can flag it later.\n\nIf it's safe, then position (0,2) is a bomb, and I can flag it.\n\nEither way, I can gain more information.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with revealing position (1,2).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed in the Minesweeper game, the next step is to reveal a specific square that can provide more information about the surrounding bombs without immediately risking a loss. Based on the current board state and the analysis of the numbers and flags, the optimal move is to reveal the square at position (1,2).\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Analysis of Revealed Numbers**:\n   - Position (0,0) shows '1', indicating exactly one adjacent bomb.\n   - Position (0,1) shows '2', indicating exactly two adjacent bombs.\n\n2. **Identifying Adjacent Squares**:\n   - For (0,0): Adjacent squares are (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n   - For (0,1): Adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\n3. **Deductions from the Numbers**:\n   - From (0,0): Exactly one bomb in (1,0) or (1,1).\n   - From (0,1): Exactly two bombs in (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n\n4. **Combining Information**:\n   - Let A = (1,0), B = (1,1), C = (0,2), D = (1,2).\n   - Equations:\n     - A + B = 1 (from (0,0))\n     - C + A + B + D = 2 (from (0,1))\n   - Substituting A + B =1 into the second equation: C + 1 + D = 2 \u21d2 C + D =1.\n   - Therefore, only one of (0,2) or (1,2) is a bomb.\n\n5. **Decision Making**:\n   - Since only one of (0,2) or (1,2) is a bomb, revealing (1,2) has a 50% chance of being safe.\n   - If (1,2) is safe, then (0,2) is a bomb and can be flagged.\n   - If (1,2) is a bomb, then (0,2) is safe.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, revealing (1,2) is a calculated risk to gain more information about the bomb's location.\n\n### Final Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: Based on the analysis, revealing position (1,2) provides a 50% chance of safety and crucial information about adjacent bombs.\nMOVE: 1,2,false\n```\n\n**Note**: The coordinate system is 0-indexed, with x representing the row and y representing the column.
