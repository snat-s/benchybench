Looking at tile (8,1) which is '2', we see it has two flags directly above it at (9,0) and (9,1). This satisfies the requirement for that '2', and no more flags should be placed around it. Another interesting position is (9,8) which shows '1' and has one uncovered adjacent tile at (8,8); this likely contains a bomb. However, (8,8) is where we don't want to flag right away, given that current bombs reported is 2 and both the flags at (9,0) and (9,1) should satisfy the ones required by the numeral '2'.\n\nOn the other hand, position (8,0) points to number '2', and indicates a possible need for another bomb being next to (7,0) and (7,1) including the flag placement provided previously. Since there is another '2' also above (7,1) and (6,0), confirming there is not enough evidence from all covering numbers checked prior, the second unknown location would be one that could contain a possible bomb.\n\nThus, exploring safe openings is the best move right now for confirmation on where bombs also reside. Revise positions surrounding open spaces shallow to eventually affirm those positions. Tile (1,7) is an open location per the reference guide that is surrounded by several others marked already, suggesting a possible safe reveal as the counts line primarily with the counts of existing numbers either open, marked, or flagged by bounds from side up. \n\nMOVE: 1,7,false", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 1 2 .\n1 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n2 . . 2 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n3 . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 . . 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . 2 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n7 . . 2 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n8 2 2 1 _ _ _ _ 1 2 .\n9 F F _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .", "sucess": false}
