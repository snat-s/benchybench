{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board. From the provided information, the board is a 10x10 grid, and all the squares are currently unexplored, represented by dots. There are 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs on the board. \n\nSince the board is completely unexplored, I don't have any numbers or flags to work with yet. That means I have to start by revealing a square. But which one? In Minesweeper, the best strategy is usually to reveal squares that are less likely to be bombs, but without any information, it's a bit of a gamble.\n\nI remember that in the beginning, people often click the center squares because they have fewer adjacent squares, which can reduce the risk of hitting a bomb. Alternatively, sometimes the corners are safer because they have fewer adjacent squares, but I'm not sure if that's a real strategy or just a myth.\n\nLet me think about the probabilities. Each square has an equal chance of being a bomb since the board is empty. There are 100 squares and 10 bombs, so each square has a 10% chance of being a bomb. But if I reveal a square, the chance that it's a bomb is 10%, which is pretty high. However, if I place a flag, I can reduce the number of possible bombs, but since I don't have any information, placing a flag might not be useful yet.\n\nWait, but the problem says I need to provide a move, either revealing a square or placing a flag. Since all squares are unexplored, I can't place a flag without any information. So, I have to reveal a square.\n\nNow, considering the coordinate system, I should choose a square that's in a position that might give me the most information. Maybe starting near the center could help because it has more adjacent squares, which might reveal numbers that can help me deduce where the bombs are.\n\nAlternatively, I could start at a corner, like (0,0), but that might be riskier because if it's a bomb, I lose immediately. So, maybe a safer approach is to choose a square that's a bit more central but not too central, so I can get some information without risking too much.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves. If I reveal (4,4), that's the exact center. If that's a bomb, I lose, but if it's safe, it might give me a number that can help me figure out the surrounding squares. But since I don't have any information, it's a 10% chance of losing. Alternatively, maybe I can choose a square that's slightly off-center, like (5,5), but it's still a similar risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start near the edge but not at the corner. For example, (0,5) is in the top row, middle column. If I reveal that, if it's a bomb, I lose, but if it's safe, it might show a number that can help me figure out the surrounding squares.\n\nWait, but without any information, revealing any square is equally risky. So, maybe I should just choose a square in the middle, like (4,4), to maximize the potential information I get. If it's a number, I can then use that to figure out where the bombs are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start at (0,0) to get some information about the top-left corner. But again, it's a 10% chance of being a bomb.\n\nHmm, I think the best approach is to choose a square that's in a position where, if it's a number, it can help me figure out the surrounding squares. So, maybe (4,4) is a good starting point because it's in the center and has the maximum number of adjacent squares, which could give me a higher number, indicating more bombs around it, which might help me place flags later.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with revealing (4,4). If it's a bomb, I lose, but if it's a number, I can use that information to deduce where the bombs are.\n</think>\n\nThe board is completely unexplored, so I need to make an initial move by revealing a square. Choosing (4,4) in the center maximizes the potential information from adjacent squares.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 9, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let's start by looking at the board state provided. It's a 10x10 grid, and I have 10 flags left, with 10 bombs in total. My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without detonating any.\n\nFirst, I'll try to analyze the board. Let me visualize it row by row.\n\nLooking at row 3, I see some numbers: 1, 2, ., 1, 1, ., ., ., ., .. So positions (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 2, (3,3) is 1, (3,4) is 1, and the rest are dots (unexplored).\n\nRow 4 has more numbers: _, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, ., ., ., .. So (4,0) is empty (revealed), (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1, (4,3) is 1, (4,4) is 1, (4,5) is 2, and the rest are dots.\n\nRow 5 has several underscores and some 1s: _, _, _, _, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. So (5,4) to (5,9) are 1s, but the first four are empty.\n\nRow 6: _, _, _, _, 1, ., 1, _, _, .. So (6,4) is 1, (6,6) is 1.\n\nRow 7: _, _, _, _, 1, 1, 1, _, _, .. So (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are 1s.\n\nRow 8: 1, 1, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, .. So (8,0) and (8,1) are 1s.\n\nRow 9: ., 1, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, .. So (9,1) is 1.\n\nHmm, okay. I need to look for areas where the numbers can give me clues about where the bombs are or where they aren't.\n\nLet's start with row 3. At (3,0), there's a 1. Since it's a 1, there should be exactly one bomb in the adjacent 8 squares. But looking around (3,0), the adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1), (3,-1 which is invalid), (2,-1 invalid), (4,-1 invalid). Wait, but (3,0) is on the edge, so some squares don't exist. So the adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). Now, in (3,1), it's a 2, which is a number, so it's safe. Similarly, (4,0) is empty, (4,1) is 1, (2,0) is empty, (2,1) is empty. So the only possible squares that could have bombs are (3,1) which is a number, so it's safe, (4,0) is empty, so maybe (4,1) is adjacent to a bomb. Wait, (4,1) is a 1, so it's a number, so it's safe. So the only possible bomb is in (3,1), but that's a number, so it can't be a bomb. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. (3,0) is 1, meaning one of its adjacent squares has a bomb. The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). But (3,1) is a 2, which is a number, so it's safe. So the bomb must be in one of the other squares: (2,0), (2,1), (4,0), or (4,1). But (4,0) is empty, so it's a revealed safe square, so it can't have a bomb. (4,1) is 1, which is a number, so it's safe. So the bomb must be in either (2,0) or (2,1). But (2,0) and (2,1) are both dots, meaning unexplored. So I can't be certain yet.\n\nLet me move to row 4. At (4,5), there's a 2. So it has two bombs in adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). Let's check these:\n\n(3,4) is 1, (3,5) is ., (3,6) is ., (4,4) is 1, (4,6) is ., (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is 1. So the possible bombs are in (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). But (5,6) is a 1, which is a number, so it's safe. So bombs must be in (3,5), (3,6), or (4,6). But I don't have enough info yet.\n\nLooking at row 5, (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is 1, (5,7) is 1, (5,8) is 1, (5,9) is 1. So each of these has exactly one bomb adjacent. Let's take (5,4)=1. Its adjacent squares are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Checking these:\n\n(4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=2, (5,3)=1, (5,5)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=., (6,5)=1.\n\nSo for (5,4)=1, only one of these can have a bomb. But it's tricky.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for areas where the numbers are already satisfied, meaning the bombs are known, so I can deduce others.\n\nLooking at row 6, (6,4)=1. Its adjacent squares are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). Among these, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,5)=1, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=1. So (6,4)=1 has only one bomb adjacent. But since all these are numbers, maybe I can find where the bomb is.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a number that has all its required bombs already flagged or revealed. For example, if a 2 has two flags around it, then the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nLooking at (4,5)=2. Its adjacent squares are (3,4)=1, (3,5)=., (3,6)=., (4,4)=1, (4,6)=., (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1. So the bombs must be in (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). But (5,6)=1 is a number, so it's safe. So bombs are in (3,5), (3,6), (4,6). Since (4,5)=2 needs two bombs, so two of these three must be bombs.\n\nBut I don't have enough info yet. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 5, (5,4)=1. Its adjacent squares are (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=2, (5,3)=1, (5,5)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1. So one of these must have a bomb. But it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 8. (8,0)=1 and (8,1)=1. Their adjacent squares include (7,0), (7,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1). But (8,2) is _, so unexplored. (9,1)=1, which is a number. So for (8,0)=1, the bomb must be in one of (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1). But (8,1) is a 1, so it's safe. (9,1)=1 is a number, so safe. So the bomb must be in (7,0), (7,1), or (9,0). But (7,0)=_, (7,1)=_. (9,0)=., which is unexplored. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the bottom right area. Row 9, (9,1)=1. Its adjacent squares are (8,0)=1, (8,1)=1, (8,2)=_, (9,0)=., (9,2)=_, (10,0) invalid, etc. So the bomb for (9,1)=1 must be in (8,0), (8,1), (9,0), or (8,2). But (8,0) and (8,1) are numbers, so they can't be bombs. So the bomb must be in (9,0) or (8,2). So maybe I can flag (9,0) or (8,2) as bombs.\n\nWait, but (9,0) is a dot, so unexplored. If I flag (9,0), that would satisfy (9,1)=1. Alternatively, (8,2)=_, which is unexplored. But I don't know yet.\n\nWait, let's go back to row 3. (3,1)=2. It has two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0)=1, (3,2)=., (4,0)=_, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. So the bombs must be in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), or (4,0), (4,2). But (4,0)=_ is empty, so it's safe, so bombs must be in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). But (2,0)=., (2,1)=., (2,2)=.. So I can't be sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a number that has all its adjacent squares either flagged or known. Let's see.\n\nLooking at (5,9)=1. Its adjacent squares are (4,8)=., (4,9)=., (5,8)=., (6,8)=_, (6,9)=_, (7,8)=_, (7,9)=_, (6,10) invalid. So only (6,8) and (6,9) are in row 6, which is (6,8)=_, (6,9)=_. So the bomb must be in one of these two. But since (5,9)=1, only one of them is a bomb. But I don't know which.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (5,5)=1. Its adjacent squares are (4,4)=1, (4,5)=2, (4,6)=., (5,4)=1, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=.. So the bomb must be in one of these. But since (4,5)=2 needs two bombs, and (5,5)=1 needs one, maybe overlapping.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a number that has all adjacent squares accounted for except one.\n\nLooking at (4,5)=2. It needs two bombs. The adjacent squares are (3,4)=1, (3,5)=., (3,6)=., (4,4)=1, (4,6)=., (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1. So the bombs must be in (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). But (5,6)=1 is a number, so it's safe. So bombs are in (3,5), (3,6), (4,6). But (4,5)=2 needs two bombs, so two of these must be bombs.\n\nLooking at (3,5)=., (3,6)=., (4,6)=.. So I can't be certain yet.\n\nWait, maybe looking at row 5, (5,4)=1. Its adjacent squares are (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=2, (5,3)=1, (5,5)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1. So the bomb must be in one of these. But since all these are numbers, the bomb must be in one of the adjacent squares that are unexplored. Wait, no, the bomb is in one of the adjacent squares. But since all adjacent squares except (6,3) are numbers, but (6,3)=1 is a number, so it's safe. So the bomb must be in (5,3), (5,5), (5,6), etc. Wait, no, (5,4)=1's adjacent squares are the ones I listed. Since (5,4)=1 needs one bomb, and all the adjacent squares except (4,3), (4,4), etc., are numbers, so maybe the bomb is in (6,3)=1, but that's a number, so it can't be a bomb. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a spot where the numbers indicate that a particular square must be a bomb or must be safe.\n\nLooking at row 8, (8,0)=1 and (8,1)=1. Let's consider (8,0)=1. Its adjacent squares are (7,0)=_, (7,1)=_, (8,1)=1, (9,0)=., (9,1)=1. So the bomb must be in (7,0), (7,1), (9,0). Since (8,1)=1 is a number, it's safe. So the bomb is in (7,0), (7,1), or (9,0). Similarly, (8,1)=1 has adjacent squares (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0)=1, (8,2)=_, (9,0)=., (9,1)=1, (9,2)=_. So the bomb must be in (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (9,0), (9,2). But since (8,0)=1 and (8,1)=1 both point to (7,0) and (7,1), maybe those are the bombs.\n\nWait, if (8,0)=1 and (8,1)=1 both have their bombs in (7,0) and (7,1), that would satisfy both. Because (8,0)=1 needs one bomb, and (8,1)=1 also needs one bomb. So if (7,0) is a bomb, that would satisfy (8,0)=1. Similarly, if (7,1) is a bomb, that would satisfy (8,1)=1. But wait, (8,0)=1 can have the bomb in (7,0) or (7,1), and (8,1)=1 can have the bomb in (7,0), (7,1), or (9,0). So maybe (7,0) and (7,1) are bombs. But I can't be sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (9,0) is a bomb, but that would satisfy both (8,0)=1 and (8,1)=1? No, because (8,0)=1 would have (9,0) as a bomb, and (8,1)=1 would also have (9,0) as a bomb. But that would mean both numbers are satisfied by one bomb, which is possible. But then (8,0)=1 would have only one bomb, which is correct, and (8,1)=1 would also have that same bomb. But wait, (8,0)=1 is at (8,0), so its adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1). If (9,0) is a bomb, then (8,0)=1 is satisfied, and (8,1)=1 would also be satisfied if (9,0) is a bomb. But that would mean both numbers are satisfied by the same bomb, which is possible. So maybe (9,0) is a bomb.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe (7,0) and (7,1) are bombs. If I flag both, that would satisfy both (8,0)=1 and (8,1)=1. But I don't have enough info yet.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a spot where the numbers indicate that a particular square must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 5, (5,9)=1. Its adjacent squares are (4,8)=., (4,9)=., (5,8)=., (6,8)=_, (6,9)=_, (7,8)=_, (7,9)=_, (6,10) invalid. So the bomb must be in (6,8) or (6,9). But since (5,9)=1 needs one bomb, so either (6,8) or (6,9) is a bomb.\n\nWait, but (6,8)=_ is empty, so it's safe. Wait, no, (6,8)=_ is empty, so it's a safe square, meaning no bomb. So the bomb must be in (6,9)=_. So I can flag (6,9) as a bomb.\n\nWait, because (5,9)=1 needs one bomb, and the only possible square is (6,9), since (6,8)=_ is empty. So (6,9) must be a bomb. So I can flag (6,9) as a bomb.\n\nWait, let me confirm. (5,9)=1's adjacent squares are (4,8)=., (4,9)=., (5,8)=., (6,8)=_, (6,9)=_, (7,8)=_, (7,9)=_, (6,10) invalid. So the only revealed squares are (6,8)=_, which is safe, so the bomb must be in (6,9)=_. So yes, (6,9) must be a bomb. So I can flag (6,9).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should flag (6,9) as a bomb.\n\nWait, but I have 10 flags left, and 10 bombs, so if I flag (6,9), that's one flag used. But I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reveal a square that's definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 6, (6,6)=1. Its adjacent squares are (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,7)=., (7,5)=1, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=.. So the bomb must be in one of these. But since (6,6)=1 needs one bomb, and most of these are numbers, the bomb must be in one of the unexplored squares. Wait, (6,7)=., (7,7)=., (5,7)=1, which is a number, so safe. So the bomb must be in (6,7) or (7,7). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe looking at row 7, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=1, (7,6)=1. So (7,4)=1 needs one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (7,3)=1, (7,5)=1, (8,3)=_, (8,4)=_, (8,5)=1. So the bomb must be in one of the unexplored squares. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a spot where a number has all its adjacent bombs accounted for except one, which would be a safe spot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at row 3, (3,1)=2. It needs two bombs. The adjacent squares are (2,0)=., (2,1)=., (2,2)=., (3,0)=1, (3,2)=., (4,0)=_, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. So the bombs must be in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (4,0), (4,2). But (4,0)=_ is empty, so it's safe. So bombs must be in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), or (4,2)=1, which is a number, so it's safe. So bombs must be in (2,0), (2,1), or (2,2). But I don't know which.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at row 4, (4,5)=2. It needs two bombs. The adjacent squares are (3,4)=1, (3,5)=., (3,6)=., (4,4)=1, (4,6)=., (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1. So the bombs must be in (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), or (5,6)=1, which is safe. So two bombs must be in (3,5), (3,6), (4,6). But I don't know which.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at row 6, (6,4)=1. Its adjacent squares are (5,3)=1, (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,5)=1, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=1. So the bomb must be in one of these. But since all are numbers, maybe the bomb is in (7,3)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a spot where a number has all its bombs accounted for except one, making the remaining square a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at row 3, (3,3)=1. Its adjacent squares are (2,2)=., (2,3)=., (2,4)=., (3,2)=., (3,4)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1. So the bomb must be in (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), or (3,2), (4,2)=1 is safe. So the bomb must be in (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), or (3,2). But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, (5,9)=1. Its adjacent squares are (4,8)=., (4,9)=., (5,8)=., (6,8)=_, (6,9)=_, (7,8)=_, (7,9)=_, (6,10) invalid. So the bomb must be in (6,9)=_. So I can flag (6,9)=_ as a bomb.\n\nYes, that seems like a solid deduction. So I can place a flag at (6,9). That would satisfy (5,9)=1, as it's adjacent to (6,9). So I'll flag (6,9).\n\nWait, but wait. (5,9)=1's adjacent squares include (6,9)=_, which is unexplored. So if I flag (6,9), that would satisfy the 1. But I need to make sure that (6,9) is indeed a bomb. Let me check the numbers around it.\n\nLooking at (6,9)=_, which is adjacent to (5,8)=., (5,9)=1, (6,8)=_, (7,8)=_, (7,9)=_. So if (6,9) is a bomb, it would affect (5,8)=., (5,9)=1, (6,8)=_, (7,8)=_, (7,9)=_. But (5,9)=1 would be satisfied by (6,9) being a bomb. So that seems correct.\n\nSo I think flagging (6,9) is a safe move. So my move would be to place a flag at (6,9).\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other numbers that would be affected by this flag. For example, (5,8)=., which is adjacent to (5,9)=1, (6,8)=_, (6,9)=flagged. So if (6,9) is a bomb, then (5,8)=. would have that bomb adjacent, but (5,8)=. is unexplored, so it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should flag (6,9) as a bomb, which would satisfy (5,9)=1.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So I'll place a flag at (6,9).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (5,9) shows a '1', indicating exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares.

The rules say that each number shows exactly how many bombs are adjacent, so I need to make sure that the flags I place don't conflict with these numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0 (3,0) has a '1'. That means it has exactly one bomb adjacent. Let me check its neighbors. The adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1), and (3,-1) which is out of bounds. Wait, (3,-1) doesn't exist, so the neighbors are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). Among these, (4,0) is '_', which is empty, (4,1) is '1', which is a number, so it's safe. (3,1) is '2', which is also a number. (2,0) and (2,1) are '.' so unexplored. So the only possible bombs are in (4,0) or (4,1). But (4,1) is a '1', which is a number, so it's safe. So the bomb must be at (4,0). But wait, (4,0) is '_', which means it's revealed as empty. So that's a problem because the '1' at (3,0) expects one adjacent bomb, but (4,0) is empty. So maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. Let me check the board again. At row 3, column 0 is '1'. Its adjacent squares are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). So if (4,0) is '_', that's empty, and (4,1) is '1', which is a number, so it's safe. So the only possible bomb is in (3,1), but (3,1) is '2', which is a number, so it's safe. Hmm, that's confusing because the '1' at (3,0) must have one bomb adjacent, but I don't see any flags or bombs around it. Maybe I need to flag one of the unexplored squares.\n\nWait, but (4,0) is '_', which is empty, so it can't be a bomb. So perhaps the bomb is at (3,1), but that's a '2', which is a number, so it's safe. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the board. Let me check row 4. Row 4 has positions: (4,0) is '_', (4,1) is '1', (4,2) is '1', (4,3) is '1', (4,4) is '1', (4,5) is '2', and the rest are '.'.\n\nWait, so at (3,0) '1', the adjacent squares are (2,0) '.', (2,1) '.', (3,1) '2', (4,0) '_', (4,1) '1'. So (3,1) is '2', which is a number, so it's safe. (4,1) is '1', which is a number, so it's safe. (4,0) is '_', which is empty. So the only possible bomb is in (2,0) or (2,1). But (2,0) is '.', and (2,1) is '.'. So maybe I need to flag one of these.\n\nBut wait, the '1' at (3,0) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (4,0) is empty, the bomb must be either at (2,0) or (2,1). Let me check if either of these is a bomb. But I don't have any flags there yet. So perhaps I should flag one of them. But which one?\n\nLooking at row 2, column 0 is '.', and column 1 is '.'. Let me check if any other numbers around these positions can help me. For example, the '2' at (3,1) has neighbors: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). The '2' at (3,1) needs two bombs adjacent. We already have the '1' at (3,0) expecting one bomb. So perhaps the bomb is at (2,1). If I flag (2,1), that would satisfy the '1' at (3,0) and also contribute to the '2' at (3,1). Let me see.\n\nIf I flag (2,1), then the '1' at (3,0) would have one flag, satisfying its count. The '2' at (3,1) would then need one more bomb. Let me see where else could be a bomb. The '2' at (3,1) is adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). If (2,1) is flagged, then (3,1)'s count is 1, so it needs another bomb. Let's see, (2,0) is '.', (2,2) is '.', (3,2) is '.', (4,0) is '_', (4,1) is '1', (4,2) is '1'. So perhaps (4,2) is a bomb? But (4,2) is '1', which is a number, so it's safe. So maybe (2,2) is a bomb? But (3,1) is '2', so if (2,1) is a bomb, then (2,2) would be another bomb. But (2,2) is '.', so I don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bomb is at (2,0). Let's see. If I flag (2,0), then the '1' at (3,0) is satisfied. The '2' at (3,1) would then have one bomb at (2,0), so it needs another. Looking at the neighbors of (3,1), the other possible bombs could be at (2,1) or (2,2). But I don't have any information about those yet.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should look elsewhere for a more straightforward deduction.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5 (5,5) is '1'. Its neighbors are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Among these, (4,4) is '1', (4,5) is '2', (4,6) is '.', (5,4) is '1', (5,6) is '1', (6,4) is '1', (6,5) is '1', (6,6) is '.'. So the '1' at (5,5) needs exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares. Let's see if any are already flagged or revealed.\n\n(4,4) is '1', which is a number, so safe. (4,5) is '2', safe. (4,6) is '.', unexplored. (5,4) is '1', safe. (5,6) is '1', safe. (6,4) is '1', safe. (6,5) is '1', safe. (6,6) is '.', unexplored. So the only possible bombs are at (4,6) or (6,6). But (5,5) is '1', so only one of these can be a bomb. Maybe I can flag one of them, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me check other numbers. At row 4, column 5 (4,5) is '2'. Its neighbors are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). Among these, (3,4) is '.', (3,5) is '.', (3,6) is '.', (4,4) is '1', (4,6) is '.', (5,4) is '1', (5,5) is '1', (5,6) is '1'. So the '2' at (4,5) needs two bombs adjacent. The possible candidates are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). But (5,4) is '1', which is safe, (5,5) is '1', safe, (5,6) is '1', safe. So the bombs must be among (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), or (4,6). But I don't have any flags there yet.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a number that has all its adjacent bombs accounted for except one, which would allow me to place a flag.\n\nLooking back at row 3, column 3 (3,3) is '1'. Its neighbors are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (3,2) is '.', (3,4) is '1', (4,2) is '1', (4,3) is '1', (4,4) is '1'. So the '1' at (3,3) needs one bomb. The possible bombs are in (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). But (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are all '1's, which are safe. So the bomb must be in (2,2), (2,3), or (2,4). Let me check if any of these are adjacent to other numbers that could help.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4 (2,4) is '.', but it's adjacent to (3,3) '1' and (3,4) '1'. If (2,4) is a bomb, it would satisfy both '1's, but I don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at row 6, column 6 (6,6) is 'F', which is a flag. So that's a bomb there. So the '1' at (5,5) is adjacent to (6,6) which is a bomb, so that satisfies the '1' at (5,5). So I can mark (6,6) as a bomb, which is already flagged.\n\nWait, but the flag at (6,6) is already placed, so that's one bomb accounted for. So the '1' at (5,5) is satisfied by (6,6). So that's good.\n\nNow, looking at row 6, column 5 (6,5) is '1'. Its neighbors are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,4) is '1', (5,5) is '1', (5,6) is '1', (6,4) is '1', (6,6) is 'F' (bomb), (7,4) is '1', (7,5) is '1', (7,6) is '.'. So the '1' at (6,5) has one bomb at (6,6), so it's satisfied. So no more bombs around it.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5 (4,5) is '2'. Its neighbors are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). (3,4) is '.', (3,5) is '.', (3,6) is '.', (4,4) is '1', (4,6) is '.', (5,4) is '1', (5,5) is '1', (5,6) is '1'. So the '2' at (4,5) needs two bombs. We already have (6,6) as a bomb, but that's not adjacent to (4,5). So the bombs must be among (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6). Let me see if any of these are adjacent to other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 5 (3,5) is '.', and it's adjacent to (3,4) '1' and (3,6) '.'. The '1' at (3,4) needs one bomb. So if (3,5) is a bomb, it would satisfy (3,4)'s '1'. But then the '2' at (4,5) would have one bomb at (3,5), so it needs another. Maybe (4,6) is another bomb.\n\nAlternatively, if (3,6) is a bomb, that would satisfy (3,5)'s '2'? Wait, no, (3,5) is '.', but (3,6) is '.' as well.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look for a number that's already surrounded by flags or bombs, and see if it's satisfied.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5 (5,5) is '1', which is satisfied by (6,6) being a bomb. So that's good.\n\nRow 6, column 4 (6,4) is '1'. Its neighbors are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). (5,3) is '1', (5,4) is '1', (5,5) is '1', (6,3) is '1', (6,5) is '1', (7,3) is '1', (7,4) is '1', (7,5) is '1'. So the '1' at (6,4) needs one bomb. The possible candidates are among these neighbors. Since (6,5) is '1', which is safe, the bomb must be elsewhere. Maybe (7,4) is a bomb? But (7,4) is '1', which is safe. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a number that has all possible bombs identified except one, allowing me to place a flag.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 0 (8,0) is '1'. Its neighbors are (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1). (7,0) is '.', (7,1) is '1', (8,1) is '1', (9,0) is '.', (9,1) is '1'. So the '1' at (8,0) needs one bomb. The possible bombs are in (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1). But (7,1) is '1', which is safe, (8,1) is '1', safe, (9,1) is '1', safe. So the bomb must be at (7,0) or (9,0). Let me check if either of these is adjacent to other numbers.\n\n(7,0) is '.', and it's adjacent to (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1). (6,0) is '_', (6,1) is '1', (7,1) is '1', (8,0) is '1', (8,1) is '1'. So if (7,0) is a bomb, it would satisfy the '1' at (8,0). But then, does that cause any conflicts elsewhere?\n\nAlternatively, if (9,0) is a bomb, that would satisfy the '1' at (8,0). Let me check (9,0)'s neighbors. (9,0) is '.', and its neighbors are (8,0), (8,1), (9,1). (8,0) is '1', (8,1) is '1', (9,1) is '1'. So if (9,0) is a bomb, it would satisfy the '1's at (8,0), (8,1), and (9,1). But (8,1) is '1', which is a number, so it's safe. So if (9,0) is a bomb, it would satisfy (8,0)'s '1' and (9,1)'s '1'. But (9,1) is '1', so it needs one bomb. If (9,0) is a bomb, that would satisfy (9,1)'s '1' as well. So maybe (9,0) is a bomb.\n\nBut wait, the total number of bombs is 10, and I've already flagged (6,6). So there are 9 bombs left, and 9 flags remaining, which matches. So if I flag (9,0), that would be one bomb. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nIf I flag (9,0), then the '1' at (8,0) is satisfied, the '1' at (9,1) is satisfied, and the '1' at (8,0) is satisfied. That seems possible. So maybe I should flag (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, maybe (7,0) is the bomb. Let's see. If I flag (7,0), then the '1' at (8,0) is satisfied, and the '1' at (7,1) would have one bomb at (7,0), which is good because (7,1) is '1'. So that could work too.\n\nBut I need to decide which one is more likely. Let me check the numbers around (7,0). (7,0) is adjacent to (6,0) '_', (6,1) '1', (7,1) '1', (8,0) '1', (8,1) '1'. So if (7,0) is a bomb, it would satisfy (6,1)'s '1' because (6,1) is '1', which needs one bomb. So if (7,0) is a bomb, then (6,1)'s '1' is satisfied. That seems like a good deduction.\n\nSo, if I flag (7,0), that would satisfy both (8,0)'s '1' and (6,1)'s '1'. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nIf (7,0) is a bomb, then the '1' at (6,1) is satisfied. The '1' at (7,1) would then need another bomb somewhere else. Let me see the neighbors of (7,1): (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0) is '_', (6,1) is '1', (6,2) is '1', (7,0) is now flagged as a bomb, (7,2) is '.', (8,0) is '1', (8,1) is '1', (8,2) is '.'. So the '1' at (7,1) is already satisfied by (7,0). So that's good.\n\nSo, flagging (7,0) as a bomb seems to satisfy multiple numbers. Let me see if that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, column 0 (4,0) is '_', which is empty. Its neighbors are (3,0) '1', (3,1) '2', (4,1) '1', (5,0) '_', (5,1) '_', (5,2) '_', (6,0) '_', (6,1) '1'. So the '1' at (3,0) needs one bomb. If (7,0) is a bomb, it's two rows below (5,0), so it's not adjacent to (3,0). So the bomb for (3,0) must be somewhere else.\n\nWait, (3,0) is '1', so it needs one bomb. Its neighbors are (2,0) '.', (2,1) '.', (3,1) '2', (4,0) '_', (4,1) '1', (4,-1) which is out of bounds. So the bomb must be at (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), or (4,1). But (4,0) is '_', so it's safe, (4,1) is '1', which is safe. So the bomb must be at (2,0) or (2,1). Let me check if either of these is adjacent to other numbers.\n\n(2,0) is adjacent to (1,0) '.', (1,1) '.', (2,1) '.', (3,0) '1', (3,1) '2', (4,0) '_', (4,1) '1'. So if (2,0) is a bomb, it would satisfy (3,0)'s '1' and (3,1)'s '2'. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nIf (2,0) is a bomb, then the '2' at (3,1) would have one bomb at (2,0), so it needs another bomb. Where could that be? The neighbors of (3,1) are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). If (2,0) is a bomb, then another bomb must be in (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2). But (4,1) is '1', which is safe, (4,2) is '1', safe. So the other bomb must be at (2,1) or (2,2) or (3,2). But (3,2) is '.', which is unexplored.\n\nAlternatively, if I flag (2,0), then (3,0)'s '1' is satisfied, and (3,1)'s '2' would need another bomb. Maybe at (2,1). Let me see.\n\nBut I only have 9 flags left, and I need to place 10 bombs. Wait, no, the total bombs are 10, and I've already flagged (6,6) and considering flagging (7,0) and (2,0). That would be three flags, leaving 7 more to place. But I need to make sure I don't exceed the total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a number that is already at its maximum, meaning all possible bombs are identified, allowing me to reveal other squares.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 1 (8,1) is '1'. Its neighbors are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). (7,0) is '.', (7,1) is '1', (7,2) is '.', (8,0) is '1', (8,2) is '.', (9,0) is '.', (9,1) is '1', (9,2) is '.'. So the '1' at (8,1) needs one bomb. The possible bombs are in (7,0), (7,2), (9,0), (9,2). But I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, if I flag (7,0), that would satisfy (8,1)'s '1' as well, because (7,0) is adjacent to (8,1). So if (7,0) is a bomb, it would satisfy both (3,0)'s '1' and (8,1)'s '1'. That seems efficient.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best move is to flag (7,0) as a bomb. That would satisfy multiple numbers and help me progress.\n\nSo, I'll place a flag at (7,0).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The position (7,0) is adjacent to multiple numbered tiles that require bombs. Flagging this square satisfies the '1's at (3,0), (6,1), and (8,1) without conflicting with any other numbers.\nMOVE: 7,0,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 1 2 . 1 1 . . . . .\n4 _ 1 1 1 1 2 . . . .\n5 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ F\n7 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n8 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board state and the game info provided.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 8 flags remaining, which means I've already placed 2 flags somewhere on the board. Let me check where those flags are. Looking at the board, I see a flag at position (6,9) and another at (7,9). Wait, no, looking again, position (6,9) is marked as 'F', and (7,9) is also 'F'. So that's two flags. So I have 8 more to place, but I need to be careful.\n\nNow, let's look at the board layout. I'll try to identify areas where I can deduce the presence of bombs or safe spots. Starting from the top, rows 0, 1, 2 are mostly unexplored, so maybe I can focus on the lower rows where there are numbers and flags.\n\nLooking at row 3: it has 1, 2, ., 1, 1, ., ., ., ., . So positions (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 2, (3,3) is 1, and (3,4) is 1. Let me check the surrounding cells for these numbers.\n\nFor (3,0) which is 1: its adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). Since (3,0) is 1, there should be exactly one bomb in these cells. Looking at (3,1), which is 2, so that might complicate things. Hmm, maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nRow 4: it starts with _, then 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, ., ., ., . So (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1, (4,3) is 1, (4,4) is 1, (4,5) is 2. Let's see the adjacent cells for these.\n\nFor (4,1)=1: adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). But (4,1) is 1, so only one bomb in these cells. But (4,0) is '_', which is empty, so no bomb there. Similarly, (5,0) is '_', so not a bomb. So the bomb must be in (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,1), or (5,2). But (3,0) is 1, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. So the bomb could be in (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,1), or (5,2). But (3,1) is 2, which is a number, so not a bomb. So possible bombs in (3,2), (4,2), (5,1), (5,2). But (4,2) is 1, so it's a number, not a bomb. So possible bombs in (3,2), (5,1), (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, for (4,5)=2: adjacent cells are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). But (4,5) is 2, so two bombs in these cells. Let's see: (3,4) is 1, (3,5) is '.', (3,6) is '.', (4,4) is 1, (4,6) is '.', (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is '.'. Hmm, but (5,4) is 1, which is a number, so not a bomb. So the bombs must be in (3,5), (3,6), (5,5), (5,6). But (5,5) is 1, so not a bomb. So possible bombs in (3,5), (3,6), (5,6). But (3,5) is '.', which is unexplored, same with (3,6) and (5,6). So not sure yet.\n\nMoving to row 5: it's _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1 1. So positions (5,4) to (5,9) are 1s. Let's look at (5,4)=1. Its adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=2, (5,3)='_', (5,5)=1, (6,3)='_', (6,4)='_', (6,5)='_'. So (5,4)=1 has only one bomb in these cells. But (4,3)=1, which is a number, so not a bomb. Similarly, (4,4)=1, not a bomb. So the bomb must be in (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), or (6,5). But (5,3) is '_', so maybe a bomb there. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 6: it's _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ F. So (6,4)=1, (6,6)=1, and (6,9)=F. Let's check (6,4)=1. Adjacent cells: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). Since (6,4)=1, only one bomb in these cells. (5,4)=1, which is a number, so not a bomb. So the bomb must be in (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), or (7,5). But (5,5)=1, so not a bomb. So possible bombs in (5,3), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). Hmm, a bit complicated.\n\nLooking at row 7: F _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _. So (7,0)=F, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=1, (7,6)=1. Let's check (7,4)=1. Its adjacent cells: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). Since (7,4)=1, only one bomb in these cells. (6,4)=1, so not a bomb. So the bomb must be in (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). But (7,5)=1, so not a bomb. So possible bombs in (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). Hmm.\n\nRow 8: 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _. So (8,0)=1, (8,1)=1. Let's check (8,0)=1. Adjacent cells: (7,0)=F, (7,1), (8,1)=1, (9,0), (9,1). Since (8,0)=1, there's one bomb in these cells. (7,0)=F is a flag, so that's one bomb accounted for. So the other cells (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1) must be safe. So I can probably reveal (7,1) or (9,0) or (9,1) as safe.\n\nWait, (7,1) is '_', which is unexplored. If I can determine it's safe, I can reveal it. Let me think: since (8,0)=1 has one bomb already at (7,0)=F, the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (7,1) is adjacent to (8,0)=1, which already has its bomb at (7,0). So (7,1) must be safe. So I can reveal (7,1).\n\nAlternatively, looking at (9,0)= '.', which is adjacent to (8,0)=1. Since (8,0)=1 has one bomb at (7,0)=F, (9,0) must be safe. So revealing (9,0) is also safe. But let me check other areas first.\n\nLooking at row 6, position (6,9)=F. So that's a flag, meaning a bomb is there. So (6,9) is a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 7, position (7,0)=F, so a bomb there.\n\nNow, looking at row 5: positions (5,4) to (5,9) are all 1s. Let's check (5,4)=1. Adjacent cells: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=2, (5,5)=1, (6,4)=1, so all these are numbers, so not bombs. So the bomb must be in (5,3), (6,3), or (6,5). But (6,3) is '_', (5,3) is '_', and (6,5) is '.'.\n\nWait, (6,5) is '.' which is unexplored. So if (5,4)=1 has only one bomb in (5,3), (6,3), or (6,5). Let me see if any of these can be determined.\n\nLooking at row 6, (6,4)=1. Its adjacent cells: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1, (7,4)=1, so they are numbers. So the bomb must be in (5,3), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5). But (5,3) is '_', (6,3) is '_', (6,5) is '.', (7,3) is '_', (7,5) is '.'.\n\nThis is getting a bit complex. Maybe I should look for areas where the number of flags plus revealed bombs equals the number on the tile. That could help.\n\nLooking at row 4, (4,5)=2. Its adjacent cells: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). (3,4)=1, (3,5)='.', (3,6)='.', (4,4)=1, (4,6)='.', (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)='.'. So the bombs must be in (3,5), (3,6), (5,6). But (5,6) is '.', (3,5) and (3,6) are '.' as well. So maybe I can't determine much here yet.\n\nLooking back at row 8: (8,0)=1 and (8,1)=1. Both have (7,0)=F as a bomb. So their other adjacent cells must be safe. So for (8,0)=1: adjacent cells (7,0)=F, (7,1), (8,1)=1, (9,0), (9,1). Since (7,0)=F is one bomb, the others must be safe. So (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1) are safe. So I can reveal (7,1) or (9,0) or (9,1).\n\nSimilarly, (8,1)=1: adjacent cells (7,0)=F, (7,1), (7,2), (8,0)=1, (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). Since (7,0)=F is one bomb, the other bombs must be in (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). But (8,1)=1, so only one bomb in these cells. But (7,0)=F is already one, so the rest must be safe. So (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2) must be safe. So I can reveal any of these.\n\nLooking at (9,0)= '.', which is adjacent to (8,0)=1, which has one bomb at (7,0)=F. So (9,0) must be safe. So revealing (9,0) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (7,1) is also safe.\n\nLet me check (9,0). If I reveal (9,0), what happens? It might give me more information. So let me consider that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, (3,3)=1. Its adjacent cells: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (3,4)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1. So the bomb must be in (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (4,2). But (4,2)=1, which is a number, so not a bomb. So the bomb must be in (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), or (3,2). But these are all '.' or '_' except (3,2) is '.'.\n\nHmm, not sure yet. Let me go back to row 8. Since (8,0)=1 has one bomb at (7,0)=F, and (8,1)=1 also has one bomb at (7,0)=F, so the other adjacent cells must be safe. So revealing (9,0) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9: (9,1)=1. Its adjacent cells: (8,0)=1, (8,1)=1, (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,0) but that's beyond the board. Wait, the board is 10x10, so row 9 is the last row. So (9,1)=1: adjacent cells are (8,0)=1, (8,1)=1, (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). Since (9,1)=1, there's one bomb in these cells. But (8,0)=1 and (8,1)=1 are numbers, so not bombs. So the bomb must be in (8,2), (9,0), or (9,2). But (9,0) is '.', which I think is safe as per earlier analysis. So if (9,0) is safe, then the bomb must be in (8,2) or (9,2). But I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, but if (9,0) is safe, then (9,1)=1's bomb must be in (8,2) or (9,2). But I can't be sure yet.\n\nLet me go back to row 8. Since (8,0)=1 and (8,1)=1, and both have their bombs accounted for by (7,0)=F, I can safely reveal (9,0) or (7,1).\n\nLet me check (9,0). If I reveal (9,0), what would happen? If it's a bomb, I lose. But according to the analysis, it's safe because (8,0)=1 has its bomb at (7,0)=F, so (9,0) must be safe.\n\nAlternatively, I can place a flag somewhere else. But I think revealing (9,0) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, (6,6)=1. Its adjacent cells: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (6,5)= '.', (6,7)='_', (7,5)=1, (7,6)=1, (7,7)='_'. So (6,6)=1, so one bomb in these cells. But (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (7,5)=1, (7,6)=1 are all numbers, so not bombs. So the bomb must be in (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,7). But these are all '.' or '_'. So I can't determine much here.\n\nWait, (6,9)=F, which is a bomb. So in row 6, (6,9) is a bomb. So looking at (5,9)=1. Its adjacent cells: (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9)=F, (7,8), (7,9)=F. So (5,9)=1, which has two flags already: (6,9)=F and (7,9)=F. Wait, but (5,9)=1, which is a number, so it must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. But (6,9)=F and (7,9)=F are two flags, which would mean two bombs, but (5,9)=1 requires only one. So that's a conflict. That means either one of the flags is incorrect, or I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because (5,9)=1 has two flags in its adjacent cells: (6,9)=F and (7,9)=F. So that's two bombs, but (5,9)=1 requires only one. So this is a conflict. That means one of the flags is incorrectly placed. So either (6,9)=F or (7,9)=F is not a bomb. So I need to check which one is actually a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 7, (7,9)=F. Let's see if that's necessary. Looking at row 7, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=1, (7,6)=1. So let's see (7,4)=1: adjacent cells (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). (6,4)=1, (7,5)=1, so numbers, not bombs. So the bomb must be in (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). But (8,5) is '.', (8,3)= '_', (7,3)='_', etc. Not sure yet.\n\nWait, but (7,9)=F is a flag. Let me see how many flags are around it. (7,9)=F is a bomb. Let's check the adjacent cells. (6,8), (6,9)=F, (7,8), (8,8), (8,9). So if (7,9)=F is a bomb, then the adjacent cells must have their numbers adjusted. But (6,9)=F is also a bomb, so that's two bombs adjacent to (7,9)=F, but (7,9) is a bomb itself, so maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, no, (7,9)=F is a bomb, so the adjacent cells must account for that. But (6,9)=F is also a bomb, so that's two bombs adjacent to (7,9)=F. But (7,9) is a bomb, so it's allowed to have multiple bombs around it. Wait, but the numbers on the board don't account for this. For example, (5,9)=1 has two bombs adjacent to it, which is a problem. So I must have placed a flag incorrectly.\n\nSo, (5,9)=1 has two flags adjacent to it, which is a conflict. So either (6,9)=F or (7,9)=F is incorrect. So I need to remove one of them.\n\nLooking at row 6, (6,9)=F. Let's check the adjacent cells of (6,9)=F. The adjacent cells are (5,8), (5,9)=1, (6,8), (7,8), (7,9)=F. So (5,9)=1 has (6,9)=F and (7,9)=F as adjacent bombs. But (5,9)=1 can only have one bomb, so one of these flags must be wrong. So either (6,9)=F or (7,9)=F is incorrect.\n\nHow can I determine which one is correct? Let's look at row 7, (7,9)=F. Let's see if (7,9)=F is necessary. Looking at row 7, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=1, (7,6)=1. Let's check (7,6)=1. Its adjacent cells: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). (7,5)=1, (6,6)=1, so numbers, not bombs. So the bomb must be in (6,5), (6,7), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). But (8,5) is '.', (8,6) is '.', etc. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (7,9)=F. Let's see the numbers around it. (6,8) is '.', (6,9)=F, (7,8) is '.', (8,8) is '.', (8,9) is '.'. So if (7,9)=F is a bomb, then the adjacent cells must reflect that. But (5,9)=1 is conflicting because it has two flags. So perhaps (7,9)=F is incorrect, and the bomb is actually at (6,9)=F. So I should remove (7,9)=F and place it elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (6,9)=F is incorrect. Let me check.\n\nLooking at row 6, (6,9)=F. Let's check the adjacent cells: (5,8), (5,9)=1, (6,8), (7,8), (7,9)=F. So if (6,9)=F is a bomb, then (5,9)=1 has two bombs adjacent to it, which is a conflict. So (6,9)=F must be incorrect. Therefore, (6,9) is not a bomb, so I should remove the flag there and place it elsewhere.\n\nWait, but (6,9)=F is a flag, so if it's incorrect, I should remove it. So I can make a move to remove the flag at (6,9). But wait, the user is asking for the next move, so perhaps I should remove the flag at (6,9) and place it elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, I can reveal (6,9) to see if it's a bomb or not. But revealing could be risky. Alternatively, I can look for other areas.\n\nWait, but (5,9)=1 has two flags adjacent to it, which is conflicting. So one of the flags must be removed. Let's see which one is more likely to be incorrect.\n\nLooking at row 6, (6,9)=F. Let's check the numbers around it. (5,9)=1, which is conflicting. So perhaps (6,9)=F is incorrect, and the bomb is actually at (7,9). So I should remove the flag at (6,9) and place it at (7,9). But wait, (7,9)=F is already a flag. So perhaps I should remove (6,9)=F and leave (7,9)=F. But (5,9)=1 can only have one bomb, so if (7,9)=F is the correct one, then (6,9) is safe. So I can remove the flag at (6,9) and reveal it, but that's risky because if it's a bomb, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (7,9)=F is the correct one, and (6,9) is safe. So I can reveal (6,9) to check. But that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look elsewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back to row 8, (8,0)=1 and (8,1)=1. Since (7,0)=F is a bomb, the other adjacent cells must be safe. So I can safely reveal (9,0) or (7,1).\n\nLet me try revealing (9,0). If I reveal (9,0), it's safe because (8,0)=1 has its bomb at (7,0)=F. So revealing (9,0) is safe.\n\nSo perhaps my next move is to reveal (9,0). Let me check the coordinates: x=9, y=0. So MOVE: 9,0,false.\n\nAlternatively, I can reveal (7,1), which is also safe.\n\nBut let's see: revealing (9,0) might give me more information. Let's proceed with that.\n\nWait, but (9,0) is in row 9, column 0. Let me check the adjacent cells. (8,0)=1, which is a number, so (9,0) being safe would mean that (8,0)=1 has its bomb at (7,0)=F, which is correct. So yes, (9,0) is safe.\n\nSo I think revealing (9,0) is a safe move.\n\nAlternatively, I could also reveal (7,1), which is also safe.\n\nBut let's go with (9,0) as the next move.\n\nSo the explanation would be that (8,0)=1 has its bomb at (7,0)=F, so (9,0) is safe to reveal.\n\nAlternatively, I could place a flag somewhere else, but I think revealing (9,0) is safe.\n\nWait, but I have 8 flags remaining, and I need to place 10 bombs. I've already placed 2 flags, so I need to place 8 more. But perhaps revealing (9,0) is a good next step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place a flag elsewhere.\n\nWait, let me check row 3, (3,1)=2. Its adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0)=1, (3,2), (4,0)= '_', (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. So (3,1)=2, which requires two bombs in these cells. The bombs could be at (4,0)= '_', (3,2), (4,1)=1 (which is a number, so not a bomb), (4,2)=1 (also a number), (2,0)='_', (2,1)='_', (2,2)='_', (3,0)=1 (number). So the bombs must be in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0). But (3,0)=1, which is a number, so not a bomb. So the bombs must be in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0). Since (3,1)=2, there must be two bombs in these cells. But I don't have any flags there yet. So maybe I can place flags in some of these cells.\n\nBut I have to be careful not to conflict with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place a flag at (4,0)= '_', because (3,0)=1 requires one bomb in its adjacent cells, which includes (4,0). So (3,0)=1 has (4,0) as a possible bomb. So placing a flag at (4,0) would satisfy (3,0)=1, and also contribute to (3,1)=2.\n\nSo if I place a flag at (4,0), that would account for one bomb for (3,0)=1 and one for (3,1)=2. Then I need another bomb for (3,1)=2. So perhaps (2,0)= '_' is another bomb.\n\nBut I have to check if placing a flag at (4,0) would conflict with other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 4, (4,0)='_'. If I place a flag there, then (4,0)=F. Let's check the adjacent cells: (3,-1) invalid, (3,0)=1, (3,1)=2, (4,1)=1, (5,0)= '_', (5,1)=1. So placing a flag at (4,0)=F would mean that (3,0)=1 has one bomb, which is correct. And (3,1)=2 would have one bomb at (4,0)=F, but it needs another bomb. So I need to find another bomb adjacent to (3,1)=2.\n\nLooking at (3,1)=2, which requires two bombs. If I place a flag at (4,0)=F, that's one bomb. The other bomb must be in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), or (4,0)=F. Wait, I just placed a flag at (4,0)=F, so that's one bomb. The other bomb must be in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), or (3,2). So perhaps I can place another flag there.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe I can reveal (2,0) to see if it's a bomb or not.\n\nWait, but (3,0)=1 has (4,0)=F as a bomb, so that's accounted for. So (2,0) is adjacent to (3,0)=1, but (3,0)=1 already has its bomb at (4,0)=F. So (2,0) must be safe. So I can reveal (2,0).\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should focus on the conflict in (5,9)=1.\n\nWait, (5,9)=1 has two flags adjacent to it: (6,9)=F and (7,9)=F. So one of them must not be a bomb. So perhaps (6,9)=F is incorrect, and the bomb is at (7,9)=F. Or vice versa.\n\nBut I can't be sure without more info. Alternatively, I can remove one of the flags and place it elsewhere.\n\nBut I think revealing (9,0) is a safe move because (8,0)=1 has its bomb at (7,0)=F, so (9,0) is safe.\n\nSo I think revealing (9,0) is a safe move.\n\nAlternatively, I can reveal (7,1), which is also safe.\n\nBut let's go with revealing (9,0).\n\nSo my next move would be to reveal (9,0).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. (8,0)=1 has (7,0)=F as its bomb. So (9,0) must be safe. So revealing (9,0) is safe.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (9,0) is safe because the adjacent number (8,0)=1 already has its bomb accounted for by the flag at (7,0).
