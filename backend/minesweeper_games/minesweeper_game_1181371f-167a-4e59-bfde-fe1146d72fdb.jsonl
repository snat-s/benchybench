{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing Minesweeper, and I just started a new game. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs. I have 10 flags remaining, which is exactly the number of bombs, so I need to flag all of them correctly. \n\nLooking at the board, everything is still unexplored. All the squares are dots, which means they're either unopened or flagged. Since the board is completely unexplored, I don't have any numbers or bombs revealed yet. That means I have to make an initial move somewhere. \n\nIn Minesweeper, the first move is always a bit risky because there's no information. But sometimes, people start in the middle of the board because it's less likely to hit a bomb, but I'm not sure if that's a real strategy or just a myth. Alternatively, I could start in a corner, which might give me a better chance of revealing a number early on, which can then help me deduce where the bombs are.\n\nLet me think about the corners. If I click on (0,0), which is the top-left corner, there's a 10% chance it's a bomb. If it's not, then it'll either be a number or empty. If it's a number, say 1, that tells me that one of the adjacent squares is a bomb. But since it's a corner, it only has two adjacent squares: (0,1) and (1,0). So if I reveal (0,0) and it's a 1, I know one of those two is a bomb. But since I have 10 flags, I could then flag one of them if necessary.\n\nAlternatively, if I start in the middle, say (5,5), I might get a number that's more informative because it has more adjacent squares. But the risk is higher because there are more squares around it, increasing the chance of hitting a bomb if I'm not careful.\n\nWait, but since the board is 10x10 and there are 10 bombs, the density is 10%. So each square has a 10% chance of being a bomb. So starting in a corner, which has only two adjacent squares, might be safer because if I hit a number, I can work from there. But if I start in the middle and it's a number, I can start deducing based on more squares.\n\nHmm, maybe I should start in the middle. Let's say I click on (5,5). If it's a number, I can then check the surrounding squares. If it's 3, for example, I know three of the surrounding eight squares are bombs. Then I can start flagging accordingly. But if it's a 0, that means all adjacent squares are safe, which can help me clear a larger area quickly.\n\nWait, but since the board is completely unopened, maybe I should start in the middle of the top row, like (0,5). That way, I can potentially reveal a number that can help me figure out the bombs in the top half of the board.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start with (0,0) to get the corner. Let's see, if I click on (0,0), and it's a bomb, I lose. But if it's a number, say 1, then I know either (0,1) or (1,0) is a bomb. But with 10 flags, I can then flag one of them.\n\nBut since I have to make a move, and I can't know the outcome, maybe I should go with a corner. Let's pick (0,0). If I click there, and it's a number, I can start deducing. If it's a bomb, I lose, but that's a 10% chance.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about the distribution of bombs. Since there are 10 bombs on a 10x10 board, the average number of bombs per row is 1. So each row has one bomb on average. So if I click on (0,0), which is a corner, maybe the bombs are spread out, so it's less likely to hit a bomb in the first move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should click on (5,5) because it's the center, and if it's a number, it can help me figure out the surrounding squares more effectively.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with the center because it's more strategic. Let's say I click on (5,5). If it's a number, I can start flagging the surrounding squares based on that number. If it's a bomb, I lose, but that's a 10% chance.\n\nWait, but if I click on (5,5) and it's a bomb, I lose immediately, which is bad. So maybe I should avoid the very center because it's a high-risk area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start near the edge but not in the corner. Let's say I click on (0,4). That's near the top edge, but not in the corner. It has three adjacent squares: (0,3), (0,5), and (1,4). So if I click there and it's a number, I can work from there.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should just go with the corner. Let's say I click on (0,0). If it's a number, I can start flagging. If it's a bomb, I lose, but that's a 10% chance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should click on (4,4). That's near the center but not exactly the middle. It has eight adjacent squares, so if it's a number, I can start deducing.\n\nWait, but since the board is completely unopened, maybe I should start in the middle of the board, like (5,5), but I'm a bit hesitant because of the 10% chance of losing immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should click on (0,0) because if it's a number, it can give me information about the surrounding squares. Let's say I click on (0,0) and it's a 1. Then I know that either (0,1) or (1,0) is a bomb. Then I can flag one of them, and that would help me proceed.\n\nBut since the board is completely unopened, maybe I should click on (5,5). Let's go with that. So I'll click on (5,5), and if it's a number, I can start working from there.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should start on the edge. Let's say I click on (0,5). That's the middle of the top row. It has three adjacent squares: (0,4), (0,6), and (1,5). If I click there and it's a number, I can start flagging.\n\nBut I'm still not sure. Maybe I should just pick a corner. Let's go with (0,0). So I'll click on (0,0) and see what happens. If it's a number, I can proceed. If it's a bomb, I lose, but that's a risk I have to take.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that the bombs are randomly placed, so the first move is always a guess. So I might as well pick a spot that, if it's a number, gives me the most information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start in the middle of the board, like (5,5), because if it's a number, I can start working from there. But if it's a bomb, I lose. So maybe I should take a slightly safer spot, like (4,4), which is still near the center but not exactly the middle.\n\nBut honestly, without any information, the first move is always a gamble. So I think I'll go with (0,0). Let's say I click on (0,0), and if it's a bomb, I lose. But if it's a number, I can start flagging.\n\nWait, but since I have to provide a move, I have to decide. Let me think again. Maybe I should start in the middle of the board, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should start in the middle of the top row, like (0,5). That way, if it's a number, I can work on the top half.\n\nBut I'm overcomplicating it. Let's just pick a spot. I think I'll go with (5,5). So I'll click there, and if it's a number, I can proceed. If it's a bomb, I lose, but that's the risk.\n\nWait, but (5,5) is the exact center. Maybe I should avoid that because it's a high-risk area. Let me think again. Maybe I should click on (4,4), which is near the center but not the exact middle. That way, if it's a number, I can start working from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should click on (0,0), the top-left corner. Let's say I click there, and it's a 1. Then I know one of the adjacent squares is a bomb. I can then flag one of them, and that would help me proceed.\n\nBut without any information, it's hard to decide. Maybe I should just click on (5,5) and take the risk. If it's a number, I can start flagging. If it's a bomb, I lose, but that's the game.\n\nWait, but I have to make a move. So I think I'll go with (5,5). Let's say I click there. If it's a 3, for example, I know three of the surrounding squares are bombs, and I can start flagging them. But if it's a bomb, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should click on (0,5). That's the middle of the top row. It has three adjacent squares, so if it's a number, I can start flagging.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let me just pick a spot. I think I'll go with (5,5). So I'll click there, and if it's a number, I can start flagging. If it's a bomb, I lose, but that's the game.\n\nWait, but I have to provide a move. So I think I'll go with (5,5), flag=false, meaning I'm revealing the square.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should click on (0,0) instead. Let me think again.\n\nIf I click on (0,0), and it's a 1, then I know one of (0,1) or (1,0) is a bomb. Then I can flag one of them. If it's a 2, then both (0,1) and (1,0) are bombs, so I can flag both. If it's a 0, then I can reveal all surrounding squares, which would be helpful.\n\nBut if I click on (0,0) and it's a bomb, I lose. So maybe I should take a slightly safer spot, like (4,4). That's near the center, but not the exact middle. Let's say I click there. If it's a number, I can start flagging. If it's a bomb, I lose, but that's the risk.\n\nWait, but I'm overcomplicating it. The first move is always a guess, so I might as well pick a spot that, if it's a number, gives me the most information. So I'll go with (5,5). Let's click there.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Choosing the center of the board (5,5) as the first move to potentially reveal a number that can help deduce the location of adjacent bombs, providing a strategic starting point for further moves.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 3, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left with 10 flags remaining. So, I need to either reveal a safe square or place a flag correctly.\n\nLooking at the board state, I'll start by analyzing each number and the surrounding squares to see if I can deduce where the bombs are. Let's go row by row.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- At (0,4), there's a '1'. So, there should be exactly one bomb in the adjacent 8 squares. Let's check around it. The adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (0,4) itself. Wait, (0,4) is the number, so the adjacent are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). Currently, (1,4) is a '1' as well. Hmm, maybe not immediately helpful.\n\nRow 1:\n- At (1,4), another '1'. So, same as above. The adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). Wait, (2,4) is '2', so that might be connected.\n\nRow 2:\n- (2,4) is '2'. So, two bombs around it. Let's look around. Adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Currently, (1,4) is '1', (2,5) is '1', and (3,4) is '.', so maybe some flags there.\n\nRow 3:\n- (3,4) is '1'. So, one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,4) is '2', which already has some info.\n\nRow 4:\n- (4,4) is '2'. So, two bombs around it. Adjacent squares are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,4) is '1', so that's one bomb accounted for, so there must be another bomb somewhere else around (4,4).\n\nRow 5:\n- (5,4) is '1'. So, one bomb around it. Adjacent squares are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,4) is '2', so maybe a bomb near there.\n\nRow 6:\n- (6,3) is '2'. So, two bombs around it. Adjacent squares are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,3) is '.', (5,4) is '1', so maybe some flags there.\n\nRow 7:\n- (7,3) is '1'. So, one bomb around it. Adjacent squares are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (6,3) is '2', so maybe a bomb nearby.\n\nRow 8:\n- (8,4) is '1'. So, one bomb around it. Adjacent squares are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). (7,3) is '1', (9,4) is '1' in row 9.\n\nRow 9:\n- (9,9) is '1'. So, one bomb around it. Adjacent squares are (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). (8,8) is '.', (8,9) is '.', (9,8) is '.'.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for areas where numbers are already indicating certain things. Let's check row 2, column 4: '2'. So, two bombs around it. Let's see the adjacent squares. (1,3) is '.', (1,4) is '1', (1,5) is '1', (2,3) is '.', (2,5) is '1', (3,3) is '.', (3,4) is '1', (3,5) is '.'.\n\nWait, (3,4) is '1', so that's one bomb. So, the other bomb must be somewhere else around (2,4). Maybe (1,3) or (3,3). But I don't have enough info yet.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4: '1'. So, one bomb around it. The adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4) '2', (2,5) '1', (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4) '2', (4,5). So, the bomb could be in (3,3) or (3,5) or (4,3) or (4,5). But (4,4) is '2', so maybe (4,3) or (4,5) is a bomb.\n\nWait, (4,4) is '2', so two bombs around it. One could be in (3,4) which is '1', but that's a number, not a bomb. So, maybe (4,3) or (4,5) or (5,4). But (5,4) is '1', so maybe (4,3) or (4,5).\n\nBut let's look at row 4, column 4: '2'. So, two bombs around it. The adjacent squares are (3,3), (3,4) '1', (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4) '1', (5,5). So, considering (3,4) is '1', which means one bomb in its adjacent squares. So, (4,4)'s bombs could be (4,3) and (4,5), or (5,3) and (5,5). But (5,4) is '1', so maybe (5,3) or (5,5) are bombs.\n\nWait, (5,4) is '1', so one bomb around it. Its adjacent squares are (4,3), (4,4) '2', (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3) '2', (6,4), (6,5). So, the bomb could be in (5,3) or (5,5) or (6,3) or (6,5). But (6,3) is '2', which needs two bombs around it. So, maybe (6,3) is adjacent to two bombs.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 3: '2'. So, two bombs around it. Adjacent squares are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) '1', (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3) '1', (7,4). So, the bombs could be in (5,3) or (7,3). But (7,3) is '1', so it has one bomb around it. So, maybe (5,3) is a bomb, which would satisfy both (5,4)'s '1' and (6,3)'s '2'.\n\nIf (5,3) is a bomb, then (5,4)'s '1' is satisfied. Also, (6,3)'s '2' would need another bomb. Where else? Maybe (6,5) or (7,3). But (7,3) is '1', so it can only have one bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (7,3) is a bomb, which would satisfy both (6,3)'s '2' and (7,3)'s '1' (since (7,3) is a number, it's a safe square, so the bomb can't be there. Wait, no, (7,3) is a '1', so it's a safe square. So, the bomb must be adjacent to it. So, the bomb can't be at (7,3), but around it.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to mark possible bombs.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4: '1'. So, one bomb around it. If (5,3) is a bomb, that would satisfy this. Then, for (6,3)'s '2', the other bomb could be at (6,5) or (7,3). But (7,3) is '1', so it can't have a bomb there. So, maybe (6,5) is a bomb.\n\nBut let's check row 6, column 5: it's '.', so maybe a bomb there. If so, that would satisfy (6,3)'s '2' and (5,4)'s '1'.\n\nWait, but (5,4) is '1', so only one bomb. If (5,3) is a bomb, that's one. If (6,5) is a bomb, that's another, but (5,4) would then have two bombs, which contradicts the '1'. So, that can't be.\n\nSo, maybe (5,3) is a bomb, which satisfies (5,4)'s '1', and (6,3)'s '2' would need another bomb. So, perhaps (6,5) is a bomb. But then, (6,5) being a bomb would affect other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (7,3) is a bomb, but that's a '1' in row 7, column 3. Wait, no, (7,3) is '1', so it's a safe square, so the bomb must be adjacent to it. So, the bomb could be at (6,3), but (6,3) is '2', so that's a number, not a bomb. So, the bomb must be elsewhere around (7,3). So, (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). Hmm, but (8,4) is '1', so it's a number, so the bomb can't be there. So, maybe (7,2) or (8,3).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for other areas with more clues.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 9: '1'. So, one bomb around it. The adjacent squares are (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). So, one of these must be a bomb. But I don't have any other numbers nearby, so it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 9: '1'. So, one bomb around it. Adjacent squares are (0,8), (1,8), (1,9). So, one of these must be a bomb.\n\nWait, but (1,9) is '.', so maybe it's a bomb. But I don't have any other info there.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 0, column 4: '1'. So, one bomb around it. Adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4) '1', (1,5) '1'. So, the bomb could be in (0,3) or (0,5) or (1,3). But (1,3) is '.', so maybe it's a bomb.\n\nWait, but (1,3) is '.', which is unexplored. If I place a flag there, that would satisfy (0,4)'s '1'. But I need to make sure it doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (0,5) is a bomb. Because (0,5) is '1', but wait, (0,5) is '1' as a number. Wait, no, in row 0, column 5 is '_', which is empty revealed space. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, the board state shows row 0 as: . . . . 1 _ 1 . . . So, position (0,4) is '1', (0,5) is '_', (0,6) is '1', etc. So, (0,5) is an empty revealed space, so no bomb there. So, the bomb for (0,4)'s '1' must be in (0,3), (1,3), or (1,4). But (1,4) is '1', which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, the bomb must be in (0,3) or (1,3). So, maybe (0,3) is a bomb.\n\nIf I place a flag at (0,3), that would satisfy (0,4)'s '1'. Let me check if that affects other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 4: '1'. If (0,3) is a bomb, then (1,4)'s '1' is satisfied, but wait, (1,4) is '1', so it needs one bomb. If (0,3) is a bomb, that's one bomb for (0,4)'s '1', but (1,4)'s '1' would need another bomb elsewhere. So, perhaps (1,3) is a bomb. But then (0,4)'s '1' would have two bombs: (0,3) and (1,3), which would conflict because (0,4) is '1', meaning only one bomb.\n\nSo, that can't be. Therefore, if (0,3) is a bomb, then (1,4)'s '1' would need another bomb, but that would make (0,4)'s '1' have two bombs, which is invalid. So, maybe (0,3) is not a bomb. Then, the bomb must be in (1,3). So, placing a flag at (1,3).\n\nBut let's check if that works. If (1,3) is a bomb, then (0,4)'s '1' is satisfied. Also, (1,4)'s '1' would have (1,3) as a bomb, so that's satisfied. Then, looking at row 2, column 4: '2'. So, two bombs around it. The adjacent squares are (1,3) [flagged], (1,4) '1', (1,5) '1', (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4) '1', (3,5). So, if (1,3) is a bomb, that's one, so we need another bomb around (2,4). The possible squares are (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5). Let's see.\n\nIf (2,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy (2,4)'s '2' because (1,5) is '1', which already has one bomb. Wait, (1,5) is '1', so it needs one bomb. If (2,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy both (2,4)'s '2' and (1,5)'s '1'. That seems possible.\n\nSo, placing flags at (1,3) and (2,5). But I can only place one flag at a time. Alternatively, revealing a safe square.\n\nWait, but I have to consider the total number of flags remaining. There are 10 flags left and 10 bombs, so I need to flag all bombs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a square that is definitely safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 5: '1'. So, one bomb around it. If (2,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy (2,4)'s '2' (since (1,3) is a bomb and (2,5) is another). But (2,5) is '.', so maybe it's a bomb.\n\nWait, but if (2,5) is a bomb, then (2,4)'s '2' is satisfied. Also, (1,5)'s '1' would have (2,5) as a bomb, so that's satisfied.\n\nSo, maybe (2,5) is a bomb. But I can't place a flag there yet because I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, column 3: '2'. So, two bombs around it. The adjacent squares are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) '1', (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3) '1', (7,4). So, the bombs could be in (5,3) and (7,3), but (7,3) is '1', so it can't be a bomb. So, maybe (5,3) and (6,5) are bombs.\n\nIf (5,3) is a bomb, that would satisfy (5,4)'s '1' and (6,3)'s '2'. Then, (6,3)'s '2' would need another bomb, maybe at (6,5). So, placing flags at (5,3) and (6,5).\n\nBut again, I can only place one flag at a time. Alternatively, maybe I can reveal a square that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 3: '.', which is unexplored. If I can determine if it's safe, I can reveal it.\n\nWait, (2,3) is adjacent to (2,4)'s '2'. If (2,4) has two bombs, and if (1,3) and (2,5) are bombs, then (2,3) is safe. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, column 4: '2'. So, two bombs around it. If (4,3) and (4,5) are bombs, that would satisfy it. Let's check.\n\nIf (4,3) is a bomb, then (3,4)'s '1' is satisfied. Also, (4,4)'s '2' is satisfied with (4,3) and (4,5). But I don't know about (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,3) and (5,5) are bombs. Let's see.\n\nWait, (5,4) is '1', so one bomb around it. If (5,3) is a bomb, that's one. Then, (6,3)'s '2' would need another bomb, maybe (6,5). So, (5,3) and (6,5) as bombs.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a square that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 9: '1'. So, one bomb around it. The adjacent squares are (7,8), (7,9), (8,8). So, one of these must be a bomb.\n\nBut without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, looking at row 8, column 4: '1'. So, one bomb around it. Adjacent squares are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). So, one of these is a bomb. But (7,3) is '1', so it's a safe square, so the bomb can't be there. So, the bomb must be in (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,5).\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 7, column 3: '1'. So, one bomb around it. Adjacent squares are (6,2), (6,3) '2', (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4) '1'. So, the bomb could be in (7,2) or (8,3) or (8,4). But (8,4) is '1', so it's a number, not a bomb. So, maybe (7,2) or (8,3).\n\nIf I place a flag at (7,2), that would satisfy (7,3)'s '1'. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, column 3: '2'. So, two bombs around it. If I can find two bombs around it, that would help.\n\nWait, if (5,3) is a bomb, that's one. Then, another bomb could be at (6,5). So, (5,3) and (6,5) as bombs.\n\nBut let's check (5,3). If I place a flag there, does it conflict with any numbers?\n\nLooking at (5,4)'s '1', which would be satisfied by (5,3). Also, (6,3)'s '2' would need another bomb, perhaps at (6,5).\n\nSo, maybe I should place a flag at (5,3). Let's see if that conflicts with other numbers.\n\n(5,3) is adjacent to (5,2), (5,4) '1', (6,2), (6,3) '2', (6,4). So, placing a flag at (5,3) would satisfy (5,4)'s '1' and contribute to (6,3)'s '2'.\n\nBut I need to make sure that (6,3)'s '2' has exactly two bombs. So, if (5,3) is one, the other could be at (6,5). So, I can place a flag at (5,3) now.\n\nBut wait, I have to make sure that placing a flag at (5,3) doesn't conflict with other numbers. Let's check:\n\n- (4,3) is '.', (4,4) is '2', which would have (5,3) as one bomb, so it needs another bomb around it. So, maybe (4,5) is another bomb.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe (5,3) is a bomb, and (6,5) is another bomb.\n\nBut I think the most straightforward next move is to place a flag at (5,3) because it's adjacent to (5,4)'s '1' and (6,3)'s '2', which would satisfy both.\n\nSo, I think I'll place a flag at (5,3).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The square at (5,3) is adjacent to the '1' at (5,4) and the '2' at (6,3). Placing a flag here satisfies both numbers and helps progress towards revealing other safe squares.\n\nMOVE: 5,3,flag=true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n1 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n2 . . . . 2 _ 1 1 2 1\n3 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n4 . . . . 2 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n8 . . . 1 1 1 1 . 1 _\n9 . . . . . . . . 1 _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 8, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this Minesweeper board, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's start by understanding the current state.\n\nThe board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left, with 10 flags remaining. That means I need to flag all 10 bombs correctly or reveal all the safe squares. \n\nLooking at the board, I see a lot of numbers and some revealed empty spaces. My goal is to either reveal a safe square or place a flag where a bomb is likely. \n\nI'll start by checking each numbered cell to see if the number of adjacent flags matches the number. If there's a discrepancy, that might indicate where a bomb is or isn't.\n\nLet's go row by row, starting from the top.\n\nRow 0:\n- (0,4) is 1. Let's check its adjacent cells. The cells around it are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). I don't see any flags here, so this '1' needs one flag in these cells. But I don't see any obvious candidates yet.\n\nRow 1:\n- (1,4) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). Again, no flags here. So this '1' also needs one flag nearby.\n\nRow 2:\n- (2,4) is 2. Adjacent cells: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). I don't see any flags here, so this '2' needs two flags in these cells.\n- (2,7) is 2. Adjacent cells: (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). Again, no flags. So this '2' needs two flags around it.\n\nRow 3:\n- (3,4) is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). No flags here, so one flag needed.\n\nRow 4:\n- (4,2) is 2. Adjacent cells: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). No flags, so two flags needed.\n- (4,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). Again, no flags. Two flags needed here.\n\nRow 5:\n- (5,2) is 2. Adjacent cells: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). No flags, so two flags needed.\n- (5,4) is 1. Adjacent cells: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). No flags, so one flag needed.\n\nRow 6:\n- (6,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). No flags, so two flags needed.\n\nRow 7:\n- (7,6) is 1. Adjacent cells: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). No flags, so one flag needed.\n\nRow 8:\n- (8,6) is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). No flags, so one flag needed.\n\nRow 9:\n- (9,9) is 1. Adjacent cells: (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). No flags, so one flag needed here.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of numbers that need flags. Let me see if any of these numbers have flags already placed. From the board, I don't see any 'F's, so all the flags are yet to be placed.\n\nNow, considering the number of bombs left is 10, and flags remaining are 10, each flag I place must be correct.\n\nLooking for areas where a number is surrounded by a high concentration of possible bombs. Maybe starting with the lower numbers since they have fewer possibilities.\n\nLooking at (0,4) which is 1. Let's check its adjacent cells. The cells around it are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). Since it's a '1', exactly one of these must be a bomb. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, maybe looking at (9,9) which is 1. Its adjacent cells are (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). So one of these three must be a bomb. Since (9,9) is on the edge, maybe (9,8) is the bomb? Or (8,9)? Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (7,6) which is 1. Its adjacent cells are (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). Again, one of these must be a bomb. \n\nWait, (8,6) is also 1. So (8,6) is 1, meaning one bomb among its adjacent cells. But (8,6) is adjacent to (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). Hmm, overlapping with (7,6)'s adjacent cells.\n\nThis might be a bit complex. Maybe I should look for a cell that's adjacent to multiple numbers, which could help deduce where the bombs are.\n\nLooking at (4,2) which is 2. Its adjacent cells include (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). Since it's a 2, two of these must be bombs. But without more info, it's tricky.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the bottom right corner. (9,9) is 1, and it's adjacent to (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). If I flag (9,8), that would satisfy the '1' for (9,9). But I need to check if that affects other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (5,4) which is 1. Its adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So one of these must be a bomb.\n\nWait, (6,3) is 2. So (6,3) has two bombs around it. Its adjacent cells are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). Since (6,3) is 2, two of these must be bombs.\n\nBut (5,4) is 1, so one of its adjacent cells must be a bomb. If (5,4) is 1, and (6,3) is 2, maybe (5,3) is a bomb? Because (5,3) is adjacent to both (5,4) and (6,3). If (5,3) is a bomb, that would satisfy both the '1' in (5,4) and the '2' in (6,3). Let's check.\n\nIf (5,3) is a bomb, then (5,4)'s count is satisfied. For (6,3), it would still need one more bomb. Maybe (7,3)? But (7,3) is adjacent to (7,6), which is 1. So if (7,3) is a bomb, then (7,6) would have at least one bomb, but (7,6) is 1, so only one bomb in its adjacent cells. So if (7,3) is a bomb, that would satisfy (7,6)'s count. But then (6,3) would have (5,3) and (7,3) as bombs, satisfying its '2' count. That seems possible.\n\nBut wait, if (5,3) is a bomb, then (5,4)'s '1' is satisfied. Then (6,3) has (5,3) as one bomb, so it needs another. Maybe (7,3) as the second bomb. But (7,3) is adjacent to (7,6), which is 1. So (7,6) would have (7,3) as a bomb, which is one, satisfying its count. That seems to fit.\n\nSo, tentatively, I can consider (5,3) and (7,3) as bombs. But I need to check if this affects other numbers.\n\nLooking at (4,3), which is 2. Its adjacent cells are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). If (5,3) is a bomb, that's one, so another bomb is needed here. Maybe (5,2)? But (5,2) is adjacent to (5,4), which is 1, so if (5,2) is a bomb, that would give (5,4) two bombs, which is more than its count. So that can't be. Therefore, the other bomb for (4,3) must be somewhere else, maybe (3,3) or (3,4). \n\nWait, (3,4) is 1. So if (3,4) is 1, and if (4,3) needs two bombs, perhaps (3,3) and (3,4) are bombs. But (3,4) is 1, so only one bomb adjacent. If (3,3) is a bomb, that would satisfy (3,4)'s count. But (3,3) is adjacent to (4,3), which is 2. So if (3,3) is a bomb, that's one for (4,3). Then, another bomb is needed for (4,3). Maybe (5,3) as I thought earlier. So (3,3) and (5,3) as bombs.\n\nBut then (3,3) is a bomb, which is adjacent to (3,4), which is 1. So that's correct. Also, (3,3) is adjacent to (4,3), which is 2, so that's one bomb, needing another. (5,3) would be the second.\n\nThis seems to fit. So tentatively, I can flag (5,3) and (3,3). But I need to check if this affects other numbers.\n\nWait, (3,3) is a bomb, so let's see its impact. It's adjacent to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). \n\n(2,4) is 2. So if (3,3) is a bomb, that's one for (2,4). It needs another. Maybe (2,5)? But (2,5) is adjacent to (2,4), which is 2. If (2,5) is a bomb, that would give (2,4) two bombs, which is correct. But (2,5) is adjacent to (2,4) and (2,6), which is 1. Wait, (2,6) is 1. So if (2,5) is a bomb, then (2,6)'s count is satisfied, but (2,5) is also adjacent to (1,5), which is 1. So (1,5) is 1, which would have (2,5) as a bomb, satisfying it. That seems possible.\n\nWait, but (2,5) is adjacent to (2,4), which is 2. So if (2,5) is a bomb, that's one for (2,4), needing another. Maybe (2,3)? But (2,3) is adjacent to (2,2), which is 2. If (2,3) is a bomb, that would give (2,2) two bombs, satisfying it. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- (3,3) is a bomb.\n- (5,3) is a bomb.\n- (2,5) is a bomb.\n- (2,3) is a bomb.\n\nBut wait, if (2,3) is a bomb, then (2,2) which is 2, would have two bombs: (2,3) and perhaps (1,2). But (1,2) is adjacent to (1,1), which is 1. If (1,2) is a bomb, that would satisfy (1,1)'s count. But (1,1) is 1, so only one bomb adjacent. So if (1,2) is a bomb, that works. But then (1,2) is adjacent to (2,2), which is 2. So (2,2) would have (1,2) and (2,3) as bombs, which is correct. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a cell that's only adjacent to one number, making it a likely bomb.\n\nLooking at (9,9) which is 1. Its adjacent cells are (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). If I flag (9,8), that would satisfy (9,9)'s count. But I need to check if that affects other numbers.\n\n(9,8) is adjacent to (8,7), (8,8), (9,7). (8,7) is 1, so if (9,8) is a bomb, that would satisfy (8,7)'s count. Wait, (8,7) is 1, so it needs one bomb adjacent. If (9,8) is a bomb, that would be adjacent to (8,7), but (8,7) is 1, so that would satisfy it. But then, (9,8) is a bomb, which would also be adjacent to (9,7), which is 1. So (9,7) would have (9,8) as a bomb, satisfying its count. \n\nWait, (9,7) is 1. So if (9,8) is a bomb, that's one. But (9,7) is also adjacent to (8,6), which is 1. So (8,6) is 1, which would have (9,7) as a bomb? No, because (9,7) is 1, not a bomb. Wait, no, (9,7) is a number, so it's safe. So (8,6) is 1, and its adjacent cells are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). If (9,7) is 1, it's not a bomb. So (8,6) needs one bomb in its adjacent cells. If (9,8) is a bomb, it's not adjacent to (8,6). So (8,6) must have another bomb elsewhere. Maybe (8,5) is a bomb? But (8,5) is adjacent to (8,6), which is 1. So if (8,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy (8,6)'s count. But (8,5) is also adjacent to (7,4), which is 1. So (7,4) is 1, which needs one bomb. If (8,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy (7,4)'s count. But (8,5) is also adjacent to (9,5), which is 1. So (9,5) is 1, which would have (8,5) as a bomb, satisfying it. \n\nThis seems like a possible chain. So:\n\n- (9,8) is a bomb, satisfying (9,9) and (8,7).\n- (8,5) is a bomb, satisfying (8,6) and (7,4).\n- (9,5) is 1, so it's adjacent to (8,5), which is a bomb, so that's correct.\n\nBut wait, (8,5) is a bomb, which is adjacent to (7,4), which is 1. So that's correct. \n\nBut let's count the bombs so far: (9,8), (8,5). That's two bombs. We need 10, but let's see if this chain continues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for a cell that's only adjacent to one number, making it more likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (9,9) again. It's 1, and the only cells adjacent are (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). If I flag (9,8), that would satisfy (9,9). But I need to check if (9,8) is a bomb, does it conflict with other numbers.\n\n(9,8) is adjacent to (8,7), which is 1. So if (9,8) is a bomb, that would satisfy (8,7)'s count. But (8,7) is 1, so only one bomb. So (9,8) as a bomb would satisfy both (9,9) and (8,7). That seems efficient.\n\nSo, perhaps flagging (9,8) would be a good move. Let's see if that's safe.\n\nIf I flag (9,8), that's one flag used. Then, I can check if other numbers are satisfied.\n\nBut wait, (8,7) is 1, and if (9,8) is a bomb, that's one, so no more bombs around (8,7). So, cells around (8,7) are (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). If (9,8) is a bomb, then no other bombs are allowed around (8,7). So (8,7) is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, (9,9) is satisfied by (9,8). \n\nBut let's check (8,6), which is 1. Its adjacent cells include (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). If (8,6) is 1, and (9,8) is a bomb, that's not adjacent. So (8,6) needs another bomb. Maybe (9,6) is a bomb? But (9,6) is adjacent to (9,5), which is 1. So if (9,6) is a bomb, (9,5) would have two bombs: (9,6) and (9,8). But (9,5) is 1, which would be incorrect. So (9,6) can't be a bomb. Therefore, (8,6) must have another bomb elsewhere. Maybe (8,5) is a bomb.\n\nIf (8,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy (8,6)'s count. But (8,5) is adjacent to (7,4), which is 1. So (7,4) would have (8,5) as a bomb, satisfying it. Also, (8,5) is adjacent to (9,5), which is 1. So (9,5) would have (8,5) as a bomb, satisfying it. \n\nSo, flagging (9,8) and (8,5) would satisfy several numbers:\n\n- (9,9): 1 (satisfied by (9,8))\n- (8,7): 1 (satisfied by (9,8))\n- (8,6): 1 (satisfied by (8,5))\n- (7,4): 1 (satisfied by (8,5))\n- (9,5): 1 (satisfied by (8,5))\n\nThat's five bombs accounted for. We have 10 to place, so five more.\n\nLooking elsewhere, let's check (5,4) which is 1. Its adjacent cells include (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). If (5,3) is a bomb, that would satisfy (5,4)'s count. Then, (5,3) is also adjacent to (4,2), which is 2. So (4,2) is 2, so if (5,3) is a bomb, that's one, needing another. Maybe (4,1) is a bomb? But (4,1) is adjacent to (4,2), which is 2. So if (4,1) is a bomb, that's one for (4,2), needing another. Maybe (3,2) is a bomb? But (3,2) is adjacent to (3,1), which is 1. So if (3,2) is a bomb, that would satisfy (3,1)'s count.\n\nWait, (3,1) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). So if (3,2) is a bomb, that would satisfy (3,1)'s count. \n\nBut (3,2) is also adjacent to (4,2), which is 2. So if (3,2) is a bomb, that's one for (4,2), needing another. Maybe (4,1) is a bomb. So:\n\n- (3,2) is a bomb, satisfying (3,1) and contributing to (4,2).\n- (4,1) is a bomb, contributing to (4,2) and (5,1), which is 1.\n\nWait, (5,1) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). If (4,1) is a bomb, that would satisfy (5,1)'s count. \n\nSo, tentatively, flagging (9,8), (8,5), (5,3), (3,2), (4,1) would satisfy several numbers. But that's five flags, and I have 10 to place. Maybe that's a good start.\n\nBut before I place flags, I need to ensure that placing these flags doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nWait, let's check (4,2) which is 2. If (3,2) and (4,1) are bombs, that's two, which satisfies (4,2). Good.\n\n(5,4) is 1, which would be satisfied by (5,3). \n\n(2,4) is 2, which would need two bombs. If (3,4) is a bomb, that's one, needing another. Maybe (2,3) is a bomb? But (2,3) is adjacent to (2,2), which is 2. So if (2,3) is a bomb, that's one for (2,2), needing another. Maybe (1,2) is a bomb, which is adjacent to (1,1), which is 1. So (1,1) would have (1,2) as a bomb, satisfying it. \n\nBut (1,2) is adjacent to (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). If (1,2) is a bomb, that's one for (1,1), but (1,1) is 1, so that's correct. \n\nThis is getting quite involved. Maybe I should look for a cell that, when flagged, doesn't conflict with any numbers.\n\nLooking back at (9,9), which is 1. The only way to satisfy this is to have exactly one bomb in (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). If I flag (9,8), that's one, but (8,8) and (8,9) must be safe. Alternatively, maybe (8,9) is a bomb. But (8,9) is adjacent to (8,8), which is 1. So if (8,9) is a bomb, (8,8) would have one bomb, which is correct. But then (9,9) would have two bombs: (8,9) and (9,8). That would make (9,9) have two bombs, but it's a 1, which is incorrect. So (9,9) can't have two bombs. Therefore, (9,8) must be the only bomb adjacent to (9,9). So I can safely flag (9,8).\n\nSo, I think flagging (9,8) is a safe move. It satisfies (9,9) and (8,7). \n\nBut wait, (8,7) is 1, so if (9,8) is a bomb, that's one, so no other bombs around (8,7). So (8,7)'s other adjacent cells must be safe. \n\nSo, I think flagging (9,8) is a good move. It's a corner cell, and it's adjacent to two numbers that need one bomb each. \n\nSo, my next move would be to flag (9,8).\n</think>\n\nThe cell (9,8) is adjacent to two numbers, (9,9) and (8,7), each requiring one bomb. Flagging (9,8) satisfies both without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nMOVE: 9,8,flag", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n1 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n2 . . . . 2 _ 1 1 2 1\n3 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n4 . . 2 2 2 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . . 2 2 . 1 _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n8 . . . 1 1 1 1 . 1 _\n9 . . . . . . . . 1 _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 8, "y": 9, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current board state. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left with 10 flags remaining. I need to place flags on the bombs or reveal safe squares without hitting a bomb.\n\nLooking at the board, I see a lot of numbers and some empty spaces. My first step is to check all the revealed numbers and their adjacent flags to see if there are any conflicts or obvious placements.\n\nStarting from the top-left, I notice that in row 0, columns 4 and 6 have a '1'. Let's look at position (0,4). It's a '1', so it should have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). Currently, I don't see any flags around it, so maybe there's a bomb nearby. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nMoving to (0,6), it's a '1' as well. The adjacent squares are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). Again, no flags here, so perhaps a bomb is in one of these.\n\nLooking at row 1, positions (1,4) and (1,6) are both '1's. Their adjacent squares might have bombs. For (1,4), the adjacent squares include (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). I don't see any flags here, so maybe a bomb is in one of these.\n\nIn row 2, position (2,4) is a '2'. That means there are two bombs in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). I need to check if any of these have flags or revealed bombs.\n\nWait, looking at (2,4) as '2', and considering the adjacent squares, perhaps the bombs are in (3,3) and (3,5)? Or maybe (1,4) and (1,5)? Hmm, but (1,4) is a '1', so it can't have two bombs. So maybe (3,3) and (3,5) are bombs.\n\nBut let me check other areas. In row 3, position (3,4) is a '1'. Its adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Since (2,4) is '2', which needs two bombs, maybe (3,3) and (3,5) are bombs, which would satisfy both (2,4) and (3,4).\n\nWait, if (3,3) is a bomb, then (2,3) would be adjacent to it, but (2,3) is a '.' so it's unexplored. Similarly, (3,5) is a bomb, then (2,5) is a '1', which would have that bomb as one of its adjacent bombs. So that makes sense.\n\nBut let me think again. If (3,3) and (3,5) are bombs, then (2,4) is satisfied with two bombs, and (3,4) is satisfied with one bomb. That seems to fit.\n\nNow, looking at row 4, position (4,2) is a '2'. Its adjacent squares are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). I know (3,3) is a potential bomb, so that's one. So the other bomb for (4,2) must be somewhere else. Maybe (5,3) or (3,2) or (4,1). But (4,1) is a '.', so maybe (5,3) is a bomb.\n\nWait, but (5,3) is a '.', so I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe (3,2) is a bomb. Let's check if (3,2) is a bomb. If it is, then (4,2) would have two bombs: (3,2) and (3,3). That fits. So perhaps (3,2) is a bomb.\n\nBut wait, (3,2) is in row 3, column 2. Let me check the adjacent numbers. For example, (2,2) is a '.', so it's unexplored. (4,2) is a '2', which we've considered. (3,1) is a '.', (3,3) is a potential bomb. So if (3,2) is a bomb, that would help satisfy (4,2)'s '2'.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me look elsewhere.\n\nIn row 2, position (2,5) is a '1'. Its adjacent squares are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). Since (2,4) is a '2' and (3,5) is a potential bomb, that could be the one bomb for (2,5)'s '1'.\n\nWait, but (2,5) is '1', so only one bomb in its adjacent squares. If (3,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy it. So that seems possible.\n\nMoving to row 6, position (6,3) is a '2'. Its adjacent squares are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). I don't see any flags here, so maybe there are bombs in (5,3) and (7,3) or something like that.\n\nWait, but (5,3) is a '.', so it's unexplored. (7,3) is a '.', so maybe that's a bomb. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 7, position (7,6) is a '1'. Its adjacent squares are (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). I don't see any flags here, so perhaps a bomb is in one of these squares.\n\nBut maybe I should focus on areas where the numbers are already giving me clues.\n\nLooking back at row 2, position (2,4) is a '2'. We thought (3,3) and (3,5) might be bombs. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf (3,3) is a bomb, then (2,3) would be adjacent to it. (2,3) is a '.', so it's unexplored. Similarly, (3,5) is a potential bomb, which would affect (2,5)'s '1' and (4,5)'s '.'.\n\nWait, (4,5) is a '.', so it's unexplored. So if (3,5) is a bomb, then (4,5) would be adjacent to it, but since (4,5) is '.', it's either safe or a bomb. But since (2,5) is '1', which needs one bomb, and if (3,5) is a bomb, that fits.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for areas where the numbers are more constrained.\n\nLooking at row 5, position (5,5) is a '1'. Its adjacent squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). I don't see any flags here, so perhaps a bomb is in one of these squares.\n\nWait, (4,4) is a '2', which has adjacent squares (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). If (3,3) and (3,5) are bombs, that would satisfy (4,4)'s '2'.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me try to find a spot where placing a flag would satisfy the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3, position (3,4) is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). If (3,3) and (3,5) are bombs, that would give (3,4) two bombs, which contradicts the '1'. So that can't be right. So maybe only one of them is a bomb.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If (3,4) is '1', then only one bomb in its adjacent squares. But if (2,4) is '2', which needs two bombs, perhaps (3,3) and (4,3) are bombs. Let me check.\n\nIf (3,3) is a bomb, then (2,3) is adjacent, which is a '.', so it's unexplored. (3,3) would also be adjacent to (4,3), which is a '2' in row 4, column 3. So (4,3) is a '2', which needs two bombs. So if (3,3) is a bomb, that's one. Then another bomb could be (3,5), which would make (4,3)'s '2' satisfied.\n\nBut then, for (3,4)'s '1', if (3,3) is a bomb, that's one, and if (3,5) is also a bomb, that would make two bombs adjacent to (3,4), which would contradict the '1'. So that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps only one of (3,3) or (3,5) is a bomb.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a spot where I can be certain.\n\nLooking at row 4, position (4,2) is a '2'. Its adjacent squares are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). If I can find two bombs here, that would help.\n\nIf (3,3) is a bomb, that's one. Then another bomb could be (5,3), which is a '.', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, (3,2) could be a bomb, which would be adjacent to (4,2)'s '2'.\n\nWait, but (3,2) is a '.', so it's unexplored. If I flag (3,2), that would satisfy (4,2)'s '2' if (3,3) is also a bomb. But I don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, position (5,5) is a '1'. Its adjacent squares include (4,4), which is a '2'. If (4,4) is a '2', it needs two bombs. So perhaps (5,5) is a bomb, which would be one for (4,4)'s '2'. Then another bomb could be (3,4), but (3,4) is a '.', so that's possible.\n\nWait, but (3,4) is a '.', so if it's a bomb, then (4,4)'s '2' would have (3,4) and maybe (3,3) as bombs. But earlier I thought (3,3) might be a bomb, but that caused a conflict with (3,4)'s '1'.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a spot where the numbers clearly indicate a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 6, position (6,3) is a '2'. Its adjacent squares are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). If I can find two bombs here, that would help.\n\nIf (5,3) is a bomb, that's one. Then maybe (7,3) is another. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, (5,3) is a '.', so it's unexplored. If I flag (5,3), that would be one bomb for (6,3)'s '2'. Then maybe (7,3) is another.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should look for a spot where the numbers are more constrained.\n\nLooking at row 9, position (9,9) is a '1'. Its adjacent squares are (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). Since (8,9) is a '1', which is adjacent to (9,9), so maybe (9,9) is a bomb, but that would make (8,9)'s '1' have one bomb, which is correct. But (9,9) is a '1', so it needs one bomb adjacent. So if (8,9) is a bomb, that would satisfy (9,9)'s '1', and (8,9) is a '1', so it needs one bomb, which could be (9,9). But that would mean both (8,9) and (9,9) are bombs, but that would make (8,9)'s '1' have two bombs, which is incorrect. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, so if (9,9) is a bomb, then (8,9) would have (9,9) as a bomb, which would satisfy its '1'. But (9,9) is a '1', which needs one bomb adjacent, which would be (8,9). But if (8,9) is a bomb, then (9,9) is a '1', which is correct. But then (8,9) is a '1', which would have (9,9) as a bomb, which is correct. So that could work.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again. If (8,9) is a bomb, then (9,9) is a '1', which is correct. And (8,9) is a '1', which would have (9,9) as a bomb, which is correct. So that seems possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the only possibility. Let me check other areas.\n\nLooking at row 8, position (8,8) is a '1'. Its adjacent squares are (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). If (8,9) is a bomb, that would satisfy (8,8)'s '1'. So that could be the case.\n\nSo perhaps (8,9) is a bomb, which would satisfy both (8,8)'s '1' and (9,9)'s '1'. That seems plausible.\n\nSo if I flag (8,9), that would be one bomb, and (9,9) would have that as its adjacent bomb, which fits. And (8,8) would have (8,9) as its bomb, which fits. So that seems like a good spot to flag.\n\nBut wait, (8,9) is a '1', so if I flag it as a bomb, that would make sense. So I think I should flag (8,9) as a bomb.\n\nBut let me double-check. If (8,9) is a bomb, then (7,9) is a '1', which would have (8,9) as a bomb, which is correct. (7,9) is a '1', so it needs one bomb, which would be (8,9). That works.\n\nSo yes, flagging (8,9) as a bomb seems correct.\n\nWait, but (8,9) is a '1', so if I flag it as a bomb, that would make sense because it's showing '1' but it's actually a bomb. Wait, no, in Minesweeper, the numbers show the count of adjacent bombs. So if (8,9) is a bomb, then (7,9) would have (8,9) as a bomb, which would make (7,9)'s '1' correct. And (8,8) would have (8,9) as a bomb, making its '1' correct. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo I think I should place a flag at (8,9). That would be a safe move because it fits with the numbers around it.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other spots where I can be certain. For example, looking at row 2, position (2,4) is a '2'. If I can find two bombs adjacent to it, that would help.\n\nIf (3,3) and (3,5) are bombs, that would give (2,4) two bombs, which fits. But earlier I thought that might conflict with (3,4)'s '1'. Let me check again.\n\nIf (3,3) is a bomb, then (3,4)'s '1' would have (3,3) as a bomb, which is correct. Then (3,5) is a '.', so if it's a bomb, that would give (2,4) two bombs, which is correct. But then (3,4)'s '1' would have only (3,3) as a bomb, which is correct. So that could work.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should flag (3,5) as a bomb. But I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, position (4,2) is a '2'. If (3,3) and (5,3) are bombs, that would satisfy it. But I'm not sure.\n\nHmm, maybe I should focus on the bottom-right corner where I found (8,9) as a potential bomb. That seems more certain because it fits with the numbers around it.\n\nSo I think I'll place a flag at (8,9). That should be a safe move.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Position (8,9) is a '1', indicating exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. By flagging (8,9), it satisfies the '1's in (7,9) and (8,8) as they each have only one adjacent flag, which aligns with their '1' values.\n\nMOVE: 8,9,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n1 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n2 . . . . 2 _ 1 1 2 1\n3 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n4 . . 2 2 2 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . . 2 2 . 1 _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n8 . . . 1 1 1 1 . 1 _\n9 . . . . . . . . 1 _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 5, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let's start by looking at the board state and the information provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total, with 9 flags remaining. That means there's one more bomb that hasn't been flagged yet, or maybe some flags are incorrectly placed.\n\nLooking at the board, I see a lot of numbers and some flags. The coordinate system is such that x is the row number, and y is the column number, both starting from 0 at the top and left, respectively.\n\nI should start by analyzing the numbers and their surrounding flags to see if there are any conflicts or if I can deduce where the bombs are.\n\nFirst, let's check each number and see how many flags are adjacent to them. If a number is 1, it should have exactly one flag around it. If it's 2, it should have two flags, and so on. If I find any discrepancies, that might indicate a wrong flag or a safe spot to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 4 (0,4) is a 1. Let's check its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (0,4) itself. Wait, no, the adjacent squares for (0,4) would be (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (0,4) is the center. So, around (0,4), which is a 1, I should check for flags.\n\nLooking at (0,4), the adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,3): It's a '.', so unexplored.\n- (0,5): It's a '1', so a number.\n- (1,3): It's a '.', so unexplored.\n- (1,4): It's a '1'.\n- (1,5): It's a '1'.\n- (0,4) itself is the number.\n\nWait, but (0,4) is a 1, so it should have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. Let me check the surrounding squares for any flags or revealed bombs.\n\nLooking at (0,4), the adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,3): Unexplored.\n- (0,5): Number 1.\n- (1,3): Unexplored.\n- (1,4): Number 1.\n- (1,5): Number 1.\n\nHmm, none of these are flags yet. So, the 1 at (0,4) must have one bomb in these surrounding squares. But since all these squares are either numbers or unexplored, I can't immediately deduce where the bomb is.\n\nLet me check another number. How about row 2, column 4 (2,4), which is a 2. Let's see its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent to (2,4):\n\n- (1,3): Unexplored.\n- (1,4): Number 1.\n- (1,5): Number 1.\n- (2,3): Number 2.\n- (2,5): Number 1.\n- (3,3): Unexplored.\n- (3,4): Number 1.\n- (3,5): Unexplored.\n\nSo, the number 2 at (2,4) needs exactly two bombs in these surrounding squares. Let's see if there are any flags already placed here. I don't see any flags in these adjacent squares. So, the two bombs must be among the unexplored squares around (2,4). That could be (1,3), (3,3), (3,5), etc.\n\nMoving on, let's check row 3, column 4 (3,4), which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,3): Number 2.\n- (2,4): Number 2.\n- (2,5): Number 1.\n- (3,3): Unexplored.\n- (3,5): Unexplored.\n- (4,3): Number 2.\n- (4,4): Number 2.\n- (4,5): Number 1.\n\nSo, the 1 at (3,4) needs exactly one bomb in these surrounding squares. Since (2,3) is a 2, which is a number, it's not a bomb. Similarly, (2,4) is a 2, so not a bomb. (2,5) is a 1, which isn't a bomb either. So, the bomb must be in one of the unexplored squares around (3,4): (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). But (4,3) is a 2, so that's a number, not a bomb. (4,4) is a 2, same thing. (4,5) is a 1. So, the bomb must be either at (3,3) or (3,5). But since (2,4) is a 2, which needs two bombs around it, and one of them is likely (3,4), but wait, (3,4) is a 1, which is a number, not a bomb. So, perhaps the bombs are at (3,3) and (3,5). But that would make two bombs, which would satisfy the 2 at (2,4). But the 1 at (3,4) would require only one bomb in its adjacent squares. So, if (3,3) is a bomb, then (3,4)'s adjacent squares include (3,3) which would be a bomb, but (3,5) would not be a bomb, but that's conflicting because (2,4) is a 2, which needs two bombs.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The 2 at (2,4) needs two bombs in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,3): Unexplored.\n- (1,4): 1.\n- (1,5): 1.\n- (2,3): 2.\n- (2,5): 1.\n- (3,3): Unexplored.\n- (3,4): 1.\n- (3,5): Unexplored.\n\nSo, the two bombs must be among (1,3), (3,3), (3,5). Because (1,4) and (1,5) are numbers, not bombs. Similarly, (2,3) is a number, so not a bomb. (2,5) is a 1, so not a bomb. (3,4) is a 1, so not a bomb. So, the two bombs must be in (1,3), (3,3), or (3,5).\n\nBut the 1 at (3,4) needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares to (3,4) are:\n\n- (2,3): 2.\n- (2,4): 2.\n- (2,5): 1.\n- (3,3): Unexplored.\n- (3,5): Unexplored.\n- (4,3): 2.\n- (4,4): 2.\n- (4,5): 1.\n\nSo, the 1 at (3,4) must have exactly one bomb in these surrounding squares. The possible bombs are in (3,3) or (3,5), as those are unexplored. So, if (3,3) is a bomb, that would satisfy the 1 at (3,4). But then, the 2 at (2,4) would need another bomb, which could be (3,5). Alternatively, if (3,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy the 1 at (3,4), and (3,3) would be the other bomb for (2,4). But I don't see any flags yet, so maybe I can place flags here.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't placed any flags yet except for (8,9) which is F. So, I need to see where the potential bombs are.\n\nAnother area to look at is row 8, column 9 (8,9), which is already flagged. Let's check the surrounding numbers. The 1 at (8,8) is adjacent to (8,9), which is a flag. So, that 1 is satisfied because it has one flag. Similarly, the 1 at (7,9) is adjacent to (8,9), so that's also satisfied.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 8 (8,8), which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (7,7): Unexplored.\n- (7,8): 1.\n- (7,9): 1.\n- (8,7): Unexplored.\n- (8,9): Flagged.\n- (9,7): Unexplored.\n- (9,8): Unexplored.\n- (9,9): 1.\n\nSo, the 1 at (8,8) has one flag at (8,9), so that's correct. No conflicts here.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4 (5,4), which is a '.', so unexplored. Wait, no, row 5, column 4 is a '.', but row 5, column 5 is a 1. Let me check the 1 at (5,5). Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,4): 2.\n- (4,5): 1.\n- (4,6): Unexplored.\n- (5,4): '.'.\n- (5,6): Unexplored.\n- (6,4): '.'.\n- (6,5): 1.\n- (6,6): Unexplored.\n\nHmm, not much here. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 8 (6,8), which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,7): '.'.\n- (5,8): '.'.\n- (5,9): '.'.\n- (6,7): '.'.\n- (6,9): '.'.\n- (7,7): '.'.\n- (7,8): '.'.\n- (7,9): 1.\n\nSo, the 1 at (6,8) has one bomb in its adjacent squares. The only adjacent number is (7,9), which is a 1, but that's a number, not a bomb. So, the bomb must be in one of the unexplored squares around (6,8). But without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nLet me check the bottom-right area. Row 9, column 9 is a 1. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (8,8): 1.\n- (8,9): Flag.\n- (9,8): '.'.\n\nSo, the 1 at (9,9) has one flag at (8,9), so that's satisfied. No conflict here.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 7 (8,7), which is a '.', so unexplored. The 1 at (8,6) is adjacent to (8,7). Let me check (8,6): it's a '.', so unexplored. Wait, no, row 8, column 6 is a '.', and row 8, column 7 is a '.'.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 4, column 4 (4,4), which is a 2. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (3,3): '.'.\n- (3,4): 1.\n- (3,5): '.'.\n- (4,3): 2.\n- (4,5): 1.\n- (5,3): 2.\n- (5,4): '.'.\n- (5,5): 1.\n\nSo, the 2 at (4,4) needs two bombs in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5). But (4,3) is a 2, which is a number, so not a bomb. (4,5) is a 1, so not a bomb. (5,3) is a 2, so not a bomb. (5,5) is a 1, so not a bomb. So, the bombs must be at (3,3) and (3,5). That makes sense because (3,3) and (3,5) are unexplored. So, placing flags at (3,3) and (3,5) would satisfy the 2 at (4,4).\n\nWait, but if I place flags at (3,3) and (3,5), that would give the 2 at (4,4) exactly two bombs, which is correct. Also, the 1 at (3,4) would have one bomb at (3,3) or (3,5). So, that could work.\n\nBut let me check if placing flags at (3,3) and (3,5) would cause any conflicts elsewhere. For example, the 2 at (2,4) needs two bombs. If (3,3) is a bomb, that's one, and perhaps (3,5) is the other. That would satisfy both the 2 at (2,4) and the 2 at (4,4). Also, the 1 at (3,4) would have one bomb, either (3,3) or (3,5), which is correct.\n\nSo, placing flags at (3,3) and (3,5) seems logical. But I can only place one flag at a time, so I need to decide which one to place first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a spot where I can safely reveal a square because all possible bombs are already flagged.\n\nWait, looking at row 3, column 4 (3,4), which is a 1. If I assume that (3,3) is a bomb, then that satisfies the 1 at (3,4). But if (3,5) is also a bomb, that would give two bombs adjacent to (3,4), which is a 1, which is incorrect. So, that can't be. Wait, no, because (3,4) is a 1, it can only have one bomb adjacent. So, if I place a flag at (3,3), that would satisfy the 1 at (3,4). But then, the 2 at (2,4) would need another bomb. So, perhaps (3,5) is the other bomb.\n\nBut if I place a flag at (3,3), that would satisfy the 1 at (3,4), and then the 2 at (2,4) would need another bomb, which could be at (3,5). So, placing a flag at (3,3) would be a safe move because it doesn't conflict with any numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 2, column 5 (2,5), which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,4): 1.\n- (1,5): 1.\n- (1,6): '.'.\n- (2,4): 2.\n- (2,6): '.'.\n- (3,4): 1.\n- (3,5): '.'.\n- (3,6): '.'.\n\nSo, the 1 at (2,5) needs one bomb in these squares. The only adjacent number is (1,4) and (1,5), which are 1s, so they can't be bombs. So, the bomb must be in (3,5). Therefore, placing a flag at (3,5) would satisfy the 1 at (2,5). That seems like a solid deduction.\n\nSo, if I place a flag at (3,5), that would mean the 1 at (2,5) is satisfied. Additionally, the 2 at (2,4) would have one bomb at (3,5), and it needs another bomb. The other bomb could be at (3,3). So, placing a flag at (3,5) seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 2, column 6 (2,6), which is a 2. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,5): 1.\n- (1,6): '.'.\n- (1,7): '.'.\n- (2,5): 1.\n- (2,7): '.'.\n- (3,5): '.'.\n- (3,6): '.'.\n- (3,7): '.'.\n\nWait, no, row 2, column 6 is a 2. So, it needs two bombs in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,5): 1.\n- (1,6): '.'.\n- (1,7): '.'.\n- (2,5): 1.\n- (2,7): '.'.\n- (3,5): '.'.\n- (3,6): '.'.\n- (3,7): '.'.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me recount. For (2,6):\n\n- (1,5): 1.\n- (1,6): '.'.\n- (1,7): '.'.\n- (2,5): 1.\n- (2,7): '.'.\n- (3,5): '.'.\n- (3,6): '.'.\n- (3,7): '.'.\n\nSo, the 2 at (2,6) needs two bombs in these squares. The only numbers are (1,5) and (2,5), which are 1s, so they can't be bombs. So, the bombs must be in (1,6), (1,7), (3,5), (3,6), or (3,7). But without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at row 4, column 3 (4,3), which is a 2. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (3,2): '.'.\n- (3,3): '.'.\n- (3,4): 1.\n- (4,2): '.'.\n- (4,4): 2.\n- (5,2): '.'.\n- (5,3): 2.\n- (5,4): '.'.\n\nSo, the 2 at (4,3) needs two bombs in these squares. The adjacent numbers are (3,4) which is a 1, (4,4) which is a 2, and (5,3) which is a 2. So, the bombs must be in (3,2), (3,3), (5,2), etc. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at row 2, column 4 (2,4), which is a 2. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,3): '.'.\n- (1,4): 1.\n- (1,5): 1.\n- (2,3): 2.\n- (2,5): 1.\n- (3,3): '.'.\n- (3,4): 1.\n- (3,5): '.'.\n\nSo, the 2 at (2,4) needs two bombs. The possible squares are (1,3), (3,3), (3,5). Since (1,3) is unexplored, and (3,3) and (3,5) are unexplored.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that placing a flag at (3,5) would satisfy the 1 at (2,5). So, if I place a flag at (3,5), that would be one bomb for (2,4). Then, the other bomb for (2,4) must be at (1,3) or (3,3). But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 5, column 4 (5,4), which is a '.', so unexplored. The 1 at (5,5) is adjacent to (5,4). So, if (5,4) is a bomb, that would satisfy the 1 at (5,5). But I don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, column 4 (3,4), which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,3): 2.\n- (2,4): 2.\n- (2,5): 1.\n- (3,3): '.'.\n- (3,5): '.'.\n- (4,3): 2.\n- (4,4): 2.\n- (4,5): 1.\n\nSo, the 1 at (3,4) needs one bomb in these squares. The possible bombs are (3,3) or (3,5). If I place a flag at (3,5), that would satisfy the 1 at (3,4) and also satisfy the 1 at (2,5). So, that seems like a good candidate.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 2, column 5 (2,5), which is a 1. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,4): 1.\n- (1,5): 1.\n- (1,6): '.'.\n- (2,4): 2.\n- (2,6): '.'.\n- (3,4): 1.\n- (3,5): '.'.\n- (3,6): '.'.\n\nSo, the 1 at (2,5) needs one bomb in these squares. The possible bombs are (3,5) because it's adjacent. So, placing a flag at (3,5) would satisfy the 1 at (2,5).\n\nTherefore, I think placing a flag at (3,5) is a safe move because it doesn't conflict with any numbers and satisfies the 1 at (2,5). Additionally, it would help in determining the 2 at (2,4) and the 2 at (4,4).\n\nSo, my next move would be to place a flag at (3,5).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The square at (3,5) is adjacent to the 1 at (2,5), satisfying the requirement. Additionally, it helps in determining the placement of bombs for the 2 at (2,4) and the 2 at (4,4) without causing any conflicts.\n\nMOVE: 3,5,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n1 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n2 . . . . 2 _ 1 1 2 1\n3 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n4 . . 2 2 2 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . . 2 2 . 1 _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n8 . . . 1 1 1 1 . 1 F\n9 . . . . . . . . 1 _", "sucess": true}

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 8 flags left and 10 bombs in total. So, we've already placed some flags, and we need to place 2 more to reach 10. But I need to be careful where I place them.\n\nLooking at the board, I see several numbers and some flags. The legend tells me that '.' is unexplored, '_' is empty revealed, 'F' is flagged, and numbers 1-8 indicate adjacent bombs.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the numbers and their surrounding flags to see if there are any obvious placements or conflicts.\n\nLet's check row 0. At (0,4), there's a '1'. The adjacent squares around it are:\n- (0,3): '.', (0,5): '_', (1,3): '.', (1,4): '.', (1,5): '_', (0,4) itself is '1'.\nWait, maybe I should look at all 8 surrounding squares. So, (0,4) has:\n- (0,3): '.', (0,5): '_', (1,3): '.', (1,4): '.', (1,5): '_', (0,4) is '1', but I think I'm missing some. Wait, the 8 surrounding squares are (x-1,y-1) to (x+1,y+1). So for (0,4), the adjacent squares are:\n- (-1,3): out of bounds, so ignore.\n- (-1,4): out of bounds.\n- (-1,5): out of bounds.\n- (0,3): '.', (0,5): '_', (1,3): '.', (1,4): '.', (1,5): '_'.\n\nWait, that's not right. For (0,4), the adjacent squares are:\n- (0-1,4-1) = (-1,3) invalid\n- (0-1,4) = (-1,4) invalid\n- (0-1,4+1) = (-1,5) invalid\n- (0,4-1) = (0,3): '.'\n- (0,4+1) = (0,5): '_'\n- (0+1,4-1) = (1,3): '.'\n- (1,4): '.' (but in the board, (1,4) is '1'? Wait, looking back, row 1, column 4 is '1' as per the board.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The board shows row 0: . . . . 1 _ 1 . . ., so (0,4) is '1'. Then row 1: . . . . 1 _ 1 . . ., so (1,4) is '1'. So for (0,4), the adjacent squares are:\n- (0,3): '.', (0,5): '_', (1,3): '.', (1,4): '1', (1,5): '_'.\n\nWait, but (1,4) is '1', which is another number. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the '1' at (0,4) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. Let me check the adjacent squares again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for squares where the number is already satisfied by existing flags, or where there's a conflict.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4: it's '2'. The adjacent squares are:\n- (1,3): '.', (1,4): '1', (1,5): '_', (2,3): '.', (2,5): '1', (3,3): '.', (3,4): '1', (3,5): '_'.\n\nWait, but (2,4) is '2', so it needs two bombs in its adjacent squares. Let's see how many flags are around it. I don't see any flags around (2,4) yet. So maybe that's a clue.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for squares where the number is already met by flags, meaning the other adjacent squares are safe. Or where the number is not met, so more flags are needed.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 9: it's 'F', so a flag. That's a potential bomb. But I need to see if that aligns with the numbers around it.\n\nWait, let's check the '2' at (2,4). It needs two bombs in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are:\n- (1,3): '.', (1,4): '1', (1,5): '_', (2,3): '.', (2,5): '1', (3,3): '.', (3,4): '1', (3,5): '_'.\n\nWait, (1,4) is '1', which needs one bomb. (2,5) is '1', which needs one bomb. (3,4) is '1', which needs one bomb. So each of these '1's needs one bomb in their adjacent squares.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a spot where the number is already satisfied by flags, so I can safely reveal the other squares.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 8: it's '1'. The adjacent squares are:\n- (7,7): '1', (7,8): '1', (7,9): 'F', (8,7): '1', (8,9): 'F', (9,7): '.', (9,8): '.', (9,9): '_'.\n\nWait, (8,8) is '1', so it needs one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares include (7,9): 'F' and (8,9): 'F'. So that's two flags, but the number is '1', which means only one bomb should be adjacent. That's a conflict because if both (7,9) and (8,9) are flags, that would mean two bombs, but the '1' at (8,8) can only have one. So this suggests that at least one of those flags is incorrect.\n\nWait, but (8,9) is 'F', and (7,9) is 'F' as well. So the '1' at (8,8) is adjacent to two flags, which would mean two bombs, but the number is '1', which is a conflict. So one of those flags must be wrong. So perhaps one of them is not a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the other squares around (8,8) is a bomb. Let's see: the adjacent squares are (7,7): '1', (7,8): '1', (7,9): 'F', (8,7): '1', (8,9): 'F', (9,7): '.', (9,8): '.', (9,9): '_'.\n\nWait, (7,7) is '1', which needs one bomb. (7,8) is '1', which also needs one bomb. (8,7) is '1', which needs one bomb. So each of these '1's needs one bomb in their adjacent squares.\n\nBut if (8,9) is a flag, that's one bomb. If (7,9) is a flag, that's another. But the '1' at (8,8) can only have one bomb, so one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bombs are elsewhere. Let's see: the '1' at (8,8) is adjacent to (7,9) and (8,9), both flags, which would mean two bombs, but the number is '1'. So that's a conflict. Therefore, at least one of those flags must be wrong.\n\nSo perhaps one of those flags is not a bomb. Let's see if there's a way to determine which one.\n\nLooking at (7,9): it's a flag. The adjacent squares for (7,9) include (6,8): '1', (6,9): '1', (7,8): '1', (8,8): '1', (8,9): 'F'.\n\nWait, (6,8) is '1', which needs one bomb. If (7,9) is a bomb, then (6,8)'s adjacent bombs would include (7,8): '1' and (7,9): 'F' (bomb). But (6,8) is '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (7,9) is a bomb, then (6,8) would have two bombs: (7,8) is '1' (which is a number, not a bomb), and (7,9) is a bomb. So that's only one bomb, which is okay. Wait, no: (6,8) is '1', so it needs one bomb in its adjacent squares. If (7,9) is a bomb, then (6,8) would have (7,8): '1' (not a bomb), (7,9): 'F' (bomb), and (6,9): '1' (not a bomb). So that's one bomb, which satisfies the '1' at (6,8).\n\nSimilarly, (7,8) is '1', which needs one bomb. If (7,9) is a bomb, then (7,8) would have (7,9): 'F' (bomb), (6,8): '1', (6,9): '1', (8,8): '1', (8,9): 'F'. So (7,8)'s adjacent bombs would be (7,9) and (8,9), which are two bombs. But (7,8) is '1', so that's a conflict because it would have two bombs, but it's showing '1'.\n\nAh, that's a problem. So if (7,9) is a bomb, then (7,8) would have two bombs, which contradicts the '1' at (7,8). Therefore, (7,9) cannot be a bomb. So the flag at (7,9) is incorrect. Therefore, I should remove that flag.\n\nWait, but the flag at (7,9) is part of the board state, so it's already placed. So perhaps I should remove it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the flag at (8,9) is the incorrect one.\n\nWait, let's check the '1' at (7,8). It needs one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are:\n- (6,7): '.', (6,8): '1', (6,9): '1', (7,7): '1', (7,9): 'F', (8,7): '1', (8,8): '1', (8,9): 'F'.\n\nSo, the adjacent squares include two flags: (7,9) and (8,9). If both are bombs, then (7,8) would have two bombs, which contradicts the '1'. Therefore, only one of them can be a bomb, and the other is a false flag.\n\nSimilarly, the '1' at (8,8) is adjacent to (7,9) and (8,9). So if (8,8) is '1', then only one of those can be a bomb. So perhaps one of the flags is incorrect.\n\nLooking at the board, the flags are at (3,5): 'F', (8,9): 'F', and (8,8): '1' (wait, no, (8,8) is '1', not a flag). Wait, the flags are at (3,5), (8,9), and (9,9) is '_', so no flag there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for other numbers that are already satisfied.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 9: it's '1'. The adjacent squares are:\n- (8,8): '1', (8,9): 'F', (9,8): '.', (9,9): '_'.\n\nWait, (9,9) is '_', which is an empty revealed space, so no bomb. So (9,9) is safe. So the '1' at (9,9) must have one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are (8,8): '1', (8,9): 'F', (9,8): '.', (9,9) itself is '_'.\n\nWait, no, (9,9) is '_', which is an empty square, so it's safe. So the '1' at (9,9) must have one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are (8,8): '1', (8,9): 'F', (9,8): '.', (9,9): '_'. Wait, no, (9,9) is the square itself, so the adjacent squares are (8,8), (8,9), (9,8), and (9,10), which is out of bounds. So (8,8) is '1', (8,9) is 'F', and (9,8) is '.'.\n\nSo the '1' at (9,9) needs one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are (8,8): '1', (8,9): 'F', (9,8): '.'.\n\nSo (8,9) is a flag, which would count as a bomb. So that's one bomb. But (8,8) is '1', which is a number, not a bomb. So the '1' at (9,9) is satisfied because (8,9) is a bomb. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but earlier, the '1' at (8,8) is adjacent to (8,9): 'F' and (7,9): 'F'. So that's two bombs, which would make the '1' at (8,8) have two bombs, which is a conflict.\n\nSo, the '1' at (8,8) can only have one bomb in its adjacent squares. But currently, it's adjacent to two flags, which would mean two bombs, which is a conflict. Therefore, one of those flags must be incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps the flag at (7,9) is incorrect. Because if (7,9) is a bomb, then (8,8) would have two bombs, which is a conflict. So perhaps (7,9) is not a bomb, and the flag there is incorrect. So I should remove that flag.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (8,9) is the correct bomb, and (7,9) is not. So, perhaps the flag at (7,9) is wrong and should be removed.\n\nSo, perhaps the next move is to remove the flag at (7,9), as it's causing a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag at (8,9) is correct, and the flag at (7,9) is incorrect.\n\nSo, to resolve this conflict, I should remove the flag at (7,9).\n\nWait, but let me check other numbers to see if this affects them.\n\nIf I remove the flag at (7,9), then the '1' at (7,8) would have only one bomb adjacent, which is (8,9): 'F'. That would satisfy the '1' at (7,8).\n\nSimilarly, the '1' at (8,8) would have one bomb at (8,9), which is correct.\n\nSo, removing the flag at (7,9) would resolve the conflict.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag at (8,9) is incorrect, but that would affect the '1' at (9,9), which needs one bomb, which would be satisfied by (8,9) being a bomb.\n\nWait, if I remove the flag at (7,9), then the '1' at (9,9) would still have (8,9) as a bomb, which is correct.\n\nSo, the conflict is that the '1' at (8,8) is adjacent to two flags, which would mean two bombs, which is incorrect. So, one of those flags must be wrong. So, perhaps the flag at (7,9) is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the next move would be to remove the flag at (7,9).\n\nSo, the move would be to place a flag as false (i.e., remove it). So, the move would be x=7, y=9, flag=false.\n\nWait, but the format is MOVE: x,y,flag, where flag is true to place a flag, false to reveal or remove a flag. So, to remove the flag at (7,9), I would set flag=false.\n\nBut wait, the flag is already placed at (7,9). So, to remove it, I need to make a move at (7,9) with flag=true? Wait, no: the rule says, \"To remove a flag, make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\" Wait, no, the rules say: \"To remove a flag, make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the rules say: \"To remove a flag, make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\" Wait, that's not correct. Normally, in Minesweeper, you place a flag by right-clicking, and you remove it by right-clicking again. So, in this case, to remove a flag, you would make a move at (x,y) with flag=true, which would toggle the flag off.\n\nWait, but the initial state has (7,9) as 'F', so to remove it, I would make a move at (7,9) with flag=true, which would remove the flag.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact move syntax. The user said: \"To remove a flag, make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\" So, yes, to remove a flag, you set flag=true on a square that's already flagged.\n\nSo, the move would be x=7, y=9, flag=true, which would remove the flag at (7,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag at (8,9) is correct, and the flag at (7,9) is incorrect, so removing (7,9) would resolve the conflict.\n\nSo, the next move is to remove the flag at (7,9).\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other conflicts.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 9: 'F'. The adjacent squares include (8,8): '1', which is a problem because (8,8) is '1', and if (8,9) is a bomb, then (8,8) would have one bomb, which is correct. But (7,9) is also a flag, so (8,8) would have two bombs, which is a conflict.\n\nTherefore, to resolve this, either (7,9) or (8,9) must not be a bomb. But since (8,9) is adjacent to (9,9)'s '1', which needs one bomb, which would be satisfied by (8,9). So, if (8,9) is a bomb, then (9,9)'s '1' is satisfied. But then (8,8)'s '1' would have two bombs: (7,9) and (8,9), which is a conflict. So, perhaps (7,9) is not a bomb, so the flag there is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the next move is to remove the flag at (7,9).\n\nSo, the move would be to remove the flag at (7,9), which is x=7, y=9, flag=true (to toggle it off).\n\nWait, but the user's example shows that placing a flag is done by setting flag=true, and revealing is flag=false. So, to remove a flag, you set flag=true on a flagged square, which toggles it to unflagged.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the move is to toggle the flag at (7,9), which would remove it.\n\nSo, the explanation is that the '1' at (8,8) is adjacent to two flags, which is a conflict. Therefore, one of those flags must be incorrect. Since (8,9) is needed to satisfy the '1' at (9,9), the flag at (7,9) is the incorrect one and should be removed.\n\nSo, the move is to remove the flag at (7,9).\n\nAnother possible move is to look for squares that can be safely revealed. For example, looking at row 6, column 6: it's '_', which is empty. The adjacent squares are numbers, so perhaps it's safe.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps looking at row 5, column 6: it's '_', which is empty. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, column 5: it's 'F', which is a flag. The adjacent squares include (3,4): '1', which is a number. So, the '1' at (3,4) needs one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are:\n- (2,3): '.', (2,4): '2', (2,5): '1', (3,3): '.', (3,5): 'F', (4,3): '.', (4,4): '2', (4,5): '1'.\n\nSo, the '1' at (3,4) has one flag at (3,5), which is correct. So that's okay.\n\nAnother area to look at is row 8, column 8: it's '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n- (7,7): '1', (7,8): '1', (7,9): 'F', (8,7): '1', (8,9): 'F', (9,7): '.', (9,8): '.', (9,9): '_'.\n\nWait, the '1' at (8,8) is adjacent to (7,9): 'F' and (8,9): 'F', which would be two bombs, which is a conflict. Therefore, one of those flags must be wrong.\n\nSo, to resolve this, I need to remove one of the flags. Since (8,9) is also adjacent to (9,9)'s '1', which needs one bomb, so (8,9) is likely a bomb, so the flag there is correct. Therefore, the flag at (7,9) is incorrect and should be removed.\n\nTherefore, the move is to remove the flag at (7,9).\n\nSo, the explanation is that the '1' at (8,8) is adjacent to two flags, causing a conflict. Since (8,9) is needed for (9,9)'s '1', the flag at (7,9) must be removed.\n</think>\n\nThe '1' at (8,8) is adjacent to two flags, causing a conflict. Since (8,9) is needed to satisfy the '1' at (9,9), the flag at (7,9) is incorrect and should be removed.\n\nMOVE: 7,9,true", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n1 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n2 . . . . 2 _ 1 1 2 1\n3 . . . . 1 F _ _ _ _\n4 . . 2 2 2 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . . 2 2 . 1 _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n8 . . . 1 1 1 1 . 1 F\n9 . . . . . . . . 1 _", "sucess": true}

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs with 7 flags remaining. So, I need to flag all 10 bombs, but I have to be careful not to flag any safe squares.\n\nLooking at the board, I see a lot of numbers and some flags. Let me start by analyzing the numbers and their surroundings to see if I can find any obvious safe spots or places where bombs must be.\n\nStarting from the top, row 0, column 4 is a '1'. That means there's exactly one bomb in the surrounding 8 squares. Let's check the adjacent squares to see if any are flagged or revealed.\n\nLooking at position (0,4)=1, the adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (0,4) itself is the number. Wait, no, the number is at (0,4), so the adjacent squares would be (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (0,4-1), etc. Wait, maybe I should list all 8 surrounding squares.\n\nFor (0,4)=1, the adjacent squares are:\n- (0,3)\n- (0,5)\n- (1,3)\n- (1,4)\n- (1,5)\n\nBut wait, (0,4) is at the top row, so there's no ( -1, y), so only the squares below and to the sides. So, the adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5).\n\nLooking at these, I see that (0,5) is a '1', (1,4) is a '1', and (1,5) is a '1'. Hmm, but I don't see any flags around (0,4). So, the '1' at (0,4) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nWait, but (0,5) is a '1' as well. Let me check that. For (0,5)=1, the adjacent squares are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,6) is an '_', which is a revealed empty space, so no bomb there. So, the '1' at (0,5) must have one bomb in (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), or (1,6). But (0,4) is a '1' which already needs one bomb, so perhaps the bomb is at (1,5). Because (1,5) is a '1' as well, so maybe that's a flag.\n\nWait, but (1,5) is a '1', so it's a number, not a flag. So, perhaps the bomb is elsewhere. Maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me look for areas where the numbers and flags might give me a clear indication. Maybe the bottom part of the board has more clues.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 9 is a 'F' (flagged). Similarly, row 8, column 9 is a 'F'. So, those are two flags already placed. The total flags remaining are 7, and there are 10 bombs, so 3 bombs are already flagged, and 7 are left to flag.\n\nWait, no, the flags remaining are 7, which means that so far, 3 flags have been placed. Because the total bombs are 10, and flags remaining are 7, so 10 - 7 = 3 flags have been placed. So, there are 3 bombs already flagged, and 7 bombs left to flag.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 5 is a 'F'. So that's one flag. Then row 7,9 and row 8,9 are two more, making a total of 3 flags. So that's correct.\n\nNow, let's look for areas where the numbers can help us deduce the location of bombs.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4 is a '2'. The adjacent squares would be (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Let me check these squares.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4=2, so it needs two bombs around it. Let's see which squares are possible.\n\n(1,3) is '.', (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=2, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=F, (3,5)=_.\n\nWait, (3,4) is a 'F', so that's one bomb. So, the '2' at (2,4) needs one more bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at the other squares: (1,3)=., (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=2, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=_.\n\nHmm, perhaps (3,5) is a bomb? Because (3,5) is '_', which is revealed as empty, so no, it's safe. Wait, no, '_' means empty revealed, so it's safe. So, (3,5) is safe. So, the other possible squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3).\n\nBut (1,4) is a '1', so it needs one bomb around it. Let's see (1,4)=1. Its adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nWait, (2,4)=2, which we've already considered. So, (1,4)=1 needs one bomb in its adjacent squares. Let's see if any are flagged or revealed.\n\nLooking at (0,3)=., (0,4)=1, (0,5)=1, (1,3)=., (1,5)=1, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1.\n\nHmm, none of these are flagged except perhaps (2,3)=2, but that's a number. So, the '1' at (1,4) must have one bomb in these squares. But since (2,4)=2 has (3,4)=F, which is one bomb, maybe the other bomb is elsewhere.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a spot where the numbers clearly indicate a bomb or a safe spot.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 9 is a 'F' and row 8, column 9 is a 'F'. So, those are two flags. Let's check the numbers around these areas.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 8 is '1', and column 9 is 'F'. So, the '1' at (8,8) must have one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). Among these, (7,9)=F and (8,9)=F. So, that's two flags, but the '1' at (8,8) only needs one bomb. So, this seems conflicting because the '1' would have two bombs adjacent if both (7,9) and (8,9) are bombs. But that would make the '1' at (8,8) have two bombs, which is more than the number indicates. So, this suggests that maybe one of these flags is incorrect.\n\nWait, but (7,9)=F and (8,9)=F are both flags. So, according to the '1' at (8,8), only one of these can be a bomb. But both are flagged, which would mean the '1' is wrong, which can't be. So, perhaps one of these flags is incorrect and should be removed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've miscounted the adjacent squares. Let me recount.\n\nThe '1' at (8,8) has the following adjacent squares:\n- (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n- (8,7), (8,9)\n- (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nSo, among these, (7,9)=F and (8,9)=F are both flagged. So, the '1' at (8,8) is indicating that only one of these is a bomb, but both are flagged. That suggests that one of the flags is incorrect. So, perhaps one of these flags should be removed because the '1' can't have two bombs adjacent.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 9=F and row 8, column 9=F. Let me check the numbers around these to see if they can help.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 8 is '1', and column 9 is 'F'. So, the '1' at (7,8) has adjacent squares:\n- (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)\n- (7,7), (7,9)\n- (8,7), (8,8), (8,9)\n\nAgain, (7,9)=F and (8,9)=F are both flagged. So, the '1' at (7,8) would have two bombs adjacent if both are bombs, which is not possible. So, this suggests that one of these flags is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, one of these flags must be removed because the numbers indicate that only one can be a bomb. So, perhaps one of them is a false flag.\n\nNow, looking at row 9, column 9 is '_', which is revealed as empty. So, the '1' at (8,9)=F is a flag, but the adjacent square (9,9) is empty. So, the '1' at (8,8)=1 needs one bomb in its adjacent squares. If (8,9)=F is a bomb, then that's one. But then, the '1' at (7,8)=1 would have (7,9)=F as a bomb, which would make it two bombs, which is not allowed. So, perhaps one of these flags is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bomb is elsewhere. Let me check the numbers around (7,9)=F.\n\nThe '1' at (7,8) would have (7,9)=F as a bomb. But if (7,9)=F is a bomb, then the '1' at (7,8) is satisfied. But then the '1' at (8,8) would also have (8,9)=F as a bomb, making it two bombs, which contradicts the '1' at (8,8). So, this suggests that perhaps (8,9)=F is not a bomb, but a false flag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (7,9)=F is the correct bomb, and (8,9)=F is a false flag. Because if (7,9)=F is a bomb, then the '1' at (7,8) is satisfied, but the '1' at (8,8) would need another bomb elsewhere. But (8,8)=1 has adjacent squares (8,7), (8,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). So, if (7,9)=F is a bomb, then the '1' at (8,8) would have (7,9)=F as a bomb, satisfying the '1'. But then, the '1' at (7,8) would have (7,9)=F as a bomb, which is fine. But then, the '1' at (8,8) would have only one bomb, which is correct. However, the '1' at (8,9)=F would have (8,8)=1 and (7,9)=F as adjacent. Wait, no, (8,9)=F is a flag, so it's considered a bomb. So, the '1' at (8,8) is adjacent to (8,9)=F, which is a bomb, and (7,9)=F, which is also a bomb. So, that would make two bombs adjacent to (8,8)=1, which is incorrect. Therefore, this suggests that one of these flags is wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps (8,9)=F is not a bomb, and the bomb is elsewhere. Let me see.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 8=1. It needs one bomb adjacent. If (8,9)=F is not a bomb, then the bomb must be elsewhere, perhaps at (9,8)=1. Wait, (9,8)=1 is a number, so it's a revealed number, meaning it's safe. So, the '1' at (9,8)=1 needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nIts adjacent squares are (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9), (10,7), (10,8), (10,9). But row 10 doesn't exist, so only up to row 9. So, adjacent squares are (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9).\n\nSo, (8,9)=F is a flag, which would be a bomb. So, the '1' at (9,8)=1 needs one bomb. If (8,9)=F is a bomb, that satisfies it. But then, the '1' at (8,8)=1 would have (8,9)=F as a bomb, which is correct. But then, the '1' at (7,8)=1 would have (7,9)=F as a bomb, which would be correct. So, that would mean both (7,9) and (8,9) are bombs, but that would make the '1' at (8,8)=1 have two bombs adjacent, which is not allowed. Therefore, this is a conflict.\n\nThis suggests that one of these flags is incorrect. So, perhaps one of them should be removed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bomb is elsewhere. Let's see.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 9=F. Let's check the numbers around it.\n\nThe '1' at (7,8)=1 would have (7,9)=F as a bomb, which is correct. The '1' at (8,8)=1 would have (8,9)=F as a bomb, which would make two bombs adjacent to (8,8)=1, which is incorrect. So, this suggests that (8,9)=F is not a bomb, but a false flag.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bomb is at (7,9)=F, and (8,9)=F is not a bomb. So, the '1' at (8,8)=1 would need another bomb somewhere else.\n\nWait, but (8,8)=1 has adjacent squares (8,7), (8,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9).\n\nIf (7,9)=F is a bomb, then the '1' at (8,8)=1 would have that as one bomb, which is correct. But then, the '1' at (7,8)=1 would have (7,9)=F as a bomb, which is correct. But then, the '1' at (8,8)=1 would have only one bomb, which is correct. However, the '1' at (9,8)=1 would have (8,9)=F as a bomb, but if (8,9)=F is not a bomb, then the '1' at (9,8)=1 would need another bomb elsewhere.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another area where the numbers are more straightforward.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 5=1. Its adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). Let me see if any of these are flagged or revealed.\n\n(5,5)=1, (6,5)=1, (7,5)=1. So, maybe the bomb is at (6,6)=_, but it's revealed as empty. So, no, that can't be. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 2, column 4=2. It needs two bombs adjacent. We know that (3,4)=F is one bomb. So, where is the other? The adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So, (3,4)=F is one bomb. So, where is the other? Maybe (3,5)=_, but it's revealed as empty. So, that can't be. So, perhaps (2,5)=1, which is a number, so it's safe. So, maybe (1,4)=1 is adjacent to (2,4)=2. Wait, (1,4)=1 has adjacent squares, including (2,4)=2. So, maybe the bomb is at (1,4)=1's adjacent squares.\n\nWait, (1,4)=1 needs one bomb. Its adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). So, (2,4)=2 has one bomb at (3,4)=F, and needs another. So, perhaps the other bomb is at (1,5)=1. Wait, but (1,5)=1 is a number, so it's safe. So, that can't be.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for a spot where the numbers clearly indicate a safe spot or a definite bomb.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5=1. Its adjacent squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Let's see.\n\n(4,4)=2, (4,5)=2, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=2, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=2, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=_. So, perhaps the bomb is at (5,6)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, column 4=2. Its adjacent squares are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,4)=F is one bomb. So, it needs another bomb in its adjacent squares. So, perhaps (4,5)=2 is a number, so it's safe. So, the other bomb must be elsewhere. Maybe (3,3)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe. Hmm.\n\nWait, (3,3)=1. Its adjacent squares are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (3,4)=F is a bomb, so the '1' at (3,3)=1 is satisfied. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but (3,3)=1 has (3,4)=F as a bomb, so that's correct. So, the '2' at (4,4)=2 has (3,4)=F as one bomb, and needs another. So, perhaps the other bomb is at (4,5)=2. But (4,5)=2 is a number, so it's safe. So, perhaps the bomb is at (5,4)=2, which is a number, so it's safe. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a spot where the numbers clearly indicate a safe square.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 4=1. Its adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). Let's see:\n\n(0,5)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1. None of these are flagged except perhaps (3,4)=F, but that's not adjacent to (0,4). So, the bomb must be somewhere else. Wait, (0,4)=1's adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). None of these are flagged, so the bomb must be in one of these squares. But since none are flagged, perhaps I can reveal one of them to check.\n\nWait, but revealing a square could be risky. Alternatively, maybe I can place a flag somewhere else.\n\nWait, looking at row 9, column 9=_ is revealed as empty. So, that's safe. Let me check the numbers around it.\n\nRow 8, column 9=F is a flag. Row 9, column 8=1. So, the '1' at (9,8)=1 needs one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9), (10,7), (10,8), (10,9). But row 10 doesn't exist, so only up to row 9. So, the adjacent squares are (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9).\n\n(8,9)=F is a flag, so if that's a bomb, then the '1' at (9,8)=1 is satisfied. But then, the '1' at (8,8)=1 would have two bombs adjacent: (8,9)=F and (7,9)=F, which would be two bombs, which is incorrect. So, this suggests that (8,9)=F is not a bomb, and the bomb is elsewhere.\n\nWait, but (8,8)=1 needs one bomb. If (8,9)=F is not a bomb, then the bomb must be elsewhere. Maybe at (9,9)=_, which is revealed as empty, so that can't be. So, perhaps (7,9)=F is the bomb, and (8,9)=F is a false flag.\n\nSo, perhaps I should remove the flag from (8,9)=F, because it's conflicting with the numbers.\n\nWait, but if I remove the flag from (8,9), then the '1' at (8,8)=1 would need another bomb elsewhere. Let me see.\n\nIf (8,9)=F is not a bomb, then the '1' at (8,8)=1 must have another bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are (8,7), (8,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9).\n\nIf (7,9)=F is a bomb, then the '1' at (8,8)=1 would have (7,9)=F as a bomb, which is correct. But then, the '1' at (7,8)=1 would have (7,9)=F as a bomb, which is correct. So, perhaps (7,9)=F is the correct bomb, and (8,9)=F is a false flag that should be removed.\n\nSo, perhaps I should remove the flag from (8,9)=F.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reveal a square near (8,8)=1 to see if it's safe.\n\nWait, but revealing a square could be risky. Alternatively, maybe I can place a flag elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking at row 3, column 5=_ is a revealed empty. So, that's safe. Let me see the numbers around it.\n\nRow 3, column 5=_ is adjacent to (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (3,4)=F, (3,6)=_, (4,4)=2, (4,5)=2, (4,6)=1. So, the '2' at (3,4)=F is a bomb, so that's one. The '2' at (4,5)=2 needs two bombs adjacent. It's adjacent to (3,4)=F, which is one, so it needs another. So, perhaps the other bomb is at (4,6)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe. So, maybe the bomb is at (5,5)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should make a move based on the conflict in the bottom right corner.\n\nSo, perhaps the flag at (8,9)=F is incorrect and should be removed. So, I can make a move to remove the flag from (8,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag at (7,9)=F is correct, and the flag at (8,9)=F is incorrect. So, removing the flag at (8,9)=F.\n\nSo, my move would be to remove the flag from (8,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reveal a square near (8,8)=1 to see if it's safe.\n\nWait, but revealing (8,7)=1 would be risky. Alternatively, perhaps I can place a flag elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking at row 5, column 5=1. Its adjacent squares are (4,4)=2, (4,5)=2, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=2, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=2, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=_. So, the '1' at (5,5)=1 needs one bomb in these squares. Since (4,4)=2 has a bomb at (3,4)=F, so that's one. So, perhaps the other bomb is at (4,5)=2, but that's a number, so it's safe. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 2, column 5=1. Its adjacent squares are (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=_, (2,4)=2, (2,6)=_, (3,4)=F, (3,5)=_, (3,6)=_. So, the '1' at (2,5)=1 needs one bomb. Since (3,4)=F is a bomb, that's one, so that's correct. So, no issue there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the bottom right corner where the conflict is.\n\nSo, the '1' at (8,8)=1 has adjacent squares (8,9)=F and (7,9)=F. So, if both are bombs, that would make two bombs adjacent to (8,8)=1, which is incorrect. So, one of these must not be a bomb. So, perhaps (8,9)=F is not a bomb, and the bomb is elsewhere.\n\nSo, perhaps I should remove the flag from (8,9)=F.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bomb is at (9,8)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe.\n\nWait, no, (9,8)=1 is a number, so it's safe, but it needs one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9). (8,9)=F is a flag, so if that's a bomb, then (9,8)=1 is satisfied. But then, (8,8)=1 would have two bombs adjacent: (7,9)=F and (8,9)=F, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps (8,9)=F is not a bomb, and the bomb is elsewhere.\n\nWait, but where? Maybe the bomb is at (9,9)=_, which is revealed as empty, so that can't be. So, perhaps the bomb is at (7,9)=F, and (8,9)=F is not a bomb, but a false flag.\n\nSo, perhaps I should remove the flag from (8,9)=F.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reveal (8,7)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe.\n\nWait, (8,7)=1 is a number, so it's safe. So, the '1' at (8,7)=1 needs one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). So, perhaps the bomb is at (7,8)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe. Hmm.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should make a move based on the conflict in the bottom right corner.\n\nSo, I think the flag at (8,9)=F is incorrect and should be removed. So, my move would be to remove the flag from (8,9)=F.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the flag at (7,9)=F is correct, and the flag at (8,9)=F is incorrect. So, I should remove the flag from (8,9)=F.\n\nSo, my move would be to remove the flag from (8,9)=F.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reveal (8,7)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a spot where the numbers clearly indicate a safe square.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 6=1. Its adjacent squares are (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). Let me see.\n\n(3,5)=_, (3,6)=_, (3,7)=_, (4,5)=2, (4,7)=_, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=_. So, the '1' at (4,6)=1 needs one bomb in these squares. Since none are flagged, perhaps the bomb is at (5,5)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bomb is at (4,5)=2, but that's a number, so it's safe. Hmm.\n\nI think I'm stuck, but based on the conflict in the bottom right, I think the flag at (8,9)=F is incorrect and should be removed. So, my move would be to remove the flag from (8,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place a flag elsewhere where the numbers indicate a bomb.\n\nWait, looking at row 3, column 5=_ is revealed as empty, so that's safe. So, the '2' at (3,4)=F is a bomb, which is correct because it's a flag.\n\nWait, no, (3,4)=F is a flag, which is a bomb. So, the '2' at (3,4)=F is a bomb, so that's correct.\n\nWait, no, the '2' at (3,4)=F is a flag, which is a bomb. So, the '2' at (3,4)=F is a bomb, which is correct.\n\nWait, no, (3,4)=F is a flag, which is a bomb, so the '2' at (3,4)=F is correct because it's a bomb. So, that's fine.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should make a move based on the conflict in the bottom right.\n\nSo, I think the flag at (8,9)=F is incorrect and should be removed. So, my move would be to remove the flag from (8,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place a flag at (7,9)=F, but that's already flagged. So, maybe I can reveal a square near there.\n\nWait, (7,8)=1 is a number, so it's safe. So, the '1' at (7,8)=1 needs one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,7), (7,9), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). So, if (7,9)=F is a bomb, that's correct. But then, the '1' at (8,8)=1 would have two bombs adjacent: (7,9)=F and (8,9)=F, which is incorrect. So, perhaps (8,9)=F is not a bomb, and the bomb is elsewhere.\n\nWait, but where else? The '1' at (8,8)=1 needs one bomb. If (8,9)=F is not a bomb, then the bomb must be elsewhere. Maybe at (8,7)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bomb is at (9,8)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should just make a move based on the conflict.\n\nSo, I think the flag at (8,9)=F is incorrect, so I'll remove it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place a flag elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking at row 9, column 9=_ is revealed as empty, so that's safe. So, the '1' at (9,8)=1 needs one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9). So, if (8,9)=F is a bomb, then that's one, but that would cause the '1' at (8,8)=1 to have two bombs, which is incorrect. So, perhaps (8,9)=F is not a bomb, and the bomb is elsewhere.\n\nWait, but where? Maybe the bomb is at (9,7)=_, which is revealed as empty. So, that can't be. So, perhaps the bomb is at (8,7)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe.\n\nI think I'm going in circles. Maybe I should make a move based on the conflict.\n\nSo, I'll remove the flag from (8,9)=F, because it's causing a conflict with the '1' at (8,8)=1.\n\nSo, my move would be to remove the flag from (8,9)=F.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reveal (8,7)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe. So, revealing it wouldn't help.\n\nWait, but (8,7)=1 is a number, so it's safe. So, the '1' at (8,7)=1 needs one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares are (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). So, perhaps the bomb is at (9,8)=1, but that's a number, so it's safe. Hmm.\n\nI think I've spent enough time. I'll go with removing the flag from (8,9)=F.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis reveals a conflict in the bottom-right corner where two flags are causing a contradiction with the adjacent '1's. Removing the flag from (8,9) resolves this conflict.\n\nMOVE: 8,9,flag=false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n1 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n2 . . . . 2 _ 1 1 2 1\n3 . . . . 1 F _ _ _ _\n4 . . 2 2 2 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . . 2 2 . 1 _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 F\n8 . . . 1 1 1 1 . 1 F\n9 . . . . . . . . 1 _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board and trying to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, 3 flags are placed, so there are 7 flags remaining to place. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs without revealing any bombs.\n\nLooking at the board, I'll go row by row to see where I can make progress. I'll start from the top and move down.\n\nStarting with row 0 (x=0):\n- Columns 0-3 are unexplored (.), column 4 is 1, column 5 is _, column 6 is 1, columns 7-9 are . or 1.\n\nRow 0, column 4 has a 1. That means there's exactly one bomb in the surrounding 8 squares. Let me check the adjacent cells.\n\nThe 1 at (0,4) is surrounded by:\n- (0,3): .\n- (0,5): _ (empty)\n- (1,3): .\n- (1,4): 1\n- (1,5): _\n- (0,6): 1\nWait, actually, the adjacent cells are (x-1,y-1) to (x+1,y+1). So for (0,4), the adjacent cells are:\n- (0,3): .\n- (0,5): _\n- (1,3): .\n- (1,4): 1\n- (1,5): _\n- (-1,3): invalid\n- (-1,4): invalid\n- (-1,5): invalid\n\nSo, the possible bombs are in (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (1,4). But (1,4) is a 1, which already has its own bomb count. So the 1 at (0,4) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. Currently, I don't see any flags around it, so I might need to consider placing a flag somewhere here.\n\nMoving to row 1 (x=1):\n- Columns 0-3 are . , column 4 is 1, column 5 is _, column 6 is 1, columns 7-9 are . or 1.\n\nThe 1 at (1,4) is similar to (0,4). Its adjacent cells are:\n- (0,3): .\n- (0,4): 1\n- (0,5): _\n- (1,3): .\n- (1,5): _\n- (2,3): .\n- (2,4): 2\n- (2,5): _\n\nAgain, the 1 at (1,4) needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. Since (0,4) is a 1, which is satisfied by the bomb at (1,5) being a flag? Wait, no, (1,5) is _, which is empty. So maybe the bomb is elsewhere.\n\nLooking further down, row 2 (x=2):\n- Columns 0-3 are . , column 4 is 2, column 5 is _, column 6 is 1, columns 7-9 are 1, 2, 1.\n\nThe 2 at (2,4) indicates two bombs in the surrounding cells. Let's check around it.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- (1,3): .\n- (1,4): 1\n- (1,5): _\n- (2,3): .\n- (2,5): _\n- (3,3): .\n- (3,4): 1\n- (3,5): F\n\nWait, (3,5) is a flag, so that's one bomb accounted for. The 2 at (2,4) needs one more bomb in its adjacent cells. So the remaining possible bombs are in (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) is a 1, which is already satisfied by the flag at (3,5). So, perhaps (2,5) or (2,3) could be bombs.\n\nLooking at row 3 (x=3):\n- Columns 0-3 are . , column 4 is 1, column 5 is F, columns 6-9 are _, _, _, _.\n\nThe 1 at (3,4) is satisfied by the flag at (3,5). So no other bombs around it.\n\nRow 4 (x=4):\n- Columns 0-2 are . , column 3 is 2, column 4 is 2, column 5 is 2, column 6 is 1, columns 7-9 are _, _, _, _.\n\nThe 2 at (4,3) has adjacent cells:\n- (3,2): .\n- (3,3): .\n- (3,4): 1\n- (4,2): .\n- (4,4): 2\n- (5,2): .\n- (5,3): 2\n- (5,4): 2\n\nWait, this might be getting complicated. Let me look for areas where the numbers are already satisfied or where I can deduce a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 7 (x=7):\n- Columns 0-3 are . , column 4 is 1, columns 5-6 are _, _, column 7 is 1, column 8 is 1, column 9 is F.\n\nThe 1 at (7,4) needs one bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n- (6,3): .\n- (6,4): 2\n- (6,5): 1\n- (7,3): .\n- (7,5): _\n- (8,3): .\n- (8,4): 1\n- (8,5): 1\n\nHmm, not sure yet. Let's check row 8 (x=8):\n- Columns 0-3 are . , column 4 is 1, columns 5-6 are 1, _, columns 7-9 are 1, F.\n\nThe 1 at (8,4) is satisfied by the flag at (8,9)? Wait, no, the adjacent cells are:\n- (7,3): .\n- (7,4): 1\n- (7,5): _\n- (8,3): .\n- (8,5): 1\n- (9,3): .\n- (9,4): .\n- (9,5): .\n\nWait, the 1 at (8,4) needs one bomb in its adjacent cells. The flag at (8,9) is far away, so it's not adjacent. So the bomb must be somewhere else. Maybe (8,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back, the 1 at (8,4) has adjacent cells:\n- (7,3): .\n- (7,4): 1\n- (7,5): _\n- (8,3): .\n- (8,5): 1\n- (9,3): .\n- (9,4): .\n- (9,5): .\n\nNone of these are flags except maybe (7,4) is a 1, which is a number, not a bomb. So perhaps the bomb is at (8,5), but that's a 1. Wait, no, (8,5) is a 1, so it's a number, not a bomb. So where is the bomb for (8,4)'s 1? Maybe (8,5) is a bomb, but it's showing 1, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. So perhaps the bomb is at (7,5), which is _, so it's empty. Wait, but (7,5) is _, which is empty, so it's safe. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me look for areas where the numbers are already satisfied or where I can deduce a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 9 is F, which is a flag. So that's one bomb accounted for. Similarly, row 8, column 9 is F, another bomb. And row 3, column 5 is F, another bomb. So that's three flags placed so far. There are 7 flags remaining, so 10 - 3 = 7 bombs left to flag.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 5 is _, which is empty. So that's safe. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for cells that are surrounded by numbers that indicate they must be bombs or must be safe.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 6 is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n- (1,5): _\n- (1,6): 1\n- (1,7): .\n- (2,5): _\n- (2,7): 1\n- (3,5): F\n- (3,6): _\n- (3,7): _\n\nThe 1 at (2,6) needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. The flag at (3,5) is one, so the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,6), (3,7) are all safe except (3,5). So I can reveal those cells as safe.\n\nWait, but (1,6) is 1, which is a number. So it's already a number, so it's safe. So perhaps I can reveal (2,5) as it's adjacent to the 1 at (2,6) and already has one flag at (3,5). So (2,5) is safe.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe 1 at (2,6) has one flag at (3,5), so the other adjacent cells must be safe. So I can safely reveal (2,5), (1,5), (1,7), (2,7), (3,6), (3,7).\n\nBut let me check (2,5). If I reveal (2,5), it's adjacent to (2,6)'s 1, which is already satisfied by (3,5). So (2,5) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for cells that are surrounded by numbers that indicate they must be bombs.\n\nLooking at row 5 (x=5):\n- Columns 0-2 are . , column 3 is 2, column 4 is ., column 5 is 1, columns 6-9 are _, _, _, _.\n\nThe 2 at (5,3) indicates two bombs in its adjacent cells. Let's see the adjacent cells:\n- (4,2): .\n- (4,3): 2\n- (4,4): 2\n- (5,2): .\n- (5,4): .\n- (6,2): .\n- (6,3): .\n- (6,4): 2\n\nWait, (5,3) is 2, so two bombs around it. Let's see, adjacent cells include (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nBut (4,3) is 2, which is a number, so it's safe. (4,4) is 2, also a number. So the bombs must be in (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). But (6,4) is 2, which is a number, so it's safe. So the bombs must be in (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3).\n\nBut this is getting a bit complex. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 6 (x=6):\n- Columns 0-3 are . , column 4 is 2, column 5 is 1, columns 6-9 are _, _, _, _.\n\nThe 2 at (6,4) has adjacent cells:\n- (5,3): 2\n- (5,4): .\n- (5,5): 1\n- (6,3): .\n- (6,5): 1\n- (7,3): .\n- (7,4): 1\n- (7,5): _\n\nThe 2 at (6,4) needs two bombs. The adjacent cells include (5,5) which is 1, so that's a number, not a bomb. (7,4) is 1, also a number. So the bombs must be elsewhere. Maybe (5,3) is 2, which is a number, so not a bomb. Hmm, perhaps (5,4) or (6,3) could be bombs.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check another area.\n\nLooking at row 9 (x=9):\n- Columns 0-8 are . , column 9 is 1.\n\nThe 1 at (9,9) indicates one bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (8,8): ., (8,9): F, (9,8): ., (9,9): 1.\n\nWait, (8,9) is F, so that's one bomb. So the 1 at (9,9) is satisfied by the flag at (8,9). So the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (9,8) is ., which is unexplored, but since the 1 is satisfied, (9,8) is safe. So I can reveal (9,8) as safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere else.\n\nWait, let me go back to row 3, column 5 (x=3, y=5) which is F. That's a flag, so that's a bomb. Now, looking at row 3, column 4 (x=3, y=4) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (3,5) which is F, so that's one bomb. So the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (3,3) is ., which is unexplored, but since the 1 at (3,4) is satisfied by (3,5), (3,3) is safe. So I can reveal (3,3) as safe.\n\nWait, but (3,3) is ., so revealing it would show if it's a number or safe. If I reveal it and it's a number, that could help. But since the 1 at (3,4) is satisfied by the flag at (3,5), (3,3) must be safe. So I can safely reveal (3,3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for cells that are surrounded by numbers that indicate they must be bombs.\n\nWait, let me check row 4, column 3 (x=4, y=3) is 2. Its adjacent cells include (3,2): ., (3,3): ., (3,4): 1, (4,2): ., (4,4): 2, (5,2): ., (5,3): 2, (5,4): .\n\nThe 2 at (4,3) needs two bombs in its adjacent cells. Let's see, adjacent cells include (3,4): 1, which is a number, so not a bomb. (5,3) is 2, which is a number. So the bombs must be in (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4). But (4,4) is 2, which is a number, so not a bomb. (5,3) is 2, which is a number. So the bombs must be in (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,4).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for other areas.\n\nWait, looking at row 7, column 9 is F. That's a bomb. The 1 at (7,7) is adjacent to (7,8): 1, (7,9): F. So the 1 at (7,7) needs one bomb, which is satisfied by (7,9). So the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (6,6): _, (6,7): _, (6,8): _, (7,6): _, (7,8): _, (8,6): _, (8,7): 1, (8,8): 1.\n\nWait, the 1 at (7,7) is satisfied by (7,9), so the other cells around it must be safe. So (7,6) is _, which is empty, so it's safe. So I can reveal (7,6) as safe.\n\nWait, but (7,6) is _, so revealing it would show if it's a number or safe. Since the 1 at (7,7) is satisfied, (7,6) is safe. So I can reveal (7,6) as safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for cells that are definitely bombs.\n\nWait, looking at row 2, column 6 is 1. Its adjacent cells include (3,5): F, so that's one bomb. So the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (2,5) is _, which is empty, so it's safe. So I can reveal (2,5) as safe.\n\nWait, but (2,5) is _, so revealing it would show it's safe. Alternatively, maybe I can place a flag somewhere.\n\nWait, looking at row 4, column 5 is 1. Its adjacent cells include (3,4): 1, which is a number, (3,5): F, which is a bomb, (4,4): 2, which is a number, (4,6): _, (5,4): ., (5,5): 1, (5,6): _, (4,5) is 1.\n\nWait, the 1 at (4,5) needs one bomb in its adjacent cells. The flag at (3,5) is one bomb, so the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (4,4) is 2, which is a number, so it's safe. (4,6) is _, which is empty, so it's safe. So I can reveal (4,6) as safe.\n\nWait, but (4,6) is _, so revealing it would show it's safe. Alternatively, maybe I should look for a cell that must be a bomb.\n\nWait, looking at row 5, column 5 is 1. Its adjacent cells include (4,4): 2, (4,5): 1, (4,6): _, (5,4): ., (5,6): _, (6,4): 2, (6,5): 1, (6,6): _.\n\nThe 1 at (5,5) needs one bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (4,5): 1, which is a number, so not a bomb. (6,5): 1, which is a number. So the bomb must be in (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6). But (6,4) is 2, which is a number. So the bomb must be in (5,4) or (5,6) or (6,6).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for cells that are definitely safe.\n\nWait, looking at row 2, column 6 is 1. It's adjacent to (3,5): F, which is a bomb. So the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (2,5) is _, which is empty, so it's safe. So I can reveal (2,5) as safe.\n\nWait, but (2,5) is _, so revealing it would show it's safe. Alternatively, maybe I should look for cells that are definitely bombs.\n\nWait, looking at row 7, column 9 is F, which is a bomb. The 1 at (7,7) is satisfied by (7,9). So the other adjacent cells are safe. So (7,6) is _, which is empty, so it's safe. So I can reveal (7,6) as safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for cells that are definitely bombs.\n\nWait, looking at row 8, column 9 is F, which is a bomb. The 1 at (8,4) is adjacent to (8,5): 1, which is a number, and (8,9): F. So the 1 at (8,4) is satisfied by (8,9). So the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (8,3) is ., which is unexplored, but since the 1 is satisfied, (8,3) is safe. So I can reveal (8,3) as safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for cells that are definitely bombs.\n\nWait, looking at row 7, column 9 is F, which is a bomb. The 1 at (7,7) is satisfied by (7,9). So the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (7,6) is _, which is empty, so it's safe. So I can reveal (7,6) as safe.\n\nWait, but I think I'm going in circles. Maybe I should look for a cell that is definitely a bomb.\n\nWait, looking at row 3, column 5 is F, which is a bomb. The 1 at (3,4) is satisfied by (3,5). So the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (3,3) is ., which is unexplored, but since the 1 is satisfied, (3,3) is safe. So I can reveal (3,3) as safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place a flag somewhere.\n\nWait, looking at row 5, column 5 is 1. It needs one bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (4,5): 1, which is a number, so not a bomb. (6,5): 1, which is a number. So the bomb must be in (5,4) or (5,6). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for cells that are surrounded by numbers that indicate they must be bombs.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 3 is 2. It needs two bombs in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (3,2): ., (3,3): ., (3,4): 1, (4,2): ., (4,4): 2, (5,2): ., (5,3): 2, (5,4): ., (5,5): 1.\n\nWait, the 2 at (4,3) needs two bombs. The adjacent cells include (3,4): 1, which is a number, so not a bomb. (5,3): 2, which is a number. So the bombs must be in (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,4).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for cells that are definitely bombs.\n\nWait, looking at row 7, column 9 is F, which is a bomb. The 1 at (7,7) is satisfied by (7,9). So the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (7,6) is _, which is empty, so it's safe. So I can reveal (7,6) as safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place a flag at (5,6) because of the 1 at (5,5). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for cells that are definitely bombs.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 6 is 1. It's adjacent to (3,5): F, which is a bomb. So the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (2,5) is _, which is empty, so it's safe. So I can reveal (2,5) as safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place a flag at (5,6) because of the 1 at (5,5). Let me check:\n\nThe 1 at (5,5) has adjacent cells:\n- (4,4): 2\n- (4,5): 1\n- (4,6): _\n- (5,4): .\n- (5,6): _\n- (6,4): 2\n- (6,5): 1\n- (6,6): _\n\nThe 1 at (5,5) needs one bomb. The flag at (3,5) is not adjacent to (5,5), so it doesn't count. The adjacent cells include (4,5): 1, which is a number, so not a bomb. So the bomb must be in (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for cells that are definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 6 is 1. It's adjacent to (3,5): F, so that's one bomb. So the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (2,5) is _, which is empty, so it's safe. So I can reveal (2,5) as safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place a flag at (5,6) because of the 1 at (5,5). Let me check:\n\nThe 1 at (5,5) needs one bomb. The adjacent cells are (4,5): 1, which is a number, (6,5): 1, which is a number, so the bomb must be in (5,6) or (5,4). But (5,4) is ., which is unexplored. So maybe (5,6) is a bomb. So I can place a flag at (5,6).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check:\n\nThe 1 at (5,5) needs one bomb. The adjacent cells are (4,5): 1, (5,4): ., (5,6): _, (6,5): 1, (6,6): _, (4,6): _, (6,4): 2, which is a number.\n\nSo the bomb must be in (5,4) or (5,6). But I don't have enough information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reveal (2,5) as safe because the 1 at (2,6) is satisfied by (3,5). So (2,5) is safe.\n\nSo I think I can safely reveal (2,5) as safe. Let me check:\n\nRevealing (2,5) would show if it's a number or safe. But since the 1 at (2,6) is satisfied by (3,5), (2,5) is safe.\n\nSo I'll choose to reveal (2,5) as safe.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (2,5) is adjacent to the 1 at (2,6), which is satisfied by the flag at (3,5).

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me look at the board and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the board row by row to see where the numbers are and where the flags are. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Right now, there are 7 flags remaining, which means 3 flags have already been placed.\n\nLooking at row 0, I see some numbers. At (0,4) there's a 1, and at (0,6) there's another 1. Then, at (0,8) and (0,9), it's dots, so those are unexplored. Hmm, but I don't see any flags near these numbers yet.\n\nMoving to row 1, similar to row 0, there are 1s at (1,4) and (1,6). Again, no flags around them. So maybe I should check if these 1s can help me place flags or reveal safe squares.\n\nRow 2 has some higher numbers. At (2,4) there's a 2, (2,5) is a 1, (2,7) is another 1, and (2,8) is a 2, and (2,9) is a 1. So this row is a bit more complex. I notice that at (2,5) there's a 1, but no flags around it yet.\n\nRow 3 has a 1 at (3,4) and a flag at (3,5). So, the 1 at (3,4) is next to a flag. That means, according to the rules, there can't be another bomb adjacent to (3,4). So the other squares around (3,4) must be safe or already revealed. Let me check the adjacent squares.\n\nLooking around (3,4), the flag is at (3,5), so that's one bomb accounted for. The other adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Wait, (3,4) is the 1, so it has exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. Since (3,5) is a flag, that's the one bomb. So the other squares around (3,4) shouldn't have any bombs. So maybe I can reveal some of them.\n\nLooking at (3,3), which is a dot, so unexplored. If I reveal that, it might be safe. Alternatively, maybe I can look for other clues.\n\nRow 4 has a 2 at (4,2), another 2 at (4,3), another 2 at (4,4), and a 1 at (4,5). So that's a cluster of numbers. Let me see if I can deduce anything from that.\n\nSince (4,2) is a 2, it needs two bombs around it. The adjacent squares are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). But I don't see any flags there yet. Hmm, maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nRow 5 has a 2 at (5,2), another 2 at (5,3), and a 1 at (5,5). Again, similar to row 4. Let's see if I can find any flags around these numbers.\n\nRow 6 has a 2 at (6,3), a 1 at (6,4), and a 1 at (6,5). So, that's another cluster. At (6,3), the 2 means two bombs are adjacent. The adjacent squares are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). I don't see any flags there, so maybe I can't do much yet.\n\nRow 7 has a 1 at (7,3), and then a F at (7,9). So, the 1 at (7,3) needs one bomb in its adjacent squares. The adjacent squares are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). There's a flag at (7,9), but that's far from (7,3), so it doesn't affect it. So maybe I can look for other flags around (7,3).\n\nRow 8 has a 1 at (8,3), a 1 at (8,4), and a 1 at (8,5), and a F at (8,9). So, the 1s here each need one bomb nearby. The flags are at (8,9), but again, that's far from these 1s. So maybe the bombs are elsewhere.\n\nRow 9 has a 1 at (9,8) and a _ at (9,9). So, (9,8) is a 1, meaning one bomb is adjacent. The adjacent squares are (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). Since (8,9) is a flag, that's one bomb. So the 1 at (9,8) is satisfied because (8,9) is a flag. So that means the other adjacent squares to (9,8) can't have any bombs. So, (9,7) and (8,7) should be safe. But I don't know if they're already revealed or not.\n\nWait, looking back at the board, (9,7) is a dot, so unexplored. So maybe I can reveal that.\n\nBut before that, let me check other rows for more clues.\n\nLooking back at row 3, (3,4) is a 1 with a flag at (3,5). So, that 1 is satisfied. So, the other adjacent squares to (3,4) should be safe. The adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Since (3,5) is a flag, the other squares around (3,4) should be safe. So, (3,3) is a dot, which is unexplored. Maybe I can reveal that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, (7,9) is a flag, which is a bomb. So, the adjacent squares to (7,9) are (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9). Since (7,9) is a bomb, the numbers around it should reflect that. For example, (6,9) is a dot, (7,8) is a 1, (8,8) is a 1, and (6,8) is a 1. So, (7,8) is a 1, meaning it has one bomb adjacent, which is (7,9). So, the other adjacent squares to (7,8) should be safe. So, (6,7), (6,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8). But (8,8) is a 1, which already has one bomb at (7,9), so the other adjacent squares to (8,8) should be safe. So, (7,7), (7,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8). Since (7,8) is a 1, and (8,8) is a 1, both have their bombs accounted for, so their other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nSo, maybe I can reveal (9,7), which is adjacent to (8,8) and (9,8). Since (9,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (8,9), then (9,7) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, (3,4) is a 1 with a flag at (3,5). So, the other adjacent squares to (3,4) should be safe. So, (3,3) is a dot, so I can reveal that.\n\nWait, but let me check if revealing (3,3) is safe. If I reveal it, it might be a number, which could give me more information. Alternatively, maybe I can place a flag somewhere else.\n\nLooking at row 2, (2,4) is a 2, which needs two bombs around it. The adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). We know that (3,5) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So, (2,4) needs another bomb. Where could that be? It could be at (1,5), which is a 1, but (1,5) is a 1, which already has a flag at (1,5)? Wait, no, (1,5) is a 1, which is a number, not a flag. Wait, (3,5) is a flag, so (2,4) is a 2, which is adjacent to (3,5) as one bomb. So, where's the other bomb? It could be at (1,5) or (2,5). But (2,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, (1,5) must be a bomb. Wait, but (1,5) is a 1, which is a number, not a bomb. So that's a problem. Because (2,4) is a 2, which needs two bombs. One is at (3,5), so the other must be somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine row 2, column 4. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,3): dot\n- (1,4): 1\n- (1,5): 1\n- (2,3): dot\n- (2,5): 1\n- (3,3): dot\n- (3,4): 1\n- (3,5): F\n\nSo, the bombs adjacent to (2,4) are (3,5) as a flag, and maybe another one. But (1,5) is a 1, which means it has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares to (1,5) are (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). Wait, (1,5) is a 1, so it needs one bomb. The adjacent squares include (2,4), which is a 2, but that's a number, not a bomb. So, the bomb for (1,5) must be somewhere else, maybe (0,5) or (1,4). But (0,4) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. (1,4) is a 1, so it can't be a bomb either. So, this is confusing. Maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet me check row 7, (7,9) is a flag. The adjacent squares are (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9). So, (7,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, the other adjacent squares to (7,8) are safe. So, (6,7), (6,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8). So, (8,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, the other adjacent squares to (8,8) are safe, which are (7,7), (7,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8). So, (9,7) is a dot, so maybe I can reveal that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, (4,5) is a 1. The adjacent squares are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). (3,5) is a flag, so that's one bomb. So, the other adjacent squares to (4,5) can't have any bombs. So, (4,4) is a 2, (4,6) is a _, (5,4) is a 2, (5,5) is a 1, (5,6) is a _. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, (4,5) is a 1, so only one bomb adjacent, which is (3,5). So, the other squares around (4,5) should be safe. So, (4,4) is a 2, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (4,6) is a _, so maybe I can reveal that.\n\nWait, but (4,6) is adjacent to (4,5), which is a 1, so (4,6) can't be a bomb because (4,5) is already satisfied by (3,5). So, (4,6) is safe. So, maybe I can reveal (4,6).\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9, (9,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (8,9) being a flag. So, the other adjacent squares to (9,8) are (8,7), (9,7), and (9,9). So, (9,7) is a dot, so I can reveal that.\n\nWait, but (9,7) is adjacent to (8,8), which is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, (9,7) should be safe. So, maybe I can reveal (9,7).\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, (3,4) is a 1 with a flag at (3,5). So, the other adjacent squares to (3,4) are safe. So, (3,3) is a dot, so I can reveal that.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the best move. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at row 7, (7,9) is a flag. The adjacent squares to (7,9) are (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9). (7,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, the other adjacent squares to (7,8) are safe. So, (6,7), (6,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8). So, (8,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, the other adjacent squares to (8,8) are safe, which includes (9,7) and (9,8). So, (9,7) is a dot, so I can reveal that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8, (8,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, the other adjacent squares to (8,8) are safe, including (9,7). So, revealing (9,7) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 2, (2,4) is a 2, which needs two bombs. We know (3,5) is a flag, so that's one. So, where's the other? It could be at (1,5), which is a 1. But (1,5) is a 1, which needs one bomb. So, if (1,5) is a 1, and it's adjacent to (2,4), which is a 2, maybe (1,5) is a bomb? But (1,5) is a 1, so it's a number, not a bomb. So, that can't be. So, maybe the other bomb for (2,4) is at (2,5), but (2,5) is a 1, so that can't be. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for squares that are definitely safe. For example, in row 9, (9,7) is adjacent to (8,8), which is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, (9,7) should be safe. So, I can reveal (9,7).\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, (3,4) is a 1 with a flag at (3,5). So, the other adjacent squares to (3,4) are safe. So, (3,3) is a dot, so I can reveal that.\n\nWait, but (3,3) is adjacent to (3,4), which is a 1, so revealing (3,3) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, (6,3) is a 2, which needs two bombs. The adjacent squares are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (7,3) is a 1, which is a number, so not a bomb. So, maybe the bombs are at (5,3) or (5,4). But (5,3) is a 2, which is a number, so not a bomb. So, maybe (5,4) is a bomb? But (5,4) is a dot, so it's unexplored. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for squares that are definitely safe. Let's go back to row 9, (9,7) is adjacent to (8,8), which is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, (9,7) should be safe. So, I can reveal (9,7).\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 0, (0,4) is a 1, which needs one bomb. The adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). (1,5) is a 1, which is a number, so not a bomb. So, the bomb must be at (1,4) or (0,5). But (1,4) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, (0,5) must be a bomb? But (0,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Wait, that's a problem. Because (0,4) is a 1, which needs one bomb. The adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). All of these are either dots or numbers, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe (0,5) is a bomb? But (0,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, (7,9) is a flag. The adjacent squares are (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9). (7,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, the other adjacent squares to (7,8) are safe, which includes (6,7), (6,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8). So, (6,7) is a dot, so I can reveal that.\n\nWait, but (6,7) is adjacent to (5,6), which is a 1. So, (5,6) is a 1, which needs one bomb. The adjacent squares to (5,6) are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). So, if I reveal (6,7), which is a dot, and it's adjacent to (5,6), which is a 1. If (6,7) is safe, then (5,6)'s bomb must be somewhere else.\n\nWait, but (5,6) is a 1, so it needs one bomb. The adjacent squares are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (6,7) is a dot, so if I reveal it, if it's safe, then the bomb must be elsewhere. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for squares that are definitely bombs. For example, in row 2, (2,4) is a 2, which needs two bombs. One is at (3,5), which is a flag. So, the other bomb must be somewhere else. Let's see, the adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). We know (3,5) is a bomb. So, the other bomb must be at (1,5) or (2,5). But (1,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. (2,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Hmm, that's a problem. That means (2,4) is a 2, which needs two bombs, but I can't find where they are. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, (2,4) is a 2, so it needs two bombs. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,3): dot\n- (1,4): 1\n- (1,5): 1\n- (2,3): dot\n- (2,5): 1\n- (3,3): dot\n- (3,4): 1\n- (3,5): F\n\nSo, (3,5) is a bomb, that's one. The other bomb must be somewhere else. Maybe (1,5) is a bomb? But (1,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, maybe (2,5) is a bomb? But (2,5) is a 1, so it can't be a bomb. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe (1,4) is a bomb? Because (1,4) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, I'm stuck here.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Let's look for squares that are definitely bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 7, (7,9) is a flag, which is a bomb. So, the adjacent squares to (7,9) are (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9). So, (7,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, the other adjacent squares to (7,8) are safe, which are (6,7), (6,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8). So, (6,7) is a dot, so I can reveal that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8, (8,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, the other adjacent squares to (8,8) are safe, which includes (9,7) and (9,8). So, (9,7) is a dot, so I can reveal that.\n\nWait, but (9,7) is adjacent to (8,8), which is a 1, so revealing (9,7) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, (3,4) is a 1, which is satisfied by (3,5). So, the other adjacent squares to (3,4) are safe. So, (3,3) is a dot, so I can reveal that.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the best move. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, (4,5) is a 1, which is satisfied by (3,5). So, the other adjacent squares to (4,5) are safe. So, (4,4) is a 2, which is a number, so it's safe. (4,6) is a _, so maybe I can reveal that.\n\nWait, (4,6) is adjacent to (4,5), which is a 1, so (4,6) can't be a bomb because (4,5) is already satisfied by (3,5). So, (4,6) is safe. So, I can reveal (4,6).\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, (6,5) is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,5), which is a _, but wait, (7,5) is a _, which is unexplored. So, maybe (7,5) is a bomb. But (6,5) is a 1, so it needs one bomb. So, the adjacent squares are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). So, (7,5) could be a bomb. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but (7,5) is adjacent to (7,4), which is a 1. So, (7,4) is a 1, which needs one bomb. The adjacent squares are (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). So, if (7,5) is a bomb, that would satisfy (7,4)'s 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place a flag somewhere. Let me see.\n\nLooking at row 2, (2,4) is a 2, which needs two bombs. One is at (3,5). So, the other bomb must be somewhere else. Let me check the adjacent squares again. (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So, (3,5) is a bomb. So, the other bomb must be at (1,5) or (2,5). But (1,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. (2,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, this is a problem. It means that (2,4) is a 2, which needs two bombs, but I can't find where the second bomb is. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe (1,5) is a bomb? But (1,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place a flag at (1,5). But (1,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me go back.\n\nAt (2,4), which is a 2, needs two bombs. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,3): dot\n- (1,4): 1\n- (1,5): 1\n- (2,3): dot\n- (2,5): 1\n- (3,3): dot\n- (3,4): 1\n- (3,5): F\n\nSo, (3,5) is a bomb. So, one bomb is accounted for. The other bomb must be somewhere else. But none of the other adjacent squares are flags or numbers indicating bombs. So, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (1,5) is a bomb. But (1,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe (2,5) is a bomb? But (2,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for other areas.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,4) is a 1, which needs one bomb. The adjacent squares are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). (1,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, the bomb must be at (1,4) or (0,5). But (1,4) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. (0,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, that's a problem. That means (0,4) is a 1, but I can't find where the bomb is. So, maybe I need to place a flag somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe (0,5) is a bomb. But (0,5) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, that can't be.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a square that's definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 9, (9,7) is adjacent to (8,8), which is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, (9,7) should be safe. So, I can reveal (9,7).\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, (3,3) is a dot, and it's adjacent to (3,4), which is a 1, which is satisfied by (3,5). So, (3,3) should be safe.\n\nWait, but (3,3) is also adjacent to (4,3), which is a 2. So, (4,3) is a 2, which needs two bombs. The adjacent squares are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). So, (3,4) is a 1, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. (4,4) is a 2, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb. So, the bombs for (4,3) must be elsewhere.\n\nWait, (4,3) is a 2, so it needs two bombs. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (3,2): dot\n- (3,3): dot\n- (3,4): 1\n- (4,2): 2\n- (4,4): 2\n- (5,2): 2\n- (5,3): 2\n- (5,4): 1\n\nSo, the bombs must be somewhere else. Maybe (5,3) is a bomb? But (5,3) is a 2, which is a number, so it can't be a bomb.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should make a move based on the earlier analysis.\n\nI think the safest move is to reveal (9,7), since it's adjacent to (8,8), which is a 1, and (8,8) is satisfied by (7,9). So, (9,7) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (3,3) is also safe because it's adjacent to (3,4), which is a 1, satisfied by (3,5). So, (3,3) should be safe.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing (9,7) because it's in a corner and might lead to more reveals.\n\nWait, but before I do that, let me check the adjacent squares. (9,7) is adjacent to (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9,6), (9,8). (8,8) is a 1, which is satisfied by (7,9). So, (9,7) should be safe.\n\nSo, I'll go with revealing (9,7).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The square at (9,7) is adjacent to (8,8), which is a 1, and (7,9), which is a flagged bomb. Since (8,8)'s adjacent bomb is accounted for by (7,9), (9,7) is safe to reveal.\n\nMOVE: 9,7,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n1 . . . . 1 _ 1 . . .\n2 . . . . 2 _ 1 1 2 1\n3 . . . . 1 F _ _ _ _\n4 . . 2 2 2 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . . 2 2 . 1 _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 F\n8 . . . 1 1 1 1 . 1 F\n9 . . . . . . . . 1 _", "sucess": true}
