{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board state. Right now, the entire board is unexplored except for some revealed spaces, but from the given state, it's all dots, meaning nothing has been revealed yet. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs to find. I have 10 flags remaining, which makes sense because there are 10 bombs.\n\nSince the board is completely unexplored, I don't have any numbers or flags placed yet. My options are to either start by revealing a tile or placing a flag. But since I don't have any information, placing a flag might not be the best move because I don't know where the bombs are. Plus, if I place a flag and it's wrong, I could be wasting a flag or even losing the game if I reveal a bomb later.\n\nI think the safest move is to reveal a tile. Revealing a tile can give me information about the surrounding area. If I reveal a number, it will tell me how many bombs are adjacent, which can help me deduce where the bombs might be. If I reveal an empty space (which is represented by an underscore in the legend, but in the board state, it's all dots), that's also useful because it means I can explore around that area without hitting a bomb.\n\nLooking at the board, all the positions are unexplored, so any tile I choose has the same risk. However, sometimes people start from the middle or edges because edges have fewer adjacent tiles, which might make the numbers easier to interpret. But since the board is 10x10, maybe starting near the top-left corner is as good as any other spot.\n\nI'll choose position (0,0) to reveal. This is the top-left corner. If it's a bomb, the game ends, but since there are 10 bombs, the chance is 10 out of 100, which is 10%. It's a bit risky, but without any information, it's a necessary risk. If it's a number, I can start planning my next moves based on that number.\n\nAlternatively, I could choose a position in the middle, like (5,5), but since I don't have any information, it doesn't matter much. The top-left corner is a common starting point, so I'll go with that.\n\nSo, my next move is to reveal the tile at (0,0). I'm setting flag to false because I'm revealing it, not placing a flag.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Since the board is completely unexplored, revealing a tile is the best move to gain information.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 0, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current board state and the game info provided.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining. That means I can flag all the bombs if I can find them correctly. The board has some revealed numbers and some empty spaces, so I need to use the numbers to deduce where the bombs might be.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that row 0 has a '1' at (0,3). That means there's exactly one bomb adjacent to that square. The adjacent squares would be (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4). But I don't know yet where that bomb is.\n\nIn row 1, there are '1's at (1,1) and (1,2), and a '2' at (1,3). The '2' at (1,3) indicates two bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent squares would be (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4). But since (1,3) is a '2', and (0,3) is a '1', maybe the bomb near (0,3) is affecting both.\n\nIn row 2, there's a '1' at (2,1). So that square has one bomb adjacent. Its neighbors are (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), and (3,2). But (1,1) is a '1', so maybe the bomb is somewhere around there.\n\nRow 3 has a '1' at (3,1), similar to row 2. Row 4 has '1's at (4,0) and (4,1). So (4,0) has one bomb nearby, and (4,1) also has one.\n\nNow, let's look for potential conflicts or obvious placements. Starting with the '1's. For example, the '1' at (0,3) must have exactly one bomb around it. If I can figure out where that bomb is, it might help.\n\nLooking at (0,3)'s neighbors: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4). But (1,3) is a '2', which means it has two bombs around it. So perhaps the bomb for (0,3) is at (1,3)'s position, but that can't be because (1,3) is a number, not a bomb. Wait, no, (1,3) is a '2', so it's a number, meaning it's safe, and the bombs are around it.\n\nWait, maybe the bomb near (0,3) is at (1,4), but I don't know yet.\n\nLooking at row 1, (1,1) is a '1', so it has one bomb around it. Its neighbors are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Since (1,2) is a '1', maybe the bomb is near there.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for squares where the numbers and flags could conflict. For example, if a '1' has two flags around it, that's a conflict because it can only have one bomb.\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any flags placed yet, so I don't have to worry about that yet. But when I place flags, I need to make sure they don't conflict with the numbers.\n\nAnother approach is to look for squares that are surrounded by numbers, which might indicate where the bombs are. For example, if a square is adjacent to two '1's, it might be a bomb because each '1' needs one bomb, and if they both point to the same square, that could be the bomb.\n\nLooking at (1,2), which is a '1', its neighbors include (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). Since (1,1) is a '1', maybe the bomb is at (2,2) because that would satisfy both (1,1) and (1,2). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (1,4) is a bomb because (0,3) is a '1' and (1,3) is a '2'. If (1,4) is a bomb, then (1,3) would have one bomb accounted for, needing another one elsewhere.\n\nWait, let's think step by step. The '2' at (1,3) needs two bombs around it. So the bombs could be in any of its eight neighbors. But (0,3) is a '1', so it already has one bomb. If (1,3) is a '2', then the other bomb must be somewhere else around it.\n\nLooking at (1,3)'s neighbors: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Since (0,3) is a '1', maybe the bomb near (0,3) is at (0,4), which would satisfy (0,3)'s '1' and also count towards (1,3)'s '2'. Then, the second bomb for (1,3) could be at (1,4) or (2,4), etc.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should look for other clues.\n\nLooking at row 4, (4,0) is a '1' and (4,1) is a '1'. So each of these has one bomb adjacent. Their neighbors are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1) for (4,0). And for (4,1), the neighbors include (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). So maybe the bombs are in (3,0) or (5,0) for (4,0)'s '1'. Similarly, for (4,1), maybe the bomb is at (3,2) or (5,2).\n\nBut without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total number of bombs and flags. Since there are 10 bombs and 10 flags, I can flag all of them, but I need to make sure I don't place flags where the numbers don't allow it.\n\nAnother approach is to look for squares that are most likely to be bombs based on the numbers around them. For example, if a square is adjacent to multiple numbers, it's more likely to be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to reveal a square that's likely to be safe based on the numbers. For example, if a square is next to a '1' and all other possible bomb locations are accounted for, it might be safe.\n\nWait, looking back at (0,3) as a '1', if I can figure out where its bomb is, that might help. Let's consider the possible squares around it. If I assume the bomb is at (1,4), then (0,3)'s '1' is satisfied, and (1,3)'s '2' would have one bomb at (1,4), needing another. Maybe the other bomb for (1,3) is at (2,4), but I don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, if the bomb is at (1,2), then (0,3)'s '1' is satisfied, and (1,2)'s '1' is also satisfied because it's a bomb. But wait, (1,2) is a '1', so it can't be a bomb; it's a number. So that can't be.\n\nWait, no. (1,2) is a '1', meaning it's a safe square with one adjacent bomb. So the bomb can't be at (1,2), but it could be adjacent to it.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a square that's surrounded by the least number of possibilities. For example, (4,0) is a '1', so it has one bomb in its adjacent squares. The possible bombs could be at (3,0), (5,0), (4,1), (3,1), or (5,1). But (4,1) is a '1', so it can't be a bomb. So the bomb must be in one of the other squares.\n\nIf I could reveal one of these, maybe I can get more info. But since I don't want to reveal a bomb, maybe I should choose a square that's less likely to be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag where I'm fairly certain there's a bomb. But I don't have enough info yet.\n\nWait, looking at (1,3) as a '2', if I can find two bombs around it, that would help. Let's say one bomb is at (1,4), then the other could be at (2,3). But I don't know yet.\n\nI think I need to make a move that gives me the most information. Maybe revealing a square that's adjacent to a '1' or '2' could help. For example, revealing (0,2) could tell me if it's a bomb or another number, which would help with (0,3)'s '1'.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (1,4) could help with both (0,3)'s '1' and (1,3)'s '2'.\n\nBut I'm not sure if (1,4) is a bomb or not. If I reveal it and it's a bomb, the game ends, which I don't want. So maybe I should choose a square that's less likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at the board, the bottom rows (5-9) are all unexplored. Maybe revealing a square there could give me a number, which would help in deducing the rest.\n\nBut that's a bit risky because I don't know what's there. Alternatively, maybe I should look for a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, making it more likely to be a bomb.\n\nWait, maybe (2,2) is a bomb because it's adjacent to (1,1)'s '1' and (1,2)'s '1'. If (2,2) is a bomb, then both (1,1) and (1,2) would be satisfied. That seems plausible.\n\nIf I could confirm that, then I could place a flag there. But I don't know yet. Alternatively, I could reveal (2,2) to see if it's a bomb or a number.\n\nBut again, if it's a bomb, the game ends. So maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAnother idea: since the '1's in rows 0,1,2,3,4 are all in the leftmost columns, maybe the bombs are along the left edge. For example, (0,0) could be a bomb, but (0,0) is revealed as '_', so it's empty. So maybe the bombs are in the first few columns.\n\nLooking at (4,0) as a '1', if the bomb is at (3,0), then (4,0)'s '1' is satisfied. But (3,0) is '_', so it's empty. Wait, no, (3,0) is '_', meaning it's been revealed as empty. So the bomb can't be there. So the bomb must be elsewhere around (4,0). Maybe (5,0) is a bomb. But (5,0) is '.', unexplored.\n\nWait, no, (3,0) is '_', so it's empty. So the bomb near (4,0) must be at (5,0) or (4,1) or (3,1). But (4,1) is a '1', so it can't be a bomb. So the bomb must be at (5,0) or (3,1). But (3,1) is a '1' in row 3, so it's a number, not a bomb. So the bomb must be at (5,0). So maybe (5,0) is a bomb.\n\nIf that's the case, then (4,0)'s '1' is satisfied. Also, (5,0) would be a bomb, which would affect any adjacent numbers. For example, (5,1) would have a '1' if it's adjacent to (5,0). But (5,1) is '.' so we don't know yet.\n\nSo if I place a flag at (5,0), that might be correct. But I need to make sure that it doesn't conflict with any numbers.\n\nWait, (4,0) is a '1', and if (5,0) is a bomb, that's fine because (4,0) only needs one bomb. Also, (5,0) is adjacent to (5,1), which if it's a number, would have to account for that bomb.\n\nBut since (5,1) is unexplored, I don't know yet. So placing a flag at (5,0) seems possible.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,0) is safe, and the bomb is elsewhere. But given that (4,0) is a '1' and (3,0) is empty, the bomb must be at (5,0) or (4,1). But (4,1) is a '1', so it can't be a bomb. Therefore, the bomb must be at (5,0).\n\nSo I think placing a flag at (5,0) is a good move because it satisfies (4,0)'s '1' without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nWait, but (5,0) is in row 5, which is all unexplored. If I place a flag there, I might be using one of my 10 flags. But I have 10 flags remaining, so that's okay.\n\nBut I should also check if placing a flag at (5,0) would cause any conflicts with other numbers. For example, if (5,1) is a number, it would have to account for the bomb at (5,0). But since (5,1) is unexplored, I can't know yet. So it's possible that placing a flag there is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (5,0) instead of flagging it. But if it's a bomb, the game ends, which I don't want. So flagging it is safer if I'm confident it's a bomb.\n\nGiven the information, I think (5,0) is the most likely location for a bomb based on (4,0)'s '1' and the absence of other possibilities around it. So I'll place a flag there.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the '1' at (4,0), the bomb must be adjacent. Since (3,0) is empty, the bomb is likely at (5,0). Placing a flag here satisfies the '1' without conflicting with other numbers.\n\nMOVE: 5,0,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n1 _ 1 1 2 . . . . . .\n2 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n3 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 1, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board and the information given.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with 10 bombs in total. There are 9 flags remaining, which means I can place up to 9 flags. The current board has some revealed numbers and one flagged square at (5,0), which is position (5,0).\n\nLet me go through each step as per the analysis steps.\n\nFirst, I need to check all revealed numbers against existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. Looking at the board, I see a few numbers:\n\n- At (0,3), there's a 1.\n- At (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), there are 1s and a 2.\n- At (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1) there are 1s and a 2.\n\nWait, let me list all the revealed numbers:\n\nRow 0: (0,3) is 1.\n\nRow 1: (1,1) is 1, (1,2) is 1, (1,3) is 2.\n\nRow 2: (2,1) is 1.\n\nRow 3: (3,1) is 1.\n\nRow 4: (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is 1.\n\nRow 5: (5,0) is F (flagged).\n\nThe rest are unexplored or empty.\n\nNow, I need to check if any of these numbers have adjacent flags that might conflict.\n\nStarting with (0,3) which is 1. It's in row 0, column 3. The adjacent squares would be:\n\n(0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). None of these are flagged, so no conflict here.\n\nNext, (1,1) is 1. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2),\n\n(1,0), (1,2),\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nLooking at these, (1,0) is not flagged, (1,2) is 1, so no flags here either.\n\n(1,2) is 1. Adjacent squares:\n\n(0,1), (0,2), (0,3),\n\n(1,1), (1,3),\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nAgain, no flags nearby.\n\n(1,3) is 2. Adjacent squares:\n\n(0,2), (0,3), (0,4),\n\n(1,2), (1,4),\n\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nNo flags here either.\n\nMoving to (2,1) which is 1. Adjacent squares:\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2),\n\n(2,0), (2,2),\n\n(3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\n\nNo flags nearby.\n\n(3,1) is 1. Adjacent squares:\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2),\n\n(3,0), (3,2),\n\n(4,0), (4,1), (4,2).\n\nLooking at these, (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is 1. So no flags here.\n\n(4,0) is 1. Adjacent squares:\n\n(3,0), (3,1),\n\n(4,1),\n\n(5,0), (5,1).\n\nWait, (5,0) is F, which is a flag. So (4,0) is 1, and it has a flag at (5,0). That means the number 1 at (4,0) is satisfied by that one flag. So no conflict here because the number is 1, and there's exactly one flag adjacent. So that's fine.\n\n(4,1) is 1. Adjacent squares:\n\n(3,0), (3,1), (3,2),\n\n(4,0), (4,2),\n\n(5,0), (5,1), (5,2).\n\nHere, (5,0) is F. So the number at (4,1) is 1, and it has one flag adjacent, which is correct. So no conflict.\n\nNow, the only flag on the board is at (5,0). Let's check if any number is conflicting with it.\n\nLooking at (4,0) which is 1. It has (5,0) as a flag. So that's correct.\n\nLooking at (5,1), which is unexplored. If I were to flag (5,1), I need to check if any adjacent numbers would be affected.\n\nWait, but before that, let me consider the next steps.\n\nThe next step is to look for obvious conflicts. I don't see any because all the numbers seem to have the correct number of adjacent flags. For example, (4,0) is 1 and has exactly one flag at (5,0). Similarly, (4,1) is 1 and has one flag at (5,0). So no conflicts there.\n\nNext, consider the remaining flags vs bombs. There are 10 bombs in total, and flags remaining are 9. So I can place up to 9 flags. But since the board is 10x10, and some squares are already revealed, I need to be careful where to place the flags.\n\nNow, the next step is to decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile. I should look for tiles that are likely to be bombs based on the numbers around them.\n\nLooking at the board, let's see. Maybe I can find a tile that must be a bomb because the numbers around it require it.\n\nFor example, looking at (4,0) which is 1. It's adjacent to (5,0) which is F. So the only possible bomb adjacent to (4,0) is (5,0). Therefore, (5,0) must be a bomb, which is why it's flagged.\n\nNow, looking at (4,1) which is 1. It has (5,0) as a flag. But (4,1) is 1, so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (5,0) is already a bomb, that satisfies it. Therefore, the other adjacent squares to (4,1) must not have any bombs. So the squares around (4,1) like (3,1), (4,2), (5,1), etc., must be safe.\n\nWait, but (5,1) is unexplored. If I can figure out whether it's a bomb or not, that might help.\n\nLooking at (5,0) is F, so it's a bomb. Therefore, any squares adjacent to it must not have any other bombs because the numbers around them would have to account for that.\n\nWait, let me think again. The square at (4,0) is 1, and it's adjacent to (5,0), which is a bomb. So that satisfies the count for (4,0). Therefore, the other squares around (4,0), like (3,0), (4,1), etc., must not have bombs because the count is already met.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is 1, and it's adjacent to (5,0), which is a bomb, so that's the only bomb it needs. Therefore, the other adjacent squares to (4,1) must not have bombs.\n\nSo, for example, (5,1) is adjacent to (4,1) which is 1, and (5,0) which is a bomb. So (5,1) can't be a bomb because (4,1) is already counting (5,0) as its only bomb. Therefore, (5,1) must be safe. So revealing (5,1) would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find another square that is definitely a bomb. Let's look around.\n\nLooking at row 1, (1,3) is 2. It's adjacent to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). None of these are flagged except (5,0), which is far away. So (1,3) is 2, meaning it has two bombs adjacent to it. So I need to find two bombs around it.\n\nBut looking at the current board, I don't see any other flags or revealed bombs, so maybe placing a flag near (1,3) could help, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAnother approach is to look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which might indicate where the bombs are.\n\nFor example, looking at (2,1) which is 1. It's adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). Since (2,1) is 1, it has exactly one bomb adjacent. But none of these are flagged yet, except (5,0), which is not adjacent. So the bomb must be in one of these squares.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is 1, adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Again, (4,0) is 1, which is already accounted for by (5,0). So the bomb for (3,1) must be elsewhere, perhaps (4,2) or (3,2), etc.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to find a square that is adjacent to a number that can only be satisfied by a specific square being a bomb.\n\nFor example, looking at (0,3) which is 1. Its adjacent squares are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). Since (0,3) is 1, one of these must be a bomb. But none are flagged yet, so maybe I can flag one of them if possible.\n\nBut I have 9 flags remaining, so I can place flags where I'm certain. However, I don't have enough information yet to be certain about any of these squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for squares that are surrounded by numbers that would require them to be bombs.\n\nWait, let me think about (5,0) which is F. Since it's a flag, it's considered a bomb. So any squares adjacent to it must not have more than the required number of bombs.\n\nLooking at (5,0), the adjacent squares are (4,0), (5,1), (6,0). (4,0) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,0). So (5,1) and (6,0) can't be bombs because (4,0) is already counting (5,0) as its only bomb.\n\nTherefore, (5,1) must be safe. So revealing (5,1) would be safe.\n\nSo, I think the next move should be to reveal (5,1) because it's safe. That would help me get more information about the board.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another square. Let's see.\n\nLooking at (4,1) which is 1. It's adjacent to (5,0) which is a bomb, so the other adjacent squares must be safe. Therefore, (5,1) is safe. So revealing (5,1) would be a good move because it's definitely safe, and it would open up that square, potentially revealing more numbers or empty spaces.\n\nSo, I think the next move should be to reveal (5,1). Therefore, the move would be (5,1) with flag=false.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I reveal (5,1), what could happen? Since (5,1) is adjacent to (4,1) which is 1, and (5,0) which is a bomb, (5,1) must be safe. So revealing it would either show a number or an empty space, but it won't be a bomb. Therefore, it's safe to reveal.\n\nSo, the move is to reveal (5,1).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (5,1) is safe because it's adjacent to (4,1), which is 1, and (5,0), which is a flagged bomb. Since (4,1) is already satisfied by (5,0), (5,1) cannot be a bomb and must be safe to reveal.\n\nMOVE: 5,1,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n1 _ 1 1 2 . . . . . .\n2 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n3 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n5 F . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
