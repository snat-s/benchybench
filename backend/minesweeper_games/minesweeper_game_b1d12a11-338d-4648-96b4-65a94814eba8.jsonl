{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 7, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nLet me analyze the current Minesweeper board state to determine a safe move.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the board systematically, looking for definite safe moves or positions where I need to flag a mine.\n\nStarting with the top section:\n- In row 0, we have a '1' at (0,1) which means there's one mine adjacent to it.\n- In row 1, we see numbers \"1 1 1 1\" followed by a \"2 1 1\". The '2' at (1,6) indicates two adjacent mines.\n- In row 2, we have \"1 1 2\" followed by \"1\".\n\nLooking at the mid-section:\n- Row 3 has \"1 1 1\"\n- Row 4 starts with \"1 1 1\"\n- Row 5 has a \"1\"\n- Row 6 has a \"2 1\" followed by \"1 2 2 1\"\n- Row 7 has a \"1\" followed by \"1\"\n- Row 8 has a \"1 1 1 2\"\n\nI need to find patterns where I can deduce the location of mines or safe squares. Let's look for:\n1. Numbers with all adjacent unexplored squares being mines\n2. Numbers where I can determine some adjacent unexplored squares are safe\n\nLet's start with the left side of the board:\n\nAt (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), we have three '1's. Looking at (5,0) and (5,1), these unexplored squares are likely where mines are. At least one of them must be a mine, but we don't know which one yet.\n\nThe '1' at (5,2) suggests there's a mine in one of its adjacent unexplored squares.\n\nLet me check the middle section:\n\nAt (2,7), there's an unexplored square. The adjacent revealed numbers are:\n- (1,6): '2' \n- (1,7): '1'\n- (1,8): '1'\n- (2,6): '2'\n- (2,8): '1'\n- (3,6): '1'\n- (3,7): '1'\n- (3,8): '1'\n\nLooking at (1,6) = '2', its adjacent unexplored squares include (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), and (2,7). Given the surrounding numbers, I need to analyze this area carefully.\n\nSimilarly, at (6,7) and (6,8), both showing '2', there's a pattern to analyze.\n\nLet me look at more specific areas:\n\nFor (1,6) = '2', it's adjacent to:\n- (0,5), (0,6), (0,7): Unexplored\n- (1,5), (1,7): One is unexplored, one is revealed as '1'\n- (2,5), (2,6), (2,7): One is unexplored, two are revealed as '1' and '2'\n\nGiven the '2' at (1,6), there must be exactly 2 mines in its adjacent squares. Since there are multiple unexplored squares around it, I can't immediately determine which ones are mines.\n\nLet me look at (6,7) = '2' and (6,8) = '2':\nFor (6,7), it's adjacent to:\n- (5,6), (5,7), (5,8): Unexplored\n- (6,6), (6,8): Revealed as '1' and '2'\n- (7,6), (7,7), (7,8): One is revealed as '1', two are unexplored\n\nFor (6,8), it's adjacent to:\n- (5,7), (5,8), (5,9): Unexplored\n- (6,7), (6,9): Revealed as '2' and '1'\n- (7,7), (7,8), (7,9): All unexplored\n\nThis is a complex pattern. I need to analyze it carefully.\n\nLet me focus on a specific area that might give me a definite move:\n\nLooking at (7,6) = '1', it's adjacent to:\n- (6,5), (6,6), (6,7): All revealed as '1', '1', and '2'\n- (7,5), (7,7): One is unexplored, one is unexplored\n- (8,5), (8,6), (8,7): All revealed as '1', '1', and '2'\n\nSince (7,6) indicates exactly one mine in its adjacents, and all its adjacents are either revealed or unexplored, one of the unexplored adjacents must contain a mine.\n\nLet me look more systematically at the top-right corner:\n\nAt (0,6) = '1', it's adjacent to:\n- (0,5), (0,7): Both unexplored\n- (1,5), (1,6), (1,7): Revealed as '1', '2', and '1'\n\nSo, either (0,5) or (0,7) contains a mine.\n\nI need to find a pattern where I can make a safe move. Let me continue analyzing.\n\nI'll look at (2,6) = '2'. It's adjacent to:\n- (1,5), (1,6), (1,7): Revealed as '1', '2', and '1'\n- (2,5), (2,7): Revealed as '1', unexplored\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,7): All revealed as empty, '1', and '1'\n\nSince (2,6) indicates 2 mines and we've already accounted for all revealed adjacents, the unexplored (2,7) must contain a mine.\n\nAlso, let me check if there are any obvious safe reveals:\n\nAt (0,0), it's adjacent to:\n- (0,1): Revealed as '1'\n- (1,0), (1,1): Unexplored, revealed as '1'\n\nWe can't immediately determine if (0,0) is safe.\n\nLet me analyze row 6 more carefully:\n\nAt (6,3) = '1', it's adjacent to:\n- (5,2), (5,3), (5,4): Revealed as '1', unexplored, unexplored\n- (6,2), (6,4): Revealed as '2', unexplored\n- (7,2), (7,3), (7,4): Unexplored, revealed as '1', unexplored\n\nGiven that (6,3) indicates exactly one mine in its adjacents, and we have multiple unexplored adjacents, we can't immediately determine which one is the mine.\n\nAh, let's look at (2,6) = '2' again: It indicates 2 mines in its adjacent squares. One of those has to be (2,7) since the rest of the surrounding squares are revealed and don't contain mines.\n\nSo, it seems like (2,7) is definitely a mine. I should flag it.\n\nMOVE: 2,7,true (flagging the position at row 2, column 7 as a mine)\n\nWait, let me double-check my analysis to be sure.\n\n(2,6) = '2' means exactly 2 mines in its 8 adjacent squares:\n- (1,5), (1,6), (1,7): These are revealed as '1', '2', '1'. They don't contain mines.\n- (2,5): Revealed as '1'. Not a mine.\n- (2,7): Unexplored. Potential mine.\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,7): Revealed as empty, '1', '1'. Not mines.\n\nSo, I've accounted for 7 of the 8 adjacent squares to (2,6), and none of them contain mines. The 8th square, (2,7), must contain a mine since (2,6) indicates exactly 2 mines.\n\nWait, I think I may have made a mistake. Let me count again:\nThe 8 adjacent squares to (2,6) are:\n(1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n\nAh, I think I see the issue. I haven't factored in mines that might be outside the revealed portion of the board.\n\nLet me rethink my approach. If (2,6) indicates 2 mines, and I haven't seen any flags yet, then I can't be certain which adjacent squares contain mines without more information.\n\nActually, let's try a different approach. The rules provided say there are 10 bombs total, and we have 10 flags remaining. So we haven't flagged any mines yet.\n\nLet me look for patterns where I can determine a safe move:\n\nThe '1' at (2,8) means one mine is adjacent to it. Its adjacents are:\n- (1,7), (1,8), (1,9): Revealed as '1', '1', unexplored\n- (2,7), (2,9): Unexplored, unexplored\n- (3,7), (3,8), (3,9): Revealed as '1', '1', unexplored\n\nGiven the constraints, either (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), or (3,9) must contain a mine.\n\nBut I need more constraints to determine a definite move. Let me continue analyzing.\n\nActually, I think my initial analysis was correct. Let's examine (2,6) = '2' again. It has 8 adjacent squares:\n(1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n\nOf these, (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7) are revealed and don't contain mines. That means (2,7) must contain a mine, and I should flag it.\n\nSo, I think the correct move is to flag (2,7).\n\nOh wait, my logic above has a flaw. I need to check if the positions I listed as \"revealed and don't contain mines\" are actually safe. Let me re-verify.\n\nLet's see:\n- (1,5) is unexplored (empty from the board state)\n- (1,6) is revealed as '2'\n- (1,7) is revealed as '1'\n- (2,5) is revealed as '1'\n- (3,5) is unexplored (empty from the board state)\n- (3,6) is revealed as '1'\n- (3,7) is revealed as '1'\n\nSo, of the 8 adjacents to (2,6), at least (1,5) and (3,5) are unexplored and could contain mines. Given that (2,6) indicates 2 mines, and we have 3 unexplored adjacents ((1,5), (2,7), and (3,5)), we can't immediately determine which ones are mines without more constraints.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's look at areas where we can make a definite move.\n\nI notice that the '1' at (7,6) has multiple unexplored adjacent squares. Similarly, the '2' at (8,6) has multiple unexplored adjacent squares.\n\nLet me check if I can find a position where all unexplored adjacent squares must be mines, or where all unexplored adjacent squares must be safe.\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake in my visualization. Let me reinterpret the board state:\n\nThe underscores (_) are revealed empty spaces.\nThe periods (.) are unexplored spaces.\nNumbers (1-8) are revealed spaces with a number indicating adjacent bombs.\n\nGiven this interpretation, let me analyze (2,6) = '2' again.\n\nIts adjacents are:\n- (1,5): Unexplored\n- (1,6): Revealed as '2'\n- (1,7): Revealed as '1'\n- (2,5): Revealed as '1'\n- (2,7): Unexplored\n- (3,5): Empty (revealed)\n- (3,6): Empty (revealed)\n- (3,7): Revealed as '1'\n\nSo, out of the 8 adjacents, only (1,5) and (2,7) are unexplored. Given that (2,6) indicates 2 mines and none of the revealed adjacents are mines, both (1,5) and (2,7) must contain mines. So, I should flag both.\n\nLet's double-check this: (2,6) indicates 2 mines. None of the revealed adjacents are mines, so the 2 mines must be in the 2 unexplored adjacents: (1,5) and (2,7).\n\nSo, I'll flag (2,7).\n\nMOVE: 2,7,true (flagging the position at row 2, column 7 as a mine)\n\nActually, if I'm flagging (2,7), I should also flag (1,5) based on the logic above. But let me check if there's a more pressing move.\n\nLet me analyze (6,7) = '2' and (6,8) = '2'. The adjacents to (6,7) are:\n- (5,6): Unexplored\n- (5,7): Unexplored\n- (5,8): Unexplored\n- (6,6): Revealed as '1'\n- (6,8): Revealed as '2'\n- (7,6): Revealed as '1'\n- (7,7): Unexplored\n- (7,8): Unexplored\n\nSo, out of the 8 adjacents, 5 are unexplored. Given that (6,7) indicates 2 mines, and none of the revealed adjacents are mines, 2 out of the 5 unexplored adjacents must contain mines.\n\nSimilarly, the adjacents to (6,8) are:\n- (5,7): Unexplored\n- (5,8): Unexplored\n- (5,9): Unexplored\n- (6,7): Revealed as '2'\n- (6,9): Revealed as '1'\n- (7,7): Unexplored\n- (7,8): Unexplored\n- (7,9): Unexplored\n\nOut of the 8 adjacents, 6 are unexplored. Given that (6,8) indicates 2 mines, and none of the revealed adjacents are mines, 2 out of the 6 unexplored adjacents must contain mines.\n\nThis doesn't give me a definite move yet. Let me continue analyzing.\n\nLet's try the top-right corner.\n\nThe '1' at (0,6) has adjacents:\n- (0,5): Unexplored\n- (0,7): Unexplored\n- (1,5): Unexplored\n- (1,6): Revealed as '2'\n- (1,7): Revealed as '1'\n\nOut of the 5 adjacents, 3 are unexplored. Given that (0,6) indicates 1 mine, and none of the revealed adjacents are mines, 1 out of the 3 unexplored adjacents must contain a mine.\n\nThis doesn't give me a definite move either. Let me check other areas.\n\nActually, I think my initial logic about flagging (2,7) is solid. If (2,6) indicates 2 mines, and its only unexplored adjacents are (1,5) and (2,7), then both must be mines. So I'll flag (2,7).\n\nMOVE: 2,7,true (flagging the position at row 2, column 7 as a mine)\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the board carefully, I need to find a definite move. I'll focus on the numbered tiles and their adjacents.\n\nFirst, I notice the '2' at position (2,6) - this means exactly 2 mines in its 8 adjacent squares. Let me analyze this position:\n\nThe 8 squares adjacent to (2,6) are:\n- (1,5): Unexplored\n- (1,6): Revealed as '2'\n- (1,7): Revealed as '1'\n- (2,5): Revealed as '1'\n- (2,7): Unexplored\n- (3,5): Empty (revealed)\n- (3,6): Empty (revealed)\n- (3,7): Revealed as '1'\n\nOf these 8 adjacent squares, only 2 are unexplored: (1,5) and (2,7). Since position (2,6) tells us there are exactly 2 mines adjacent to it, and we've identified only 2 unexplored squares, both of these unexplored squares MUST contain mines.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently place a flag at (2,7).\n\nEXPLANATION: The '2' at position (2,6) has only two unexplored adjacent squares: (1,5) and (2,7). Since it must have exactly 2 mines adjacent to it, both must be mines.

The 2 at (1,6) is satisfied with the flag at (2,7) and likely another bomb adjacent to it.\n2. The 2 at (2,6) is similarly satisfied with the flag at (2,7) and another adjacent bomb.\n3. The 2 at (6,7) indicates two bombs in its surroundings.\n4. The 2 at (6,8) also indicates two bombs in its surroundings.\n5. The 2 at (8,6) indicates two bombs in its surroundings.\n6. The 2 at (6,2) indicates two bombs in its surroundings.\n\nLet me identify any safe moves based on the current state:\n\nAt (0,1), the 1 is likely satisfied by a bomb to its left or top-left. \n\nThe 1 at (4,0) is satisfied by a bomb either at (3,0), (3,1), or (5,0).\n\nLooking at the sequence in row 6, the 1 at (6,3) and the 1 at (6,6) might give us some insights.\n\nLet's focus on the area around (6,7) and (6,8), both of which are 2s. The only unexplored cells around them are (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), and we need to place 4 bombs (2 for each of the 2s).\n\nLet's also look at the 2 at (6,2). The cells around it are (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). Among these, (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3) are unexplored, and we need to place 2 bombs.\n\nI'm trying to identify a definite safe move based on the constraints.\n\nThe 1 at (4,0) has unexplored cells at (3,0) and (3,1). Since it indicates one bomb, and there are two possible positions, we can't be sure which one has the bomb.\n\nWait, let's check the 1 at (0,1). It has unexplored cells at (0,0), (1,0). Again, since it indicates one bomb, and there are two possible positions, we can't be sure which one has the bomb.\n\nLet's zoom in on the left middle of the board. The 1 at (4,2) has several unexplored cells around it, including (5,2). But wait, (5,2) already has a 1 on it, so it's a revealed cell, not unexplored. The unexplored cells around (4,2) are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (5,1), and (5,3). We only need one bomb, but with 5 possible positions, we can't determine definitively where it is.\n\nLet's focus on the right side of the board. The 1 at (6,6) suggests there's one bomb in its surroundings. The unexplored cells around it are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). With 6 possible positions for one bomb, we can't be sure where it is.\n\nI'm still looking for a definite safe move...\n\nActually, I should check for any constraints that can be derived by looking at multiple numbers together.\n\nLet's consider the 2s at (6,7) and (6,8). The overlapping unexplored cells around them are (5,7), (5,8), (7,7), (7,8). We need a total of 4 bombs for these two 2s. If all 4 of these cells had bombs, then the 1 at (6,6) would have more than one bomb adjacent to it (specifically, (5,7) and (7,7) would both have bombs), which contradicts the fact that the 1 indicates only one adjacent bomb. So, not all 4 of these cells can have bombs. But given the constraints, I can't definitively determine which of these cells are safe.\n\nThe 1 at (8,6) and the 2 at (8,6) share unexplored cells (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). The 1 needs one bomb, and the 2 needs two. With 6 possible positions for 3 bombs, I can't determine definitively where they are.\n\nLet's look at the top right of the board. The 1 at (0,6) has unexplored cells at (0,5), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9). With 5 possible positions for one bomb, I can't be sure which one has the bomb.\n\nHmm, it's quite a challenging board state. I'm trying to find a definite safe move, but it's not immediately obvious.\n\nLet's check the 1s at (3,6), (3,7), and (3,8). The unexplored cells around them are (2,5), (2,6), (2,8), (2,9), (3,5), (3,9), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). We need a total of 3 bombs, but with 11 potential positions, it's hard to determine where they are.\n\nLet's go back to the flag at (2,7). It helps satisfy the 2s at (1,6) and (2,6). But the 1 at (2,8) also has this flag adjacent to it, which means there can't be any more bombs adjacent to (2,8). So, the cells at (1,7), (1,9), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9) should be safe.\n\nActually, wait. The 1 at (2,8) means it has exactly one adjacent bomb. We already know one such bomb at (2,7). So, the rest of the cells adjacent to (2,8) must be safe. These are:\n- (1,7), which is already revealed as a 1\n- (1,8), which is already revealed as a 1\n- (1,9), which is unexplored\n- (2,9), which is unexplored\n- (3,7), which is already revealed as a 1\n- (3,8), which is already revealed as a 1\n- (3,9), which is unexplored\n\nSo, (1,9), (2,9), and (3,9) should be safe to reveal.\n\nLet's double-check: the 1 at (2,8) has a flag at (2,7), which means all other adjacent cells are safe. \n\nAlright, I believe (1,9) is a safe move. Let's go with that.\n\nWait, the 1 at (1,8) must have a bomb adjacent to it. The cells adjacent to it are (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). Among these, we know (2,7) is flagged as a bomb, and many others are revealed (and therefore safe). The unexplored cells are (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9). The flagged bomb is at (2,7), so there can't be any more bombs adjacent to (1,8).

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 5, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nLet me analyze the current Minesweeper board state:\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's revealed and make observations about the current state.\n\nI see a 10x10 board with some revealed safe squares (showing numbers or empty spaces), some flagged squares (marked with F), and some unexplored squares (marked with .).\n\nThere are 10 bombs total in the game, and 9 flags remaining. So far, only 1 flag has been placed at position (2,7), marked as F.\n\nI'll first look for any obvious moves:\n\n1. At row 0, column 1, there's a \"1\" which indicates there's 1 bomb in the adjacent 8 squares. Since the squares below and to the right are revealed as safe, the bomb must be in one of the unexplored squares: (0,0), (0,8), or (0,9).\n\n2. At row 1, column 5, there's an empty space. All surrounding spaces are already revealed except for (0,5).\n\n3. At row 2, column 7, there's a flag placed, indicating a presumed bomb.\n\n4. Looking at row 2, column 6 (value \"2\"), it has one adjacent flag at (2,7). Since it indicates there are 2 bombs adjacent, there must be another bomb nearby, likely at (1,7), (1,6), or (3,7).\n\n5. Looking at row 2, column 8 (value \"1\"), it already has one adjacent flag at (2,7), so all other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nLet's carefully analyze some of these potential moves:\n\n**For the \"2\" at position (2,6)**:\nIt has adjacent squares at:\n- (1,5) - revealed as \".\"\n- (1,6) - revealed as \"2\"\n- (1,7) - revealed as \"1\"\n- (2,5) - revealed as \"1\"\n- (2,7) - flagged as \"F\"\n- (3,5) - revealed as \"_\"\n- (3,6) - revealed as \"1\"\n- (3,7) - revealed as \"1\"\n\nSince the \"2\" at (2,6) indicates there are exactly 2 bombs adjacent, and one is already flagged at (2,7), there must be one more bomb among its adjacent squares. However, most of these squares are already revealed as safe, which means they can't contain bombs. The only unrevealed square adjacent to (2,6) is (1,5). So, (1,5) must contain a bomb.\n\n**For the \"1\" at position (2,8)**:\nIt has adjacent squares at:\n- (1,7) - revealed as \"1\"\n- (1,8) - revealed as \"1\"\n- (1,9) - unexplored\n- (2,7) - flagged as \"F\"\n- (2,9) - unexplored\n- (3,7) - revealed as \"1\"\n- (3,8) - revealed as \"1\"\n- (3,9) - unexplored\n\nSince the \"1\" at (2,8) indicates there's exactly 1 bomb adjacent, and there's already a flag at (2,7), all other adjacent squares must be safe. This means (1,9), (2,9), and (3,9) are safe.\n\nWait, I made a mistake in my analysis of the board. Let me carefully read the BOARD LEGEND and COORDINATE SYSTEM to ensure I understand the notation correctly.\n\nOk, so:\n- The first number in coordinates is the row (x), starting from 0 at the top.\n- The second number in coordinates is the column (y), starting from 0 at the left.\n- \"_\" represents empty revealed spaces.\n- \".\" represents unexplored spaces.\n- \"F\" represents flagged spaces.\n\nLet me re-analyze:\n\nLooking at the \"2\" at row 2, column 6 (coordinates (2,6)):\n- Adjacent cells: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n- From the board: (1,5) is \".\", (1,6) is \"2\", (1,7) is \"1\", (2,5) is \"1\", (2,7) is \"F\", (3,5) is \"_\", (3,6) is \"_\", (3,7) is \"1\"\n- Since (2,6) is a \"2\", there are exactly 2 bombs in adjacent cells.\n- One bomb is already flagged at (2,7).\n- So, there's one more bomb, and it must be at (1,5) since all other adjacent cells are revealed as safe.\n\nLet's flag (1,5) as a bomb.\n\nEXPLANATION: The \"2\" at position (2,6) indicates there are exactly 2 bombs adjacent. One is already flagged at (2,7), and all other adjacent cells are revealed as safe except for (1,5). Thus, (1,5) must contain a bomb.\nMOVE: 1,5,true\n\nWait, I need to be more careful with my reading of the board. Let me ensure I understand the coordinates correctly.\n\nThe board is represented as:\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . . . 1 _ _ _\n1 _ 1 1 1 1 . 2 1 1 _\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 F 1 _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n4 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . 2 1 _ _ 1 2 2 1\n7 . . . 1 _ _ 1 . . .\n8 . . . 1 1 1 2 . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n\nSo, for example, the \"2\" I was referring to earlier is at position (2,6), which means row 2 and column 6.\n\nLooking at the coordinates, I see:\n- From the board, the cell at row 2, column 6 (position (2,6)) has a value of \"2\".\n- Adjacent cells to position (2,6) are (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7).\n- From the board, these cells have values: (1,5) is \".\", (1,6) is \"2\", (1,7) is \"1\", (2,5) is \"1\", (2,7) is \"F\", (3,5) is \"_\", (3,6) is \"1\", (3,7) is \"1\".\n\nThe \"2\" at position (2,6) indicates that there are exactly 2 bombs adjacent to it. One is already flagged at (2,7). So, there's one more bomb, and it must be in one of the adjacent cells.\n\nMost of the adjacent cells are already revealed, meaning they can't contain bombs. The unexplored cell adjacent to (2,6) is (1,5). Given the constraint that there's one more bomb adjacent to (2,6), and (1,5) is the only unrevealed adjacent cell, (1,5) must contain a bomb.\n\nSo, I should flag (1,5) as a bomb.\n\nEXPLANATION: The \"2\" at position (2,6) indicates there are exactly 2 bombs adjacent. One is already flagged at (2,7), and all other adjacent cells are revealed as safe except for (1,5). Thus, (1,5) must contain a bomb.\nMOVE: 1,5,true\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the board carefully, I can see several important clues:\n\nAt position (2,6), there's a \"2\" which indicates two adjacent bombs.

Looking at all eight surrounding cells, I notice:\n- (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7) are the adjacent cells\n- Of these, (2,7) is already flagged\n- All other adjacent cells EXCEPT (1,5) have been revealed as safe\n\nSince the \"2\" at (2,6) needs exactly two bombs adjacent to it, and we've already accounted for one at (2,7), the remaining bomb must be at the only unexplored adjacent cell: (1,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: The \"2\" at position (2,6) indicates exactly 2 bombs adjacent. With one already flagged at (2,7) and all other adjacent cells revealed as safe except for (1,5), the cell at (1,5) must contain a bomb.\nMOVE: 1,5,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . . . 1 _ _ _\n1 _ 1 1 1 1 . 2 1 1 _\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 F 1 _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n4 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . 2 1 _ _ 1 2 2 1\n7 . . . 1 _ _ 1 . . .\n8 . . . 1 1 1 2 . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

We can check its neighbors:\n- Above: Out of bounds\n- Right: Unexplored\n- Below: Revealed \"1\"\n- Left: Revealed \"Empty\"\n- Diagonals: Three unexplored, one revealed empty\nSo there must be a bomb in one of the unexplored neighbors. But we can't determine which one yet.\n\nAt (1,1): There's a \"1\", its neighbors:\n- Left: Revealed empty\n- Above: Unexplored\n- Right: Revealed \"1\"\n- Below: Revealed empty\n- Diagonals: Mix of revealed and unexplored\nThe bomb must be in an unexplored cell, likely the one above at (0,0).\n\nI'll continue this analysis, but let's look for more definitive conclusions.\n\nAt (1,6): There's a \"2\", its neighbors:\n- Left: Flagged at (1,5)\n- There's already 1 flag adjacent, so there must be 1 more bomb in its neighbors\n- Looking at its neighbors, I see it already has one flag (at (1,5)), so there's one more bomb adjacent.\n- Checking the other adjacent positions, some are revealed safe, but (0,5), (0,6), and (0,7) are unexplored.\n- At (2,7) there's already a flag, which is diagonally adjacent. So among (0,5), (0,6), and (0,7), there must be another bomb.\n\nLet me look at (2,6): It has a \"2\", which means 2 bombs adjacent. One flag is already present at (2,7). So there's one more bomb to be found among its unexplored neighbors. \n\nLet's check (6,6) which has a \"1\". Its neighbors include (6,7) and (7,6) which are unexplored. There must be a bomb in one of those positions.\n\nLooking at (7,6) which also has a \"1\". Its neighbors include (6,7) and (7,7) which are unexplored. There must be a bomb in one of those positions.\n\nHmm, combining the information from (6,6) and (7,6), both indicate a bomb in their unexplored neighbors. The overlap is position (6,7), so that's likely a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, let's check position (8,6) which has a \"2\". Looking at its neighbors, several are unexplored, but based on the pattern, one of them is likely (7,7).\n\nLet me look at (6,7) which has a \"2\". Its neighbors include (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), and (7,7) which are unexplored. Based on the analysis above, (7,7) is likely a bomb. There should be one more.\n\nLet me check position (6,8) which has a \"2\". Its neighbors include (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), and (7,8) which are unexplored. There must be 2 bombs among these positions.\n\nBased on this analysis, I think (6,7) is definitely a position where we should place a flag, as it's indicated by both (6,6) and (7,6) to contain a bomb.\n\nActually, let me double check this conclusion. \n- (6,6) has a \"1\", meaning one bomb adjacent. That means one of (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) must be a bomb.\n- (7,6) has a \"1\", meaning one bomb adjacent. That means one of (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7) must be a bomb.\n- (6,6) is a revealed \"1\", not a bomb.\n- The common positions between these two sets of neighbors are (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), and (7,7).\n- Given that both (6,6) and (7,6) indicate exactly one bomb each in their neighborhoods, and they share these positions, the bomb must be in one of these common positions.\n\nLet me check if (6,5) or (7,5) are ruled out by other revealed numbers:\n- For (6,5): It's adjacent to an unexplored area, so we can't determine yet.\n- For (7,5): It's adjacent to an unexplored area, so we can't determine yet.\n\nI need to be careful about my conclusion. Let's look more broadly.\n\nI see that in the bottom right corner, there's a pattern forming with the 2's.\n- (6,7): \"2\"\n- (6,8): \"2\"\n- (8,6): \"2\"\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll look for an area where I can make a definitive move.\n\nChecking (4,2), there's a \"1\", meaning one bomb adjacent. The only unexplored adjacent position is (5,2). This means (5,2) is definitely a bomb.\n\nActually, I notice that (4,2) is already a \"1\", but I don't see any bombs adjacent to it yet. Let me check its neighbors:\n- Above (3,2): Revealed empty\n- Right (4,3): Revealed empty\n- Below (5,2): Unexplored\n- Left (4,1): Revealed \"1\"\n- Diagonals: Mix of revealed and unexplored\nBased on this, (5,2) must be a bomb.\n\nLet me double-check this:\n- (4,2) has a \"1\", which means there's a bomb in one of its neighbors.\n- Looking at its neighbors, most are revealed and safe, except for (5,2).\n- Therefore, (5,2) must be a bomb.\n\nThis is a definitive move. I should place a flag at (5,2).\n\nEXPLANATION: Position (5,2) is adjacent to a revealed \"1\" at (4,2). All other adjacent positions to (4,2) are already revealed as safe, so (5,2) must be a bomb.\nMOVE: 5,2,true\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the board carefully, I need to identify safe moves or definite bomb locations.\n\nI notice that in position (4,2), there's a \"1\" indicating one bomb in its adjacent tiles.

I'll use logic and probabilities to identify safe squares to reveal or positions where bombs are definitely located.\n\nFirst, let's inspect the board and work through sections where I have sufficient information:\n\n1. **Top Left Section (Around 0,0 and 1,0)**:\n   - Square (0,0) is unrevealed\n   - Square (1,0) is unrevealed\n   - They're adjacent to a 1 at (0,1), which indicates one bomb in the surrounding area\n   - Since there are only two unrevealed squares touching that 1, one of them must contain a bomb\n\n2. **Middle Left Section (Around 5,2)**:\n   - There's a flagged square at (5,2)\n   - It satisfies the 1's around it (4,1), (4,2), (6,2)\n\n3. **Middle Right Section (Around 2,7)**:\n   - There's a flagged square at (2,7)\n   - It satisfies the 2 at (2,6) and 1 at (2,8)\n\n4. **Bottom Section (Rows 6-9)**:\n   - Row 6 has a 2 at (6,2) which is satisfied by the flag at (5,2)\n   - Row 6 also has numbers 1, 2, 2, 1 on the right side that are not fully satisfied yet\n   - Rows 7-9 have several unexplored areas\n\nLet me check for some definite safe moves or necessary flags:\n\nLooking at position (1,5) where a flag is placed:\n- It's adjacent to numbers: 1 at (1,4), 2 at (1,6), 1 at (0,5)\n- This looks consistent with the numbers\n\nLooking at position (2,7) where another flag is placed:\n- It's adjacent to numbers: 2 at (2,6), 1 at (2,8)\n- This also looks consistent\n\nNow, let's look for situations where I can deduce a safe move:\n\n1. In the top-left area:\n   - The 1 at (0,1) should have exactly one bomb adjacent to it\n   - The unrevealed squares around it are (0,0) and (1,0)\n   - One of these must contain a bomb, but I can't tell which one yet\n\n2. At the top-right:\n   - There's a 1 at (0,6) with unexplored squares at (0,7), (0,8), (0,9)\n   - There's also a 1 at (1,7) which is adjacent to some of the same unexplored squares\n   - And a 1 at (1,8) which also shares adjacent unexplored squares\n   - Based on the pattern of 1's, I need to be careful here\n\n3. Middle section (rows 3-5):\n   - There are several unexplored areas that don't provide clear information yet\n\nLet me analyze the right side of the board more carefully:\n\nLooking at positions (6,7) and (6,8), they both contain 2s.\n- Position (6,7) is adjacent to unexplored squares at (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,9), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)\n- Position (6,8) is adjacent to unexplored squares at (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n- They both indicate 2 bombs in their adjacent squares\n\nLet me also check the bottom right corner:\n- Position (8,6) has a 2, indicating 2 bombs in adjacent squares\n- The unexplored adjacent squares are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n- Eight adjacent squares with 2 bombs among them\n\nI need to find a position where I can make a definite safe move. Let me continue analyzing:\n\nAt position (4,0) and (4,1), there are 1's, which means there is exactly one bomb adjacent to each.\n- For (4,0), the adjacent unexplored squares are (3,0), (5,0)\n- For (4,1), the adjacent unexplored squares are (5,0), (5,1)\n- Since (4,1) already has the flagged square at (5,2) as its only adjacent bomb, (5,0) and (5,1) should be safe.\n\nWait, let me double-check this. Actually, the flag at (5,2) is not adjacent to (4,1). So that logic doesn't apply.\n\nLet me take a different approach. Let's see if I can find squares where the constraints from multiple revealed numbers can help identify safe moves:\n\nAt the top left corner:\n- (0,1) is a 1, and it's adjacent to unrevealed squares (0,0) and (1,0)\n- One of these two must contain a bomb\n\nAt position (1,1), there's a 1:\n- Its adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n- (0,1) is already a 1, (1,2) is a 1\n- So the bomb must be at either (0,0), (1,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1), or (2,2)\n- Combined with the constraint from (0,1), the bomb is likely at (0,0) or (1,0)\n\nThe 1 at (1,2) has adjacent squares:\n- (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n- (0,1) is a 1, (1,1) is a 1, (1,3) is a 1\n- So the bomb must be at either (0,2), (0,3), (2,1), (2,2), or (2,3)\n\nHmm, I'm not finding a clear safe move yet. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet's look at position (4,3):\n- It's adjacent to 1 at (4,2)\n- It's adjacent to 1 at (6,3)\n- From other revealed numbers, there doesn't seem to be any constraint saying a bomb must be here\n- This might be a safe move\n\nActually, let's look at the 3 flags we've already placed and the total bomb count:\n- There are 10 bombs total\n- 3 have been flagged (at (1,5), (2,7), and (5,2))\n- So there are 7 bombs remaining to be found (matching the \"Flags remaining: 7\" info)\n\nLet me try position (5,0):\n- It's adjacent to 1 at (4,0)\n- For the 1 at (4,0), its adjacent squares are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1)\n- (4,1) is a 1, meaning it has one adjacent bomb\n- The bomb for (4,0) could be at (3,0) or (5,0)\n- I don't have enough information to determine which one is safe\n\nLet me try to find a position where constraints allow me to make a definite safe move.\n\nPosition (2,0):\n- It's adjacent to the 1 at (1,1)\n- For the 1 at (1,1), adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n- (0,1) is a 1, (1,2) is a 1\n- If either (0,0) or (1,0) has a bomb (which seems likely from earlier analysis), then (2,0) should be safe\n\nActually, let me try to be more systematic by focusing on the edges of the revealed area where I might find safe moves.\n\nLet's look at (3,2):\n- It's adjacent to nothing with a number\n- It seems like a reasonable move to try if I can't find anything more concrete\n\nLet me look at position (4,3):\n- It's adjacent to 1 at (4,2), 0 at (3,3), and 1 at (6,3)\n- The 1 at (4,2) is satisfied by known bombs\n- The 1 at (6,3) could have its bomb at (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (7,3), or (7,4)\n- There's no constraint forcing a bomb at (4,3)\n- This seems like a safe move\n\nOkay, based on my analysis, I believe (4,3) is a safe move.

I'll go through the board methodically to find safe moves or places to put flags.\n\nFirst, let me check the current situation:\n- Board size: 10x10\n- Flags remaining: 6\n- Total bombs: 10\n- Flags already placed: 4 (at positions (1,5), (2,7), (5,2), and (6,4))\n\nSo, I've used 4 flags out of 10 bombs, meaning there are 6 bombs remaining to be found, which matches the 6 flags remaining.\n\nLet's scan the board and look for revealed numbers that can give us clues:\n\nAt position (0,1), there's a \"1\", and its unexplored adjacents are (0,0) and (0,2). Since we need exactly one bomb, one of these must be a bomb.\n\nAt position (1,6), there's a \"2\", and it has a flag at (1,5) and its other adjacent unexplored is (0,5). This suggests (0,5) might have a bomb.\n\nAt position (6,6), there's a \"1\", and it has unexplored adjacents at (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), and (7,5). One of these must have a bomb.\n\nAt position (6,2), there's a \"2\", and its unexplored adjacents include (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), and (6,1). Since (5,2) is already flagged, there must be one more bomb in the adjacents.\n\nLet's analyze more numbers to find safe moves:\n\nLooking at position (1,1), there's a \"1\", and it has unexplored adjacents at (0,0), (0,1), and (0,2). We already know from the \"1\" at (0,1) that one of (0,0) or (0,2) must have a bomb, which means the other must be safe.\n\nActually, wait, let me re-check that. The \"1\" at (0,1) has already-revealed adjacents, so its unexplored adjacents are (0,0) and (0,2). The \"1\" at (1,1) has unexplored adjacents at (0,0) and (0,2) as well (plus already-revealed adjacents). This suggests one of (0,0) or (0,2) must have a bomb, but we're not sure which one.\n\nLet's continue checking other parts of the board:\n\nPosition (2,6) has a \"2\", with a flag at (2,7) and unexplored adjacents at (1,7) and (1,8). One of these must be a bomb.\n\nWait, that's not correct. The \"2\" at (2,6) has adjacents all revealed or flagged: (1,5) flagged, (1,6) revealed as \"2\", (1,7) revealed as \"1\", (2,5) revealed as \"1\", (2,7) flagged, (3,5) revealed empty, (3,6) revealed as \"1\", and (3,7) revealed as \"1\". All adjacents are accounted for, and there are indeed 2 flags (at (1,5) and (2,7)), so this is consistent.\n\nLet's check another area:\n\nAt position (6,3), there's a \"1\", and it has a flag at (6,4). All other adjacents are revealed, so this is consistent.\n\nAt position (6,7), there's a \"2\", and it has unexplored adjacents at (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), and (7,8). Two of these must have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, at position (6,8), there's a \"2\", and it has unexplored adjacents. Two of these must have bombs.\n\nAt position (7,6), there's a \"1\", and it has unexplored adjacents at (6,5), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), and (8,7). One of these must have a bomb.\n\nAt position (8,6), there's a \"2\", and it has unexplored adjacents at (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), and (9,7). Two of these must have bombs.\n\nLet me check if there are any numbers with all their bombs accounted for, which would make the other adjacents safe to reveal:\n\nLooking at position (4,2), there's a \"1\", and it has an unexplored adjacent at (5,3). This might be a bomb.\n\nActually, no, the \"1\" at (4,2) has unexplored adjacents at (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3). Since we have a flag at (5,2), the others should be safe.\n\nSo, (5,1) and (5,3) are likely safe to reveal. Let's choose (5,1) as our move.\n\nActually wait, let me see if there are any other safe moves or definite flags I can identify first.\n\nLooking at position (6,7), there's a \"2\". It has a flag at (6,8) - wait, actually there's no flag at (6,8). I was mistaken. Let me recheck the adjacents of (6,7): unexplored adjacents at (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), and (7,8). Two of these must have bombs.\n\nLet me double-check the flagged positions again:\n- (1,5)\n- (2,7)\n- (5,2)\n- (6,4)\n\nAt position (4,0), there's a \"1\", and its unexplored adjacents are (5,0) and (5,1). One of these must have a bomb.\n\nLet me check if there are any numbers that have the correct number of adjacent flags and thus would have all other adjacents safe:\n\nPosition (1,6) has \"2\", with a flag at (1,5). Other unexplored adjacents include (0,5), (0,6), and (0,7). One of these must have a bomb, but we don't know which one.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's check if there are any safe positions we can deduce:\n\nPosition (4,2) has \"1\", with a flag at (5,2). Other unexplored adjacents include (5,1) and (5,3). Since we've accounted for the one bomb, (5,1) and (5,3) should be safe.\n\nSo, let's go with (5,3) as our move, as it appears to be safe.\n\nActually, let me recheck position (4,2) because it seems like it's at the bottom edge of the revealed area.\n\nFrom the board state, position (4,2) has \"1\", but its adjacents aren't all visible. Let me carefully trace its adjacents: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). Among these, (5,2) is flagged. If there's only one bomb adjacent to (4,2), and (5,2) is already flagged, then (5,1) and (5,3) should be safe.\n\nI'll choose (5,3) as my move.\n\nWait, let me check one more thing. If we're considering position (4,2), its coordinates seem off to me based on the board. Let me re-read the board with the coordinate system clarified:\n\nThe board uses a coordinate system where:\n- x represents the ROW number (vertical position, starting from 0 at the top)\n- y represents the COLUMN number (horizontal position, starting from 0 at the left)\n\nSo, position (4,2) means row 4 (from the top), column 2 (from the left). \n\nFrom the board:\n```\n4 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . F _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n```\nAt row 4, column 2, there's indeed a \"1\". Its adjacents are: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). Among these, (5,2) has a flag, and (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3) are all revealed (or out of bounds). This means (5,1) and (5,3) should be safe if the (5,2) flag is correct.\n\nBut wait. In the minesweeper board, the 2-D coordinates are sometimes (row, column) and sometimes (column, row). Let me double-check how the board is presented.\n\nWait, I see from the game board that above the first row it has:\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\nAnd to the side it has:\n```\n0 _ 1 . . . . 1 _ _ _\n1 _ 1 1 1 1 F 2 1 1 _\n```\nSo it seems the coordinate system the problem is using is (row, column), and looking at the board:\n```\n4 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . F _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n```\nAt row 4, column 2, there's indeed a \"1\", and its adjacents are: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). Among these, (5,2) has a flag.\n\nLet's check if all the other adjacents are already revealed or not. Looking at the board, it seems (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), and (4,3) should also be considered. If any of them are not revealed or out of bounds, they could also have bombs.\n\nFrom the board, it seems (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3) are not revealed. So, we can't immediately deduce that (5,1) and (5,3) are safe.\n\nLet me take a different approach. Let's check if there are any numbers where we've already found all the bombs or where we can immediately deduce the location of a bomb.\n\nAt position (0,1), there's a \"1\" and its unexplored adjacents are (0,0) and (0,2). One of these must have a bomb.\n\nAt position (1,1), there's a \"1\" and its unexplored adjacents are also (0,0) and (0,2). This reinforces that one of (0,0) or (0,2) must have a bomb.\n\nLooking at the intersection of clues from (0,1) and (1,1), we still can't determine whether (0,0) or (0,2) has the bomb.\n\nLet's check another area.\n\nOh, looking at position (5,0), (5,1), and (4,0), there's a revealed \"1\" at (4,0). Its adjacents are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), and (5,1). Among these, (4,1) is revealed as \"1\" and (3,0) and (3,1) are not visible on the board (they're above the visible area), so they're either revealed or out of bounds. This means one of (5,0) or (5,1) must have a bomb.\n\nAt position (5,2), there's a flag, and its adjacent numbers are (4,1) with a \"1\" and (4,2) with a \"1\". This seems consistent with the flag.\n\nLooking at position (4,2) with a \"1\", its adjacents include (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3). Among these, (5,2) has a flag, (4,1) is revealed as \"1\", (3,2) and (3,3) are not visible on the board. This means there are no more bombs adjacent to (4,2) if the flag at (5,2) is correct. Therefore, (5,1) and (5,3) should be safe.\n\nI'll choose to reveal (5,3) as it appears to be safe.\n\nActually wait, let me check one more time. The coordinates in the game are (row, column) and the board starts at the top left with (0, 0).\n\nLooking at the board, at position (4, 2) (row 4, column 2), there's a \"1\". Let's carefully trace its adjacent cells:\n- (3, 1): Not visible on the board, likely revealed or out of bounds.\n- (3, 2): Not visible on the board, likely revealed or out of bounds.\n- (3, 3): Not visible on the board, likely revealed or out of bounds.\n- (4, 1): Revealed as \"1\".\n- (4, 3): Revealed as empty.\n- (5, 1): Unexplored.\n- (5, 2): Flagged.\n- (5, 3): Unexplored.\n\nActually, looking more closely at the board, I see:\n```\n4 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n```\nI see that row 4 has a \"1\" at columns 0, 1, and 2, followed by an empty space at column 3.\n\nAnd if we consider the adjacents of (4, 2) as listed, we see that (4, 3) is an empty revealed space, which is consistent with the board.\n\nGiven that the bomb at (5, 2) is correctly flagged, and there's only one bomb adjacent to (4, 2), it means that (5, 1) and (5, 3) are safe to reveal.\n\nSo, I'll choose to reveal (5, 3) as my move.\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLet me carefully analyze this board to find safe moves or obvious flags.\n\nFirst, I'll check revealed numbers against existing flags:\n\nLooking at position (4,2) - it shows a \"1\" and its adjacent cells are:\n- The cells above: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) - not visible on board but presumably safe\n- Same row: (4,1) is a \"1\", (4,3) is empty\n- Below: (5,1) unexplored, (5,2) flagged, (5,3) unexplored\n\nSince there's a \"1\" at (4,2) and we already have a flag at (5,2), all other adjacent cells must be safe. This means (5,1) and (5,3) are both safe to reveal.\n\nI'll choose to reveal (5,3) as it's guaranteed to be safe based on the \"1\" at (4,2).\n\nEXPLANATION: The \"1\" at (4,2) indicates exactly one adjacent bomb. Since we already have a flag at (5,2), the cells at (5,1) and (5,3) must be safe to reveal.\nMOVE: 5,3,false", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . . . 1 _ _ _\n1 _ 1 1 1 1 F 2 1 1 _\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 F 1 _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n4 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 . .

Let's start with the top part of the board:\n   - At (0,1), there's a \"1\" - this means there's 1 bomb in the adjacent tiles. Most adjacent tiles are unexplored, so this is fine.\n   - At (0,6), there's a \"1\" - this means there's 1 bomb in the adjacent tiles. Most adjacent tiles are unexplored, so this is fine.\n   - At (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), there are \"1\"s - these mean there's 1 bomb in adjacent tiles. All these numbers are likely referring to the flag at (1,5).\n   - At (1,6), there's a \"2\" - this means there are 2 bombs in adjacent tiles. One is likely the flag at (1,5), and another would be in an unexplored adjacent tile.\n   - At (1,7) and (1,8), there are \"1\"s - these mean there's 1 bomb in adjacent tiles. For (1,7), it's likely referring to the flag at (2,7).\n\n2. Moving to the middle part:\n   - At (2,4) and (2,5), there are \"1\"s - these mean there's 1 bomb in adjacent tiles. For (2,4), it could be referring to an unexplored adjacent tile.\n   - At (2,6), there's a \"2\" - this means there are 2 bombs in adjacent tiles. One is likely the flag at (2,7), and another could be in an unexplored adjacent tile.\n   - At (2,8), there's a \"1\" - this means there's 1 bomb in adjacent tiles. It's likely referring to the flag at (2,7).\n   - At (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), there are \"1\"s - these mean there's 1 bomb in adjacent tiles. For (3,7), it's likely referring to the flag at (2,7).\n\n3. The left side of the board:\n   - At (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), there are \"1\"s - these mean there's 1 bomb in adjacent tiles. They might be referring to the flag at (5,2).\n   - At (6,2), there's a \"2\" - this means there are 2 bombs in adjacent tiles. One is likely the flag at (5,2), and another could be at (6,1) or another unexplored adjacent tile.\n   - At (6,3), there's a \"1\" - this means there's 1 bomb in adjacent tiles. It could be referring to the flag at (6,4).\n\n4. The right side of the board:\n   - At (6,6), there's a \"1\" - this means there's 1 bomb in adjacent tiles. \n   - At (6,7) and (6,8), there are \"2\"s - these mean there are 2 bombs in adjacent tiles.\n   - At (6,9), there's a \"1\" - this means there's 1 bomb in adjacent tiles.\n   - At (7,3) and (7,6), there are \"1\"s - these mean there's 1 bomb in adjacent tiles.\n   - At (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), there are \"1\"s - these mean there's 1 bomb in adjacent tiles.\n   - At (8,6), there's a \"2\" - this means there are 2 bombs in adjacent tiles.\n\nNow, let's look for any obvious moves:\n\n1. Around the flag at (1,5):\n   - The \"1\"s at (1,4) and (2,4) are already satisfied by this flag.\n   - The \"2\" at (1,6) suggests there's another bomb adjacent to it, which could be at (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (2,5), or (2,6). Let's hold off on placing a flag here for now.\n\n2. Around the flag at (2,7):\n   - The \"1\"s at (1,7), (2,8), and (3,7) are already satisfied by this flag.\n   - The \"2\" at (2,6) suggests there's another bomb adjacent to it, which could be at (1,6), (3,6), or (3,5). Let's hold off for now.\n\n3. Around the flag at (5,2):\n   - The \"1\"s at (4,1) and (4,2) are already satisfied by this flag.\n   - The \"2\" at (6,2) suggests there's another bomb adjacent to it, which could be at (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), or (7,1). Let's hold off for now.\n\n4. Around the flag at (6,4):\n   - The \"1\" at (6,3) is satisfied by this flag.\n   - The tile at (7,4) is still unexplored, so no conflicts there.\n\nLet me check for any safe moves or obvious flag placements:\n\n1. Around (1,6):\n   - It's a \"2\" with adjacent flag at (1,5). We need one more flag.\n   - The adjacent unexplored tiles are at (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (2,5), and (2,6).\n   - The \"1\" at (0,6) suggests there's one bomb adjacent to it, which could be at (0,5), (0,7), (1,7).\n   - The \"1\" at (2,5) suggests there's one bomb adjacent to it, which could be at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), or (3,6). The flag at (1,5) already satisfies this.\n   - So, the bomb adjacent to (1,6) could be at (0,5), (0,7), or (2,6).\n\n2. Around (2,6):\n   - It's a \"2\" with adjacent flag at (2,7). We need one more flag.\n   - The adjacent unexplored tiles are at (1,6), (3,5), and (3,6).\n   - The \"2\" at (1,6) suggests there are two bombs adjacent to it, one of which is at (1,5). The other could be at (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (2,5), or (2,6).\n   \n3. Let's look at (0,6):\n   - It's a \"1\" and the adjacent unexplored tiles are at (0,5), (0,7), (1,7).\n   - The \"1\" at (1,7) is already satisfied by the flag at (2,7).\n   - So, the bomb adjacent to (0,6) could be at (0,5) or (0,7).\n\n4. Let's look at (6,2):\n   - It's a \"2\" with adjacent flag at (5,2). We need one more flag.\n   - The adjacent unexplored tiles are at (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), and (7,3).\n   - The \"1\" at (7,3) suggests there's one bomb adjacent to it, which could be at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), or (8,4). The flag at (6,4) already satisfies this.\n   - So, the bomb adjacent to (6,2) could be at (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (7,1), or (7,2).\n\nActually, let's take a closer look at the \"1\" at (6,6):\n- The adjacent unexplored tiles are at (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (7,5), and (7,7).\n- Let's see if we can determine a safe tile to reveal here.\n\nLet's also look at the \"2\"s at (6,7) and (6,8):\n- For (6,7), the adjacent unexplored tiles are at (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (7,7), and (7,8).\n- For (6,8), the adjacent unexplored tiles are at (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), and (7,9).\n- There's a \"1\" at (6,9), which suggests there's one bomb adjacent to it. This could be at (5,8), (5,9), (7,8), or (7,9).\n\nThere's a critical insight I'm missing here. Let me think...\n\nLet's look at the \"1\" at (7,6):\n- It has adjacent unexplored tiles at (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), and (9,7).\n\nI think I need to be more systematic. Let's check for any definite safe tiles based on the numbers and current flags:\n\nFor (4,0), (4,1), and (4,2):\n- These are all \"1\"s, and the flag at (5,2) satisfies them.\n- This means (5,0) and (5,1) are safe to reveal.\n\nLet's double-check:\n- (4,0) is adjacent to (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), and (5,1). It's a \"1\", so there's one bomb among these. (3,0), (3,1), and (4,1) are revealed and have no bombs, so the bomb is either at (5,0) or (5,1).\n- (4,1) is adjacent to (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), and (5,2). It's a \"1\", so there's one bomb among these. (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), and (4,2) are revealed and have no bombs, and (5,2) is flagged. This means (5,0) and (5,1) are safe.\n\nSo (5,0) and (5,1) are safe to reveal. Let's choose (5,0).\n\nActually, wait. Let me double-check again:\n- (4,0) has adjacent tiles (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), and (5,1). Only (4,1) is revealed, and (3,0), (3,1), (5,0), and (5,1) are unexplored.\n- If (4,0) indicates \"1\", there's a bomb among (3,0), (3,1), (5,0), (5,1).\n- But I can't determine which one with certainty.\n\nLet me check if there's a more definite safe move elsewhere.\n\nActually, I saw that earlier but didn't note it: if the flag at (5,2) satisfies the \"1\"s at (4,1) and (4,2), then (5,0) and (5,1) are likely safe. Let's double-check:\n- (4,1) is adjacent to (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), and (5,2). It's a \"1\", and there's a flag at (5,2).\n- (4,2) is adjacent to (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3). It's a \"1\", and there's a flag at (5,2).\n\nThis means that all other adjacent tiles to (4,1) and (4,2) are safe, including (5,0), (5,1), and (5,3). Let's choose (5,0) as our move.\n\nMOVE: 5,0,false\n</think>\nI'll analyze this Minesweeper board carefully to find a safe move.\n\nLooking at the left side of the board:\n- The revealed \"1\" at (4,0) indicates there's exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells\n- The revealed \"1\" at (4,1) indicates there's exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells\n- The revealed \"1\" at (4,2) indicates there's exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells\n- There is already a flag at (5,2)\n\nSince these three \"1\" cells share many of the same adjacent unexplored cells, and there can only be one bomb total among their adjacent cells, the flag at (5,2) must be accounting for all three of these \"1\" indicators.\n\nThis means the other unexplored cells adjacent to these \"1\" cells must be safe. Specifically, (5,0) and (5,1) must be safe to reveal.\n\nEXPLANATION: The \"1\"s at positions (4,0), (4,1), and (4,2) can only have one bomb among their adjacent cells.
