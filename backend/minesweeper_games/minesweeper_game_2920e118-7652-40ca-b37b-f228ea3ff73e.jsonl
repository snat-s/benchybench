{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "To analyze the current board state and make an informed move, we can start by examining the revealed numbers (1-2) and compare them with the existing flags and potential adjacent bombs.\n\n1. **Review the numbers**:\n   - We see several numbers indicating how many bombs are adjacent:\n     - Row 1: All 1's, which implies there are adjacent bombs that match these counts.\n     - Row 2 (column 5 shows a '2'): To satisfy this, there can be 2 bombs, and currently, there are no flags adjacent to it.\n     - Row 4 (column 7 shows a '2'): This tile also must have 2 bombs.\n     - Row 5 (column 8 shows a '2'): Similarly, 2 bombs are needed.\n  \n2. **Existing flags**: \n   - At this point, we haven\u2019t placed any flags.\n\n3. **Potential nearby bombs**: \n   - At least 3 potential bombs need to be accounted for surrounding the '2's.\n\n4. **Immediate Decisions**:\n   - Analyzing rows 1 and 2, we note that the '2' at (2,5) can potentially have bombs in positions:\n     - (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n   - Similarly, for (4,7) and (5,8), we can check adjacent spaces too. \n\n5. **Next Move**:\n   - A great revealing candidate is (2,4) since it is not adjacent to any number 1s with flags that would potentially conflict if it were a bomb. \n   - Revealing (2,4) will either lead to more clear information or confirm a bomb presence directly. \n\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal (2,4) to gather more information about potential bomb placements, as it does not conflict directly with the revealed numbers, and there is no adjacent flag hindering it.\n\nMOVE: 2,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ _\n2 . . . . . 2 1 1 _ _\n3 . . . . . . . 1 _ _\n4 . . . . . . . 2 1 _\n5 . . . . . . . . 2 1\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
