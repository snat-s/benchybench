{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "For the first move in Minesweeper, it's generally best to start with a corner or edge position to minimize the number of adjacent tiles. The corner positions are particularly good starting points because they only have 3 adjacent tiles instead of 8, which gives the best probability of avoiding a bomb.\n\nFor this specific board:\n- Total bombs: 10 out of 100 squares (10% density)\n- A corner position has only 3 adjacent squares, meaning there's roughly a 70% chance it's safe\n- This is much better than a center position which has 8 adjacent squares\n\nEXPLANATION: I recommend starting with the top-left corner (0,0) as it minimizes risk and provides a good starting point for subsequent moves. If it reveals a number, we'll have information about only 3 adjacent squares.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Most critically, I notice in row 0 and 1, there's a \"1\" and \"2\" pattern that strongly suggests a bomb must be at (0,4), because:\n   - The \"2\" at (1,5) must have two adjacent bombs\n   - One bomb is likely at (0,4) to satisfy both the \"1\" at (0,5) and contribute to the \"2\" at (1,5)\n   - This is further supported by the pattern of \"1\"s leading up to this area\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the pattern in rows 0 and 1, and the number \"2\" at position (1,5) which must have exactly two adjacent bombs, we can safely conclude there must be a bomb at (0,4).

Looking at the unseen tiles around it, position (2,5) is the only candidate that doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nEXPLANATION: The \"2\" at (3,4) requires another bomb besides the flag we can see.

This deduction is further supported by the pattern of '1's on the left side of this position, which would be consistent with a bomb at (3,3).\n\nEXPLANATION: Position (3,3) must be a bomb because the '2' at (3,4) already has one confirmed flag at (2,5), and (3,3) is the only remaining possible location for the second bomb adjacent to this '2'.
