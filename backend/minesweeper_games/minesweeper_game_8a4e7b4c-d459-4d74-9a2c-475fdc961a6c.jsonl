A '2' can have zero, one or two adjacent flags (bombs). The 2 at (0,0) means there are two bombs next to it. Similarly, the 2 at (1,1) means there are two bombs next to it.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 2, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "EXPLANATION: The (0,3) tile has a value of 1. Currently, there are no flags around it, so a bomb could exist at (1,3) or (0,2) or (0,4) or (1,2) or (1,4). The (1,3) tile has a value of 1. Currently, there are no flags around it, so a bomb could exist at (0,3) or (1,2) or (1,4) or (2,2) or (2,3) or (2,4). Since the (1,3) and (0,3) tiles both have a value of 1, it implies there's a bomb at (0,2) or (0,4). Since the (0,2) tile has a value of 1, it implies that there is a bomb at either (0,1) or (1,1) or (1,2). Tile (0,1) has a value of 1, so it implies that there is a bomb at either (1,0) or (1,1). Tile (1,1) has a value of 2 and there are no flags. Tile (0,0) has a value of 2 and there are no flags. Since (0,0) and (1,1) are next to each other and we can't place multiple bombs, we should analyze. Since the (0,0) tile has a value of 2 and no flags, we can see that (0,0) must have two bombs adjacent to it. (0,0) is next to (0,1) (1,0) and (1,1). Since the (0,1) and (1,0) tiles are next to a 1, this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a bomb at (0,2), since the (0,1) tile has a value of 1, and the (0,0) tile has a value of 2, and the (1,1) has a value of 2 and the (1,0) tile is not revealed.\n\nMOVE: 0,2,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 2 . 1 _ _ _ 2 . . .\n1 . 2 1 _ _ 1 3 . . .\n2 . . 1 1 1 1 . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
