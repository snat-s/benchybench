This suggests that there is a bomb nearby. Additionally, the '2' at position (4,4) with a '1' adjacent to it implies that there is another bomb in the vicinity. However, we should prioritize the most constrained areas first.\n\nLooking at the top-left '1's at positions (0,3) and (1,3), we can deduce that the bomb is likely to be at position (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), or (1,4). However, since the '3' at position (2,3) already has two adjacent '1's, it's more likely that the bomb is at position (0,2) or (1,2).\n\nConsidering the remaining number of flags (10) and bombs (10), we should be cautious not to over-flag.

Looking at the '3' at position (2,3), it seems that there might be another bomb in the vicinity.
