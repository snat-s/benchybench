Let me analyze what to do for my first move.\n\nIn standard Minesweeper strategy, the first move is typically to reveal a tile, not place a flag. Since we don't have any information yet, we want to start gathering information by revealing a tile.\n\nA common strategy for the first move in Minesweeper is to click somewhere in the middle of the board. This is because:\n1. The middle of the board has more adjacent tiles, which gives us more information\n2. In some implementations, the first click is guaranteed to be safe\n\nFor a 10x10 board, the middle would be around coordinates (4,4) or (5,5). Let's go with (4,4) for the first move.\n\nSo my move will be to reveal tile (4,4):\n\nEXPLANATION: Starting with a move in the middle of the board to maximize information gained\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n</think>\n# Minesweeper First Move Strategy\n\nLooking at a completely unexplored 10x10 board with 10 bombs, I need to make my first move strategically.\n\nIn Minesweeper, the first move should always be to reveal a tile rather than placing a flag, as we need to gather initial information.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 1, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nLet's analyze the current Minesweeper board carefully to determine my next safe move.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board and identify any obvious safe moves or squares where bombs must be placed.\n\nThe board is 10x10 with 10 bombs total, and 10 flags remaining. This means none of the bombs have been flagged yet.\n\nI'll go through the revealed numbers and see if I can make any definitive conclusions:\n\nStarting at the top left:\n\nRow 0: There's a '1' at (0,4), meaning there's exactly one bomb in the 8 adjacent squares. Some of these squares are already revealed, so we need to be careful.\n\nRow 1: There's a '3' at (1,2), a '1' at (1,3), and another '1' at (1,4). The '3' means there are 3 bombs adjacent.\n\nRow 2: There's a '2' at (2,2), a '1' at (2,4), a '1' at (2,5), a '2' at (2,6), and a '1' at (2,7), and another '1' at (2,8).\n\nRow 3: Has '1's at (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), and (3,8).\n\nRow 4: Has a '1' at (4,3), a '2' at (4,4), a '2' at (4,5), and a '2' at (4,8).\n\nRow 5: Has a '1' at (5,3), a '1' at (5,5), and a '1' at (5,8).\n\nRow 6: Has '1's at (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), and (6,8).\n\nRow 7: Has '1's at (7,0) and (7,1).\n\nRow 8: Has a '2' at (8,1).\n\nRow 9: Has a '2' at (9,1).\n\nLet me look at specific areas where I might be able to make safe moves or identify bombs definitively:\n\nLooking at the '3' at (1,2):\n- It has adjacent squares at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3).\n- Some of these are already revealed: (1,3) shows a '1', (2,2) shows a '2', and (2,3) is empty.\n- That means the 3 bombs must be among: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), and (2,1).\n- That's 5 unknown squares for 3 bombs, so we can't determine exactly where they are yet.\n\nLooking at the '2' at (2,2):\n- Its adjacent squares are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3).\n- Already revealed: (1,2) shows a '3', (1,3) shows a '1', (2,3) is empty, (3,1) shows a '1', (3,2) shows a '1', and (3,3) is empty.\n- The 2 bombs must be among: (1,1) and (2,1).\n- Since there are exactly 2 unknown squares and it needs 2 bombs, both (1,1) and (2,1) must be bombs!\n\nThis is our first definitive conclusion. We can flag (1,1) and (2,1) as bombs.\n\nLet's continue our analysis focusing on the bottom part:\n\nLooking at the '2' at (8,1):\n- Its adjacent squares are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), and (9,2).\n- Already revealed: (7,0) shows a '1', (7,1) shows a '1', (8,0) is unexplored, (9,0) is unexplored, and (9,1) shows a '2'.\n- So the 2 bombs must be among: (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), and (9,2).\n- That's 5 unknown squares for 2 bombs, so we can't determine exactly where they are yet.\n\nLooking at the '2' at (9,1):\n- Its adjacent squares are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), and (9,2).\n- Already revealed: (8,1) shows a '2'.\n- So the 2 bombs must be among: (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), and (9,2).\n- That's 4 unknown squares for 2 bombs, so we can't determine exactly where they are yet.\n\nLet me check other areas:\n\nLooking at the top right area around (2,8), which shows a '1':\n- Its adjacent squares are (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), and (3,9).\n- Already revealed: (2,7) shows a '1', (3,7) is empty, (3,8) shows a '1'.\n- So the 1 bomb must be among: (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), and (3,9).\n- That's 5 unknown squares for 1 bomb, so we can't determine exactly where it is yet.\n\nLet's go back to what we know for sure. We know that (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs. Let's see if that helps us make other determinations:\n\nNow that we know (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs, the '3' at (1,2) still needs one more bomb among (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3).\n\nThe '1' at (3,1) is satisfied by the bomb at (2,1). So all other adjacent squares to (3,1) should be safe: (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), and (4,2).\n\nAmong these, (3,0) is already revealed as a '1' and is satisfied by the bomb at (2,1). So (2,0) must be safe.\n\n(4,0) and (4,1) are adjacent to (3,0) and (3,1), both of which show '1' and are satisfied by the bomb at (2,1). So (4,0) and (4,1) must be safe.\n\nActually, let me reconsider more carefully. Since we know that (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs, let's see what other information this gives us:\n\n- The '3' at (1,2) needs one more bomb among (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3).\n- The '1' at (3,0) is satisfied by the bomb at (2,1). So (4,0) must be safe.\n- The '1' at (3,1) is satisfied by the bomb at (2,1). So (2,0), (4,1), and (4,2) must be safe.\n\nBut wait, I need to be careful about (2,0). It's also adjacent to (1,1), which is a bomb. So I can't immediately conclude that (2,0) is safe.\n\nLet's look more closely at (2,0):\n- It's adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (3,0), (3,1).\n- (1,1) is a bomb, (3,0) shows a '1', (3,1) shows a '1'.\n- The '1's at (3,0) and (3,1) are already satisfied by the bomb at (2,1).\n- So (2,0) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0) should be safe because the bomb needed for the '1' at (1,1) is already accounted for.\n\nSo we can safely reveal (1,0), (2,0), (4,0), (4,1), and (4,2).\n\nLet me double-check (1,0):\n- It's adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), and (2,1).\n- (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs.\n- So if (1,0) is adjacent to two bombs, revealing it should show a '2'.\n\nActually, I'm not sure if (1,0) is definitely safe. It's adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), and (2,1), and we already know (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs. But we don't know whether (0,0) or (0,1) contain bombs.\n\nLet me reconsider the safest moves. I know that (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs. I also know that (4,0) and (4,1) are safe because they're adjacent to (3,0) and (3,1), which both show '1' and that '1' is already accounted for by the bomb at (2,1).\n\nActually, I'm not entirely convinced about (4,0) and (4,1) either, since they could be adjacent to other numbered cells that we haven't fully analyzed. Let me take a more systematic approach.\n\nActually, I can be more systematic. From our established knowledge that (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs, let's check what other squares can be safely revealed:\n\n- The '1' at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5). We don't know where the bomb is yet.\n- The '3' at (1,2) means 3 bombs among (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). We already know (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs, so there's 1 more bomb among (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3).\n  \nGiven that we know (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs, I don't see any squares that are definitively safe based on the information we have so far. But I can flag these two squares as bombs, which might give us more information.\n\nActually, let's check one more area. The '1' at (7,0) is adjacent to (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), and (8,1). We know (7,1) shows a '1' and (8,1) shows a '2'. If there's only one bomb adjacent to (7,0), and there are 2 bombs adjacent to (8,1), then (8,0) must be one of the bombs adjacent to (8,1).\n\nSo we can flag (8,0) as a bomb.\n\nThat means the '1' at (7,0) is satisfied by the bomb at (8,0), so (6,0) and (6,1) are safe.\n\nGiven these conclusions, my next move could be:\n1. Flag (1,1) as a bomb\n2. Flag (2,1) as a bomb\n3. Flag (8,0) as a bomb\n4. Reveal (6,0) as safe\n5. Reveal (6,1) as safe\n\nLet me prioritize one of these moves. Since flagging is a safer operation in Minesweeper, I'll start by flagging (1,1) as a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 1,1,true (flag the square at row 1, column 1 as a bomb)\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the board, I need to identify certain patterns that will tell me where bombs are located.\n\nFirst, let's examine the area around coordinates (1,2) which shows a '3'. Looking at its adjacent cells:\n- Some are already revealed: (1,3) shows '1', (2,2) shows '2', and (2,3) is empty\n- The unrevealed cells are: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), and (2,1)\n\nNow looking at (2,2) which shows a '2':\n- Its adjacent revealed cells: (1,2)='3', (1,3)='1', (2,3)='_', (3,1)='1', (3,2)='1', (3,3)='_'\n- That leaves only (1,1) and (2,1) as unrevealed\n- Since (2,2) requires exactly 2 bombs in adjacent cells, both (1,1) and (2,1) MUST be bombs!\n\nThis is a definitive conclusion, so I'll flag one of these squares.\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the '2' at (2,2), there must be exactly 2 bombs in adjacent cells, and only (1,1) and (2,1) are unrevealed. Therefore, (1,1) must be a bomb.\nMOVE: 1,1,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n1 . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n2 . . 2 _ 1 1 2 1 1 _\n3 1 1 1 _ 1 . . . 1 _\n4 _ _ _ 1 2 2 . . 2 _\n5 _ _ _ 1 . 1 . . 1 _\n6 _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1 1 _\n7 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n8 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n9 . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
