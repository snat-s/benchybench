{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nLet's first analyze the current board state. I'm looking at a completely unexplored 10x10 Minesweeper board. There are 10 bombs in total and 10 flags available to mark these bombs.\n\nSince the board is completely unexplored, I don't have any revealed numbers or flags to analyze yet. In this situation, I need to make an initial move to start the game.\n\nIn Minesweeper, a good strategy for the first move is to click somewhere in the middle of the board rather than at the edges or corners. This is because the middle position has more surrounding squares (potentially 8), which increases the chances of revealing more information with a single click.\n\nSo, a good move would be to reveal a square near the center of the 10x10 board. The center would be around coordinates (4,4) or (5,5).\n\nI'll choose to reveal the square at coordinates (4,4), which is near the center of the board. This is a standard opening move in Minesweeper.\n\nLet's make this move:\n- Action: Reveal\n- Coordinates: (4,4)\n- flag = false (since I want to reveal, not flag)\n\nSo my move will be: 4,4,false\n</think>\n# Minesweeper First Move Analysis\n\nLooking at the completely unexplored 10x10 board with 10 mines, I need to make my first move.\n\n## Strategy for First Move\nFor the first move in Minesweeper, the optimal choice is typically to reveal a square near the center of the board. This is because:\n- Center squares have the maximum number of adjacent tiles (8)\n- This provides more information with a single move than edge or corner squares\n- Many implementations of Minesweeper actually guarantee that the first click is safe\n\n## My Decision\nI'll reveal a square near the center of the board at coordinates (4,4).\n\nEXPLANATION: Making an initial move near the center of the board to maximize information gained and follow standard Minesweeper opening strategy.\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
