We need to check if its two adjacent bombs are already flagged.\n\n### Determine Next Move:\n\n1. **Check for Conflicts:**\n   - (2,1) has 2 bombs adjacent. The number of flags around it does not match this information, hence a few more adjacent tiles need to be revealed to ensure we are not placing flags on tiles that will get a bomb marked wrongly.\n\n2. **Place a Flag:**\n   - Since there are conflicts and also as there are four remaining flags and we have a bomb on (2,7) and another at  (3,9). Our first priority must be adjoining flags around certain numbers and remove any incorrect flags or decisions in our actions.\n\n### Move Decisions:\nFor now, it's best to reveal a tile that confirms the number of adjacent bombs around them. Let's reveal the tile at `(2,2)` as it is the safest to reveal based on the current adjacent surroundings and see how it updates the game board.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nEXPLANATION: Serve it as a test for number allocations in adjacent flags to ensure the surrounding tiles are correctly flagged.
