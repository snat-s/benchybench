For the '1' at (0,4):\n   - Only one unexplored tile adjacent is (0,5). If this tile is a bomb, then (0,4) would be satisfied with its count of 1. However, if (0,5) is clear, we must consider the other adjacent unexplored tiles.\n  \n2. For the '1' at (1,1):\n   - It's surrounded by several locations, but it already sees (1,0) and the possible tiles it could assess neighbor-wise reducing probabilities of where bombs are and can safely place or remove flags.\n\n3. For 'clear' placements, noting the flag count is 10 remaining, we have multiple opportunities to safely reveal without conflict. \n\nNow, we can strategize moves.\n\n- Given the '1' at (0,4) which indicates it could be safe after checking (0,5), the tile (1,4) is adjacent to not only (1,3) and potentially (2,4). \n\nWe realize that spaces (0,5), (0,3) are unexplored and we might be able to open one of these.\n\nGiven all these factors, the next good move is to reveal (0,5), since this will clarify information and couldn't result in a conflict with the current bombs/flags around.\n\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal the tile at (0,5) to clarify information about possible bombs adjacent to the '1' at (0,4) and to check if there are any direct conflicts there. \nMOVE: 0,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n1 _ 1 1 1 1 . . . . .\n2 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n3 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

The top cells (0,0) to (1,1) have no immediate flags and need investigation.\n   - As the analysis proceeds, numbers like the '2' found at (1,3) can indicate potential placements for flags.\n\n3. **Conflict Check**:\n   - We must avoid placing a flag adjacent to a number that already has flagged counts exceeding what the number suggests.  \n   - For instance, evaluating (1,3) which is a '2', we find 1 potential flag at (0,5) beyond the count.\n\n4. **Remaining Flags**:\n   - There are currently 10 flags remaining, and 10 bombs expected. Thus we need to ensure that we are cautious in placement.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I suggest the following move:\n\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal the tile at (0,3) because there are no flagged tiles near (0,3) and revealing tiles will provide more information to correctly place flags according to the revealed numbers.\nMOVE: 0,3,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 . . .\n1 _ 1 1 1 1 . 1 . . .\n2 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n3 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n4 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
