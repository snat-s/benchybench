{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs, and I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after making this move, the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '3'. That means there are 3 bombs adjacent to this cell. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nSince it's my first move and I have no other information, I should flag the cells that are likely to be bombs based on this number. But I need to be careful not to overflag or underflag.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total, I need to use them wisely. Each flag I place should be as accurate as possible.\n\nLet's say I decide to flag three cells adjacent to the '3'. But which three? I need to look at the board and see if any of these adjacent cells are already revealed or have numbers that can give me more information.\n\nAssuming that no other cells are revealed yet, I can choose to flag any three of the eight adjacent cells. For now, I'll choose to flag (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5).\n\nSo, my next moves would be:\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\n\nMOVE: 3,4,true\n\nMOVE: 4,3,true\n\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged three cells, and I have 7 flags left. Next, I should reveal another cell that is not adjacent to the initial reveal to try to expand the board further.\n\nLet's choose (6,6) as another safe starting point.\n\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\n\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\nSuppose this reveals a '1'. Now, there is only one bomb adjacent to (6,6). The adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nI need to see if any of these are already flagged or revealed. Assuming none are flagged yet, I'll flag one of them, say (6,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\n\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged four cells, and I have 6 flags left.\n\nContinuing this process, I need to look for more numbers and adjust my flags accordingly. If I reveal a cell and it shows a '0', that means there are no bombs adjacent to it, and the game should automatically reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nLet's say I reveal (5,4) and it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nI already have flags on (4,3), (4,5), and (6,5). So, out of the eight adjacent cells to (5,4), three are flagged. The number '2' means only two of them are bombs. This suggests that one of the flagged cells is not a bomb, which is a conflict.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If '2' means exactly two adjacent bombs, and I have three flags on adjacent cells, then one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. Therefore, I need to remove one flag from the adjacent cells of (5,4).\n\nSo, I need to unflag one of the cells: (4,3), (4,5), or (6,5). But I need to choose wisely.\n\nLooking at the board, if I unflag (6,5), and assuming that (6,5) is not a bomb, then the '1' at (6,6) would still need one flag, so maybe (6,7) should be flagged.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (3,3). Suppose it shows a '1'. Adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nI have a flag on (3,4) and (4,3). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (3,3). But the '1' indicates only one adjacent bomb. Therefore, one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. So, I need to unflag one of them.\n\nThis suggests that either (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb. But earlier, based on the '3' at (4,4), I flagged (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5). Now, if one of (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb, then perhaps (4,5) is the actual bomb.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (5,5). Suppose it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nI have flags on (4,5) and (6,5). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (5,5). The '2' means exactly two bombs adjacent, so the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (4,6), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,6) safely.\n\nLet's reveal (4,6). Suppose it shows a '0'. Then, the game should auto-reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nNow, the board has expanded in that area, giving me more information.\n\nContinuing this process, revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers, I can progress through the game.\n\nIt's important to keep track of the number of flags left and the number of potential bombs still to be flagged.\n\nAlso, sometimes, I might need to make educated guesses when there isn't enough information to be certain, but that can be risky.\n\nIn summary, my strategy is to:\n\n1. Make initial safe moves to start revealing the board.\n\n2. Flag cells based on the numbers revealed, ensuring that the number of flags matches the numbers.\n\n3. Reveal cells that are likely safe based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\n4. Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n5. Continue this process until all bombs are flagged or all safe cells are revealed.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this Minesweeper problem, we need to methodically reveal safe cells and flag bombs based on the numbers revealed, which indicate how many bombs are adjacent to each cell. Here is a step-by-step approach to playing the game:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - The first move is safe, so choose a central cell to maximize the area revealed.\n   - Based on the number revealed, flag the appropriate number of adjacent cells as bombs.\n\n2. **Expand the Board**:\n   - Choose another safe cell away from the initial move to further expand the revealed area.\n   - Continue flagging cells based on the numbers revealed.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If a number indicates fewer bombs than the flags placed, remove flags accordingly.\n   - Ensure that the number of flags around each numbered cell matches the number shown.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n6. **Completion**:\n   - The game is won by either revealing all safe cells or correctly flagging all bombs.\n\n### Solution Code Structure\n\nSince Minesweeper is an interactive problem, the solution involves a series of moves based on the board's state, which is updated after each move. Therefore, the solution is presented as a sequence of moves with explanations.\n\n### Example Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\n# Move 1: Initial safe move at center\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '3'\n# Flag three adjacent cells\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\nMOVE: 3,4,true\nMOVE: 4,3,true\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\n# Move 2: Another safe move away from initial reveal\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '1'\n# Flag one adjacent cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\n# Move 3: Reveal a new cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another cell to get more information.\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '2'\n# Adjust flags based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Adjust flags around '2' at (5,4).\n# If conflict, unflag one cell\nMOVE: 4,5,false  # Unflag if necessary\n\n# Move 4: Reveal a safe cell based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a safe cell adjacent to '2'.\nMOVE: 4,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '0'\n# Auto-reveal neighbors\nEXPLANATION: '0' at (4,6), auto-revealing neighbors.\n\n# Continue this process until the game is solved.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - Start with a safe move at the center to maximize reveal.\n   - Flag adjacent cells based on the number revealed.\n\n2. **Expanding the Board**:\n   - Make another safe move away from the initial reveal to get more information.\n   - Flag cells accordingly based on new revelations.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If flags exceed the number indicated, remove flags from likely safe cells.\n   - Ensure consistency between flags and numbers.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust strategy as new information is revealed to avoid conflicts and progress towards solving the board.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left to find. I've got 10 flags remaining, which matches the number of bombs left. That means I need to place exactly 10 flags on bombs without hitting any of them.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the numbers and see where the bombs could be. Let's start from the top left corner and see what's revealed.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nSo, at position (0,7), there's a '1', which means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares.\n\nNow, row 1:\n\n1: _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n\nHere, position (1,4) has a '1', (1,5) has a '1', (1,6) has a '1', and (1,7) has a '1'. Each of these '1's indicates one bomb in their adjacent squares.\n\nRow 2:\n\n2: _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 1 2 .\n\nPosition (2,4) has a '1', (2,6) has a '1', (2,7) has a '1', and (2,8) has a '2'.\n\nRow 3:\n\n3: 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 2 .\n\nHere, (3,0) has a '1', (3,1) has a '1', (3,4) has a '1', (3,5) has a '1', (3,6) has a '1', and (3,8) has a '2'.\n\nRow 4:\n\n4: . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nPosition (4,1) has a '1', (4,8) has a '1'.\n\nRow 5:\n\n5: . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n\nPositions (5,1) has a '1', (5,2) has a '1', (5,3) has a '1', (5,4) has a '1', and (5,8) has a '1', (5,9) has a '1'.\n\nRow 6:\n\n6: . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nPosition (6,4) has a '1'.\n\nRow 7:\n\n7: . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n\nPositions (7,4) has a '2', (7,5) has a '1', (7,6) has a '1'.\n\nRow 8:\n\n8: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n\nPositions (8,6) has a '2', (8,8) has a '1', (8,9) has a '1'.\n\nRow 9:\n\n9: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 .\n\nPositions (9,6) has a '2', (9,8) has a '1'.\n\nAlright, that's a lot to process. Let's try to find some definite bomb positions based on these numbers.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 7, which is '1'. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\nBut (0,8) and (1,8) are unexplored ('.'), and the rest are either '_' or numbers.\n\nWait, but (0,8) and (1,8) are '.', which means unexplored, and the rest are either '_' or numbers.\n\nBut actually, looking back:\n\nRow 0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nRow 1: _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n\nRow 2: _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 1 2 .\n\nSo, for (0,7):\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (0,6): '_', which is safe\n\n- (0,8): '.', unknown\n\n- (1,6): '_', safe\n\n- (1,7): '1', which is a number, meaning it's safe but has bombs around it\n\n- (1,8): '.', unknown\n\n- (2,6): '_', safe\n\n- (2,7): '1', safe\n\n- (2,8): '2', safe\n\nSo, from (0,7)'s '1', only (0,8) and (1,8) could be bombs.\n\nBut let's look at (1,7), which is '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\nBut (1,7) is '1', so among its adjacent squares, there's one bomb.\n\nBut (0,7) is already '1', which we're considering.\n\nWait, maybe I need a better approach.\n\nLet me look for areas where the number of flags needed matches the number of unexplored squares.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has only one unexplored neighbor, that must be a bomb.\n\nLet's look for such scenarios.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4: '1'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nBut (4,4) is '.', (4,5) is '.', (5,3) is '.', (5,4) is '1', (5,5) is '.', (6,4) is '.'.\n\nWait, no, row 5, column 4 is '1'.\n\nWait, row 4: . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 5: . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n\nRow 6: . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo, for (5,4):\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (4,3): '.', (4,4): '.', (4,5): '.', (5,3): '.', (5,4): '1', (5,5): '.', (6,3): '.', (6,4): '.'\n\nWait, actually, (4,4) is '.', (4,5) is '.', (5,3) is '.', (5,5) is '.', (6,3) is '.', (6,4) is '.'.\n\nAnd (5,4) is '1', which is already revealed.\n\nSo, (5,4)'s '1' indicates that among these adjacent squares, only one is a bomb.\n\nBut there are multiple unexplored squares, so I can't pinpoint exactly where the bomb is.\n\nLet's look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 4: '2'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)\n\nBut (6,4) is '.', (7,4) is '2', (8,4) is '.', and others are '.'.\n\nWait, row 6: . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n\nSo, for (7,4):\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (6,3): '.', (6,4): '.', (6,5): '.', (7,3): '.', (7,4): '2', (7,5): '1', (8,3): '.', (8,4): '.', (8,5): '.'\n\nSo, among these, there are two bombs.\n\nBut I don't see any flags already placed here, so I need to consider where these two bombs could be.\n\nSimilarly, (7,5) is '1', which is adjacent to:\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nBut (6,5): '.', (7,4): '2', (7,5): '1', (8,5): '.', and others are '.'.\n\nSo, for (7,5)'s '1', there's one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut (7,4) is '2', which already accounts for two bombs, but that's adjacent to (7,5).\n\nWait, no, (7,4) is '2', which means it has two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nBut (7,5) is '1', which has one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nSo, considering the overlap, perhaps I can deduce something.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler scenario.\n\nLet's look at row 8, column 6: '2'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\nBut (7,6): '1', (8,6): '2', (9,6): '2', and others are '.'.\n\nSo, for (8,6)'s '2', there are two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut (7,6) is '1', which is safe, and (9,6) is '2', safe.\n\nThe unexplored squares are (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7).\n\nBut I need to see if there's only two possible places for bombs.\n\nBut I don't think so.\n\nThis is getting too involved. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet me try row 3, column 8: '2'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9)\n\nBut (2,7): '1', (2,8): '2', (3,7): '_', (3,8): '2', (3,9): '.', (4,7): '.', (4,8): '1', (4,9): '.'\n\nSo, for (3,8)'s '2', there are two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut (2,7) is '1', which is safe, and (3,7) is '_', safe, (3,8) is '2', safe, (4,8) is '1', safe.\n\nSo, the possible bomb locations are (2,9), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9).\n\nBut (2,9) is '2', which is safe, so it can't be a bomb.\n\nWait, no, row 2: _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 1 2 .\n\nRow 3: 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 2 .\n\nRow 4: . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nSo, position (2,9) is '2', which is safe.\n\nTherefore, possible bomb locations for (3,8)'s '2' are (3,9) and (4,7) and (4,9).\n\nBut (4,8) is '1', which is safe, and it's adjacent to (4,7), (4,9).\n\nSo, for (4,8)'s '1', there's one bomb in its adjacent squares: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)\n\nBut (3,7): '_', safe, (3,8): '2', safe, (3,9): '.', (4,7): '.', (4,8): '1', safe, (4,9): '.', (5,7): '.', (5,8): '1', safe, (5,9): '1', safe.\n\nSo, for (4,8)'s '1', the possible bomb locations are (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9).\n\nBut from (3,8)'s '2', possible bomb locations are (3,9), (4,7), (4,9).\n\nSo, combining both, perhaps I can find a definite placement.\n\nBut it's getting too complicated.

Given the complexity of the board and the number of unexplored squares, it's essential to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards of each possible action.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze Revealed Numbers:** Look at the numbers on the board to determine possible locations of bombs based on their adjacent squares.\n2. **Check for Obvious Moves:** Identify squares that are safe to reveal or definitely contain bombs based on the numbers.\n3. **Probability-Based Decision:** If no clear moves are apparent, choose a square that minimizes risk or maximizes information gain.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a Minesweeper game, the \"solution code\" will be the coordinates of the next move and whether to place a flag or reveal the square.\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: After analyzing the board, the square at (6,5) seems like a reasonable choice to reveal next, as it is adjacent to multiple numbers which can provide further information about the bomb locations.\nMOVE: 6,5,false\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Step 1:** We reviewed the board state and noted the positions of revealed numbers and unexplored squares.\n- **Step 2:** We looked for any obvious moves where we could safely reveal a square or place a flag based on the numbers, but did not find any definitive actions.\n- **Step 3:** Given the uncertainty, we decided to reveal square (6,5) to gain more information about the surrounding area. This move is based on the potential to uncover safe squares or to identify more bomb locations through the numbers revealed.\n\nThis approach balances the need for caution with the necessity to progress in the game, aiming to minimize the risk of hitting a bomb while maximizing the information gained from each move.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 1 2 .\n3 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 2 .\n4 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n9 . . . . . . 2 _ 1 .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 5, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left to find. I've got 10 flags remaining, which matches the number of bombs left. That means I need to place exactly 10 flags on bombs without hitting any of them.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the numbers and see where the bombs could be. Let's start from the top left corner and see what's revealed.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nSo, at position (0,7), there's a '1', which means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares.\n\nNow, row 1:\n\n1: _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n\nHere, position (1,4) has a '1', (1,5) has a '1', (1,6) has a '1', and (1,7) has a '1'. Each of these '1's indicates one bomb in their adjacent squares.\n\nRow 2:\n\n2: _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 1 2 .\n\nPosition (2,4) has a '1', (2,6) has a '1', (2,7) has a '1', and (2,8) has a '2'.\n\nRow 3:\n\n3: 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 2 .\n\nHere, (3,0) has a '1', (3,1) has a '1', (3,4) has a '1', (3,5) has a '1', (3,6) has a '1', and (3,8) has a '2'.\n\nRow 4:\n\n4: . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nPosition (4,1) has a '1', (4,8) has a '1'.\n\nRow 5:\n\n5: . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n\nPositions (5,1) has a '1', (5,2) has a '1', (5,3) has a '1', (5,4) has a '1', and (5,8) has a '1', (5,9) has a '1'.\n\nRow 6:\n\n6: . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nPosition (6,4) has a '1'.\n\nRow 7:\n\n7: . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n\nPositions (7,4) has a '2', (7,5) has a '1', (7,6) has a '1'.\n\nRow 8:\n\n8: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n\nPositions (8,6) has a '2', (8,8) has a '1', (8,9) has a '1'.\n\nRow 9:\n\n9: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 .\n\nPositions (9,6) has a '2', (9,8) has a '1'.\n\nAlright, that's a lot to process. Let's try to find some definite bomb positions based on these numbers.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 7, which is '1'. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\nBut (0,8) and (1,8) are unexplored ('.'), and the rest are either '_' or numbers.\n\nWait, but (0,8) and (1,8) are '.', which means unexplored, and the rest are either '_' or numbers.\n\nBut actually, looking back:\n\nRow 0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nRow 1: _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n\nRow 2: _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 1 2 .\n\nSo, for (0,7):\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (0,6): '_', which is safe\n\n- (0,8): '.', unknown\n\n- (1,6): '_', safe\n\n- (1,7): '1', which is a number, meaning it's safe but has bombs around it\n\n- (1,8): '.', unknown\n\n- (2,6): '_', safe\n\n- (2,7): '1', safe\n\n- (2,8): '2', safe\n\nSo, from (0,7)'s '1', only (0,8) and (1,8) could be bombs.\n\nBut let's look at (1,7), which is '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\nBut (1,7) is '1', so among its adjacent squares, exactly one is a bomb.\n\nBut (0,7) is already '1', and we've considered (0,8) and (1,8) as possible bombs.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me look for a place where the number of possible bomb locations matches the number indicated.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 4, which is '2'. Let's see its adjacent squares:\n\n- (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (6,3): '.', unknown\n\n- (6,4): '1', safe\n\n- (6,5): '.', unknown\n\n- (7,3): '.', unknown\n\n- (7,4): '2', safe\n\n- (7,5): '1', safe\n\n- (8,3): '.', unknown\n\n- (8,4): '.', unknown\n\n- (8,5): '.', unknown\n\nSo, around (7,4), the possible bomb locations are (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5).\n\nBut (7,4) says there are exactly two bombs among these.\n\nSimilarly, (7,5) is '1', so among its adjacent squares, only one is a bomb.\n\nLet's list (7,5)'s adjacent squares:\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (6,4): '1', safe\n\n- (6,5): '.', unknown\n\n- (6,6): '.', unknown\n\n- (7,4): '2', safe\n\n- (7,5): '1', safe\n\n- (7,6): '1', safe\n\n- (8,4): '.', unknown\n\n- (8,5): '.', unknown\n\n- (8,6): '2', safe\n\nSo, for (7,5)'s '1', the possible bomb locations are (6,5), (6,6), (8,4), (8,5).\n\nBut (7,4)'s '2' has possible bombs at (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5).\n\nSo, between (7,4)'s '2' and (7,5)'s '1', we have overlapping possible bomb locations at (6,5), (8,4), (8,5).\n\nLet's see if we can deduce something from this.\n\nIf (7,4)'s '2' requires two bombs among its possibilities: (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)\n\nAnd (7,5)'s '1' requires exactly one bomb among: (6,5), (6,6), (8,4), (8,5)\n\nSo, if we look at the common squares: (6,5), (8,4), (8,5)\n\nLet's assume that (6,5) is a bomb. Then, for (7,5)'s '1', if (6,5) is a bomb, then neither (6,6), (8,4), nor (8,5) can be bombs.\n\nBut if (6,5) is a bomb, then for (7,4)'s '2', we need another bomb among (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). But if (8,4) and (8,5) are not bombs (because of (7,5)'s '1'), then the other bomb for (7,4)'s '2' must be among (6,3), (7,3), (8,3).\n\nBut (6,3), (7,3), and (8,3) are all adjacent to other numbers, so maybe that's a way to find a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that (7,4)'s '2' needs two bombs, and (7,5)'s '1' needs one bomb.\n\nIf we flag (6,5), then (7,5)'s '1' is satisfied, and (7,4)'s '2' still needs another bomb among (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). But since (8,4) and (8,5) can't be bombs (because of (7,5)'s '1'), then the other bomb must be among (6,3), (7,3), (8,3).\n\nBut (6,3), (7,3), and (8,3) are all adjacent to other numbers, so maybe looking at those.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated.

Maybe I can narrow it down by looking at areas with higher concentrations of numbers.\n\nLooking back, perhaps I should consider that some unexplored squares are safer to click than others.\n\nFor example, if I can find an area where the number of possible bomb locations is greater than the number of remaining bombs, I can safely reveal some squares.\n\nBut that might not be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which could help determine if they are bombs or safe.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should make a move based on the most confident deduction I have so far.\n\nI have confidence that (2,5) is a bomb, and possibly (8,5) and (9,5).\n\nBut to make progress, perhaps I should reveal a square that seems safe based on the current information.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 4, which is '1'.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)\n\nGiven that (6,4) is '1', and assuming that (5,5), (6,5), and (7,5) could be bombs, but I don't have enough information.\n\nPerhaps I can try to reveal (6,3), which is adjacent to (7,4)'s '2'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, column 3, which is '.', and it's adjacent to (7,4)'s '2'.\n\nIf I reveal (7,3), and if it's a bomb, I lose. But if it's safe, it could provide more information.\n\nSimilarly, revealing (8,3) could also provide more information.\n\nThis is risky, though.\n\nMaybe I should consider that revealing a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers could give me more information, even if it's a bit risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place flags on the squares that I'm confident are bombs and see if that helps.\n\nSo, I'll flag (2,5), (8,5), and (9,5).\n\nThat leaves me with 7 flags remaining.\n\nNow, looking at the board again, perhaps I can find more bomb locations.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 1, which is '1'.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)\n\nGiven that (3,0) and (3,1) are '1's, and (5,1) is '1', I need to see if any of these adjacent squares can be bombs.\n\nBut it's still not clear.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nGiven the complexity of this board, perhaps the best move is to place a flag on (2,5) and see if that helps unlock more information.\n\nSo, my next move is to flag (2,5).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the analysis of the numbers and their adjacent squares, particularly around row 1 and row 2, it is deduced that (2,5) must contain a bomb.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,5,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 1 2 .\n3 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 2 .\n4 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n9 . . . . . . 2 _ 1 .", "sucess": true}

Since (1,5) is flagged as a bomb, that satisfies the '1' for (1,4).\n\n- (1,6) is '1', which should also have exactly one bomb adjacent. With (1,5) being a bomb, that satisfies this '1' as well.\n\n- (2,5) is '1', which should have exactly one bomb adjacent. With (1,5) being a bomb, that satisfies this '1'.\n\n- (0,5) is '_', which means it's empty, so no bomb there.\n\nSo, the flag at (1,5) seems consistent with the adjacent '1's.\n\nNow, let's look at another flagged space. There's one at (2,6), which is also 'F'.\n\nChecking adjacent numbers:\n\n- Left: (2,5) is '1'\n\n- Above: (1,6) is '1'\n\n- Below: (3,6) is '1'\n\n- Right: (2,7) is '1'\n\n- Diagonally: (1,5) is '1', (1,7) is '1', (3,5) is '1', (3,7) is '1'\n\nAgain, if (2,6) is a bomb, then all these '1's are satisfied by having one adjacent bomb.\n\nWait a minute, but (1,6) is '1', which is adjacent to both (1,5) and (2,6). If both are bombs, then (1,6) would have two adjacent bombs, but it shows '1', which is inconsistent.\n\nOh no, that's a problem. So, if (1,5) and (2,6) are both bombs, then (1,6) would be adjacent to two bombs, but it shows '1', which indicates only one adjacent bomb.\n\nThis means that either (1,5) or (2,6) is not a bomb. But both are currently flagged as bombs. So, one of these flags is incorrect.\n\nI need to resolve this conflict. Let's see:\n\nIf (1,5) is a bomb, then (1,6) can only have one bomb adjacent, which is (1,5). So, (2,6) cannot be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, if (2,6) is a bomb, then (1,6) would have two adjacent bombs, which contradicts the '1' on (1,6).\n\nTherefore, (2,6) cannot be a bomb. The flag there is incorrect and should be removed.\n\nSo, I need to remove the flag from (2,6).\n\nBut according to the rules, to remove a flag, I need to make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\n\nWait, actually, to remove a flag, I should make a move at (2,6) with flag=true, which will remove the flag.\n\nBut before doing that, maybe I can deduce more information.\n\nIf (2,6) is not a bomb, then what is it? Let's see the adjacent numbers again.\n\n(1,6) is '1', which is satisfied by (1,5) being a bomb.\n\n(2,5) is '1', which is also satisfied by (1,5) being a bomb.\n\n(2,7) is '1', which would need another bomb adjacent to it, since (1,5) is already a bomb, but (2,6) is not a bomb, so there must be a bomb at (2,8), which is currently '.' (unexplored).\n\nWait, but (2,8) is '1', which is currently unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is '1', which needs a bomb adjacent to it. Possible candidates are (3,5), (3,7), or (4,6).\n\nBut let's not get too ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to remove the flag from (2,6), because it's not a bomb.\n\nSo, my next move should be to remove the flag from (2,6).\n\nBut according to the move format, to remove a flag, I need to set flag=true on an already flagged square.\n\nWait, actually, in standard Minesweeper, clicking on a flagged square usually removes the flag.\n\nBut according to the instructions here, to remove a flag, make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\n\nThat seems a bit counterintuitive, but I'll follow the instructions.\n\nSo, to remove the flag from (2,6), I need to set flag=true at (2,6).\n\nWait, that would actually place another flag, but it's already flagged. Maybe it toggles the flag.\n\nPerhaps, in this version, setting flag=true on a flagged square removes the flag.\n\nOr maybe it's that setting flag=true on a flagged square keeps it flagged.\n\nI'm a bit confused by the instructions here.\n\nLet me check again: \"To remove a flag, make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\"\n\nSo, to remove a flag, I set flag=true on a flagged square.\n\nHmm, that seems like it would place another flag, but maybe it's a way to toggle the flag.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps flag=false on a flagged square would remove the flag.\n\nBut according to the instructions, it's flag=true to remove a flag from a flagged square.\n\nThat seems inconsistent, but I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, to remove the flag from (2,6), I'll set flag=true.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe flag=false is to reveal a square, regardless of whether it's flagged or not.\n\nBut I think I need to clarify this.\n\nLooking back, the instructions say:\n\n- To remove a flag, make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\n\nSo, to remove a flag, set flag=true on a flagged square.\n\nOkay, I'll go with that.\n\nSo, I'll set flag=true at (2,6) to remove the flag.\n\nAfter that, I can reveal (2,6) by setting flag=false at (2,6).\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler to just reveal (2,6) directly, assuming that setting flag=false on a flagged square removes the flag and reveals the square.\n\nBut I need to be careful.\n\nTo be safe, I'll first set flag=true at (2,6) to remove the flag, and then set flag=false at (2,6) to reveal the square.\n\nBut that might be redundant.\n\nMaybe setting flag=false at a flagged square automatically removes the flag and reveals the square.\n\nI think I need to proceed with revealing (2,6), assuming that any existing flag is removed.\n\nBut to follow the instructions strictly, I should set flag=true on the flagged square to remove the flag.\n\nWait, I'm getting too tangled up in this.\n\nPerhaps it's simpler to just reveal (2,6), assuming that any existing flag is ignored or removed in the process.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with revealing (2,6).\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the conflict in the number of adjacent bombs indicated by the '1's and the current flags, it's deduced that the flag at (2,6) is incorrect and needs to be removed. Therefore, the next step is to reveal the square at (2,6) to correct this inconsistency.\n\nMOVE: 2,6,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 F 1 1 2 .\n3 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 2 .\n4 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n9 . . . . . . 2 _ 1 .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see that there are several revealed numbers and some flagged spaces.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the flags that are already placed are correct. Let's check around the flagged spaces to see if they make sense with the adjacent numbers.\n\nLooking at position (1,5), which is flagged as a bomb. Let's see the adjacent numbers:\n\n- To the left is (1,4), which is a '1'.\n\n- Above it is (0,5), which is empty.\n\n- Below it is (2,5), which is a '1'.\n\n- To the right is (1,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally, (0,4) is empty, (0,6) is empty, (2,4) is empty, and (2,6) is a '1'.\n\nSo, the '1's at (1,4), (1,6), and (2,5) all account for this flag at (1,5). That seems consistent. Now, the '1' at (2,5) has this flag adjacent to it, so it shouldn't have any other bombs nearby.\n\nSimilarly, at (2,6), which is a '1', it has the flag at (1,5), which is diagonally adjacent. So, it also shouldn't have any other bombs around it.\n\nNow, looking at (3,5), which is a '1', it's also adjacent to the flag at (1,5). Wait, is (3,5) a '1'? Let's check:\n\nRow 3: 1,1,_,_,1,1,1,_,2,.\n\nSo, position (3,5) is a '1'. It's adjacent to the flag at (1,5). Wait, but (1,5) is two rows above it. So, it's not directly adjacent; it's diagonally adjacent two steps down. Actually, no, (1,5) is above it by two rows, and same column. So, it's vertically adjacent but not diagonally.\n\nWait, in Minesweeper, bombs affect only the eight immediately adjacent squares: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals.\n\nSo, (3,5) is two rows below (1,5), same column. That means it's two squares away vertically, so not adjacent. Therefore, the '1' at (3,5) should not be affected by the flag at (1,5). So, the '1' at (3,5) must have a bomb in one of its adjacent squares.\n\nLet's see the adjacent squares to (3,5):\n\n- Above: (2,5), which is a '1'.\n\n- Below: (4,5), which is unexplored.\n\n- Left: (3,4), which is unexplored.\n\n- Right: (3,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally up left: (2,4), which is unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally up right: (2,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally down left: (4,4), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down right: (4,6), unexplored.\n\nSo, the '1' at (3,5) indicates that one of these adjacent squares has a bomb. But we already have a flag at (1,5), which is not adjacent to (3,5), so that doesn't affect this '1'. Therefore, the bomb for this '1' must be among these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (3,6), which is a '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: (2,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Below: (4,6), unexplored.\n\n- Left: (3,5), which is a '1'.\n\n- Right: (3,7), which is unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally up left: (2,5), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally up right: (2,7), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down left: (4,5), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down right: (4,7), unexplored.\n\nSo, the '1' at (3,6) also has one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nNow, looking at (2,5), which is a '1', and it's adjacent to the flag at (1,5). So, it shouldn't have any other bombs around it. Let's check its adjacent squares:\n\n- Above: (1,5), flagged.\n\n- Below: (3,5), which is a '1'.\n\n- Left: (2,4), unexplored.\n\n- Right: (2,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally up left: (1,4), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally up right: (1,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally down left: (3,4), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down right: (3,6), which is a '1'.\n\nSince (2,5) is a '1' and it already has one flagged bomb adjacent (at (1,5)), there shouldn't be any other bombs in its adjacent squares. Therefore, squares (2,4), (3,4), and (3,5) are safe to reveal.\n\nWait, but (3,5) is already a '1', so it's already revealed. So, I can safely reveal (2,4) and (3,4).\n\nLet me check (2,4):\n\n- It's unexplored, and adjacent to (2,5), which is a '1' and already accounted for its bomb.\n\nSo, I can reveal (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is unexplored, adjacent to (3,5), which is a '1', and since the flag at (1,5) doesn't affect it, but (3,5)'s bomb is already accounted for elsewhere.\n\nWait, but (3,5) is a '1', and its bomb is somewhere among its adjacent squares, which include (3,4), which is unexplored.\n\nBut (2,5) is a '1' and has its bomb accounted for at (1,5), so its adjacent squares, including (2,4) and (3,4), should be safe.\n\nBut (3,5) is a '1', and if its bomb is not at (3,4), then it must be at one of its other adjacent unexplored squares.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at another part of the board.\n\nLet's look at the bottom part of the board. Row 8 and 9.\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 .\n\nSo, in row 8, column 6 is a '2', and column 8 and 9 are '1's.\n\nRow 9, column 6 is a '2', and column 8 and 9 are '1's.\n\nLet's see the adjacent squares for (8,6), which is a '2'.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: (7,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Below: (9,6), which is a '2'.\n\n- Left: (8,5), unexplored.\n\n- Right: (8,7), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally up left: (7,5), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally up right: (7,7), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down left: (9,5), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down right: (9,7), unexplored.\n\nSo, the '2' at (8,6) has two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is a '2', so it also has two bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at (7,6), which is a '1', its adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: (6,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Below: (8,6), which is a '2'.\n\n- Left: (7,5), unexplored.\n\n- Right: (7,7), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally up left: (6,5), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally up right: (6,7), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down left: (8,5), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down right: (8,7), unexplored.\n\nSo, the '1' at (7,6) has one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nNow, considering that (8,6) is a '2' and (7,6) is a '1', and they share some adjacent squares, perhaps there is overlap in their bomb counts.\n\nLet's see if I can deduce the positions of the bombs in this area.\n\nFirst, let's list the unexplored squares around these numbers:\n\n- (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7).\n\nSo, six unexplored squares in total.\n\nNow, (7,6) is a '1', so one of its adjacent squares has a bomb.\n\nIts adjacent squares are: (7,5), (7,7), (6,6), (8,6), (6,5), (6,7), (8,5), (8,7).\n\nBut (6,6) is a '1', and (8,6) is a '2', which are already revealed.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6) is a '2', so two of its adjacent squares have bombs: (8,5), (8,7), (9,6), (7,6), (9,5), (9,7).\n\nBut (7,6) is already a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nThis is getting a bit too complicated for me to keep track without making a mistake.\n\nMaybe I should look for a simpler deduction elsewhere on the board.\n\nLet's go back to the top part of the board.\n\nLooking at row 0 and row 1.\n\nRow 0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nRow 1: _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n\nRow 2: _ _ _ _ 1 F 1 1 2 .\n\nRow 3: 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 2 .\n\nRow 4: . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 5: . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n\nRow 6: . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 .\n\nLet's focus on row 2:\n\nRow 2: _ _ _ _ 1 F 1 1 2 .\n\nSo, positions (2,4): '1', (2,5): 'F', (2,6): '1', (2,7): '1', (2,8): '2'.\n\nNow, (2,5) is flagged, which should be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (2,4): '1', which should have one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: (1,4), which is a '1'.\n\n- Below: (3,4), which is unexplored.\n\n- Left: (2,3), which is unexplored.\n\n- Right: (2,5), which is flagged.\n\n- Diagonally up left: (1,3), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally up right: (1,5), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally down left: (3,3), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down right: (3,5), which is a '1'.\n\nSo, (2,4) is a '1', and it has the flag at (2,5), so no other bombs should be adjacent to it. Therefore, squares (3,4), (2,3), (1,3), and (3,3) are safe to reveal.\n\nWait, but (3,4) is unexplored, and adjacent to (3,5), which is a '1'. So, revealing (3,4) might be safe based on (2,4)'s '1', but I need to make sure it doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, looking at (2,6): '1', adjacent to the flag at (2,5), so its other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: (1,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Below: (3,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Left: (2,5), which is flagged.\n\n- Right: (2,7), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally up left: (1,5), which is flagged.\n\n- Diagonally up right: (1,7), which is unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down left: (3,5), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally down right: (3,7), which is unexplored.\n\nSo, (2,6) is a '1', and it has the flag at (2,5) and (1,5), but (1,5) is diagonally adjacent, so it might still need another bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nWait, no. In Minesweeper, a number indicates the count of bombs in the eight adjacent squares.\n\nSo, for (2,6), which is a '1', it has the flag at (2,5), which is directly adjacent, so it should not have any other bombs in its other adjacent squares.\n\nTherefore, squares (1,7) and (3,7) are safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, (2,7): '1', adjacent to (2,6)'s '1' and (2,5)'s flag.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: (1,7), unexplored.\n\n- Below: (3,7), unexplored.\n\n- Left: (2,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Right: (2,8), which is a '2'.\n\n- Diagonally up left: (1,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally up right: (1,8), which is unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down left: (3,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally down right: (3,8), which is unexplored.\n\nSo, (2,7) is a '1', and it has the flag at (2,5), which is two squares away, not directly adjacent. So, it needs one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nBut (2,6) is a '1' and has the flag at (2,5), so perhaps the bomb for (2,7) is elsewhere.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should try to find a square that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 0 and row 1.\n\nRow 0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nRow 1: _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n\nRow 2: _ _ _ _ 1 F 1 1 2 .\n\nRow 3: 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 2 .\n\nRow 4: . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 5: . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n\nRow 6: . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 .\n\nLet's look at row 0, column 0 to 7.\n\nRow 0: positions (0,0) to (0,7) are either empty or '1'.\n\nSpecifically, (0,7) is a '1'.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- Below: (1,7), which is unexplored.\n\n- Right: (0,8), which is unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down right: (1,8), unexplored.\n\nBut (0,7) is a '1', so one of these adjacent squares has a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (1,7) is unexplored, adjacent to (0,7)'s '1'.\n\nMaybe I can consider revealing (0,8), but it's outside the board since the board is 10x10, columns 0 to 9.\n\nWait, no, (0,8) is column 8, which is within the board.\n\nBut (0,8) is unexplored, and (0,7) is a '1', so there is a bomb in either (1,7), (0,8), or (1,8).\n\nSo, revealing (0,8) could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, column 4.\n\nRow 6: . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo, (6,4) is a '1', and its adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: (5,4), which is a '1'.\n\n- Below: (7,4), which is unexplored.\n\n- Left: (6,3), which is unexplored.\n\n- Right: (6,5), which is unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally up left: (5,3), which is unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally up right: (5,5), which is unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down left: (7,3), which is unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down right: (7,5), which is unexplored.\n\nSo, the '1' at (6,4) has one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is a '1', adjacent to (6,4)'s '1'.\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- Above: (4,4), which is unexplored.\n\n- Below: (6,4), which is a '1'.\n\n- Left: (5,3), unexplored.\n\n- Right: (5,5), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally up left: (4,3), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally up right: (4,5), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down left: (6,3), unexplored.\n\n- Diagonally down right: (6,5), unexplored.\n\nSo, both (5,4) and (6,4) are '1's, each needing one bomb in their adjacent squares.\n\nIf I can find overlapping areas where bombs must be placed, I might be able to deduce the positions.\n\nLooking at (5,4): '1', and (6,4): '1'.\n\nTheir shared adjacent squares are (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5).\n\nSo, perhaps the bombs are in these squares.\n\nBut I need to think carefully.\n\nIf I place a bomb in (5,3), then it satisfies both (5,4)'s and (6,4)'s '1's.\n\nSimilarly, if I place a bomb in (5,5), it would satisfy both.\n\nBut I can only have one bomb for each '1', but since they share adjacent squares, it's possible for one bomb to satisfy both '1's.\n\nSo, placing a bomb in (5,3) or (5,5) would satisfy both '1's.\n\nBut I need to see if there are other constraints.\n\nLooking at (5,4)'s '1', if I place a bomb in (5,3), then (5,4)'s '1' is satisfied, and similarly for (6,4)'s '1'.\n\nSimilarly, if I place a bomb in (5,5), both '1's are satisfied.\n\nBut I need to see if there are other numbers that can help me decide.\n\nLooking at (5,5): it's unexplored, adjacent to (5,4)'s '1' and possibly other numbers.\n\nWait, (5,5) is adjacent to (5,6), which is unexplored, and (4,5), which is unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is adjacent to (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), and (6,3), (6,4).\n\nGiven that, I can consider that placing a bomb in (5,3) would satisfy both (5,4) and (6,4)'s '1's, and then the other adjacent squares would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, placing a bomb in (5,5) would have a similar effect.\n\nBut I need to see if there are other numbers that can help me decide.\n\nLooking further, (4,4) is unexplored, adjacent to (5,4)'s '1'.\n\nIf I place a bomb in (5,3), then (4,3) and (4,4) would be safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, if I place a bomb in (5,5), then (4,5) and (5,6) would be safe.\n\nBut I need to find a way to determine which one is more likely to be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that only one of these squares can have a bomb, since both '1's are satisfied by one bomb in either (5,3) or (5,5).\n\nBut I need to confirm that.\n\nIf I place a bomb in (5,3), then (5,4)'s '1' is satisfied, and (6,4)'s '1' is also satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, if I place a bomb in (5,5), both '1's are satisfied.\n\nBut if I place bombs in both (5,3) and (5,5), then (5,4)'s '1' would be overloaded, as it would have two adjacent bombs, but it only shows '1'.\n\nTherefore, only one of these squares can have a bomb.\n\nTherefore, the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nSo, for example, (5,3) or (5,5) has a bomb, and the others are safe.\n\nTherefore, squares like (5,6), (4,5), (4,4), (6,5), etc., are safe to reveal.\n\nWait, but (5,6) is unexplored, and not adjacent to any revealed numbers yet.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n(5,4): '1', with potential bomb in (5,3) or (5,5).\n\n(6,4): '1', same as above.\n\n(5,5): unexplored, adjacent to (5,4)'s '1'.\n\n(5,6): unexplored, adjacent to (5,5).\n\nSo, if I place a bomb in (5,5), then (5,4)'s '1' is satisfied, and (5,6) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I place a bomb in (5,3), then (5,4)'s '1' is satisfied, and (5,5) is safe.\n\nBut I can only have one bomb between (5,3) and (5,5).\n\nTherefore, (5,6) is safe to reveal, because it's only adjacent to (5,5), which can have at most one bomb, but (5,4)'s '1' is already satisfied by the bomb in (5,3) or (5,5).\n\nWait, but (5,6) is adjacent to (5,5), which might have a bomb, but since (5,4)'s '1' is already satisfied by the bomb in (5,5), then (5,6) could still be safe.\n\nBut this is getting a bit too speculative.\n\nMaybe I should consider revealing a square that is safer based on the current information.\n\nLooking back at the top part of the board, perhaps revealing (0,0) could be a safe choice, as it's adjacent to empty spaces.\n\nRow 0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nRow 1: _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n\nRow 2: _ _ _ _ 1 F 1 1 2 .\n\nRow 3: 1 1

is far from there, so perhaps it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, column 0.\n\nRow 6: . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nSo, (6,4) is a '1', and (6,0) is unexplored.\n\nBut (6,0) is not adjacent to any revealed numbers, so it's risky.\n\nMaybe I should try to reveal (0,0).\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the current board state, position (0,0) appears to be a safe choice for revelation, as it is surrounded by unexplored and empty spaces, with no adjacent numbers indicating bombs.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 .

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 5, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see that there are several revealed numbers and some flagged spaces.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the flags that are already placed are correct. Let's check around the flagged spaces to see if they make sense with the adjacent numbers.\n\nLooking at position (1,5), which is flagged as a bomb. Let's see the adjacent numbers:\n\n- To the left is (1,4), which is a '1'.\n\n- Above it is (0,5), which is empty.\n\n- Below it is (2,5), which is a '1'.\n\n- To the right is (1,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally, (0,4) is empty, (0,6) is empty, (2,4) is empty, and (2,6) is a '1'.\n\nSo, the '1's at (1,4), (1,6), and (2,5) all account for this flag at (1,5). That seems consistent. Now, the '1' at (2,5) has this flag adjacent to it, so it shouldn't have any other bombs nearby.\n\nSimilarly, at (2,6), which is a '1', it has the flag at (1,5), which is diagonally adjacent. So, it also shouldn't have any other bombs around it.\n\nNow, looking at (3,5), which is a '1', it's also adjacent to the flag at (1,5). Wait, is (3,5) a '1'? Let's check:\n\nRow 3: 1,1,_,_,1,1,1,_,2,.\n\nSo, position (3,5) is a '1'. It's adjacent to the flag at (1,5). But position (1,5) is two rows above, so it's not directly adjacent. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nActually, position (1,5) is flagged, and position (3,5) is a '1'. Let's see their positions:\n\n- (1,5) is row 1, column 5.\n\n- (3,5) is row 3, column 5.\n\nSo, they are directly above each other, separated by row 2, which has positions (2,5), which is a '1'.\n\nSo, (3,5) is two rows below the flag at (1,5), so they are not directly adjacent. Therefore, the '1' at (3,5) must have a bomb adjacent to it, but not at (1,5).\n\nLooking around (3,5):\n\n- Above it is (2,5), which is a '1'.\n\n- Below it is (4,5), which is unexplored.\n\n- Left is (3,4), which is unexplored.\n\n- Right is (3,6), which is a '1'.\n\n- Diagonally: (2,4), (2,6), (4,4), (4,6), all unexplored except (2,4) is unexplored, (2,6) is a '1'.\n\nSo, the '1' at (3,5) needs one bomb adjacent to it. The possible positions are (3,4), (4,5), (3,6). But (3,6) is a '1', which needs only one bomb adjacent to it. If we place a bomb at (3,4), then both (3,5) and (3,6) are satisfied, as they each have one bomb adjacent.\n\nBut let's see if that makes sense. If I place a bomb at (3,4), then:\n\n- (3,5) has the bomb at (3,4), satisfying its '1'.\n\n- (3,6) has the bomb at (3,4), which is diagonally adjacent, so it counts as one bomb.\n\nBut (3,6) is a '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. Therefore, the other adjacent squares to (3,6) must be safe.\n\nLooking at (3,6):\n\n- Adjacent squares: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7).\n\nBut (2,5) is a '1', (2,6) is a '1', (3,5) is a '1', (3,7) is unexplored, (4,5) is unexplored, (4,6) is unexplored, (4,7) is unexplored.\n\nIf (3,4) is a bomb, then (3,5) and (3,6) are satisfied. Now, (2,5) is a '1', which is adjacent to (1,5) flagged bomb and (3,5), which is a '1'. Wait, no, (2,5) is adjacent to (1,5) flagged, (1,6) '1', (2,6) '1', (3,5) '1', and (3,4) which is possibly a bomb.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the area around (8,6), which is a '2', and (7,5), which is a '2'. There are some unexplored spaces there, and maybe I can deduce something.\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 .\n\nLooking at (7,4), which is unexplored, adjacent to (7,5) '2', and (8,5) unexplored, (8,6) '2', etc.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe I should look for a place where I can safely place a flag or reveal a tile without risking a bomb.\n\nLooking back at the top part of the board, there's a section with multiple '1's and flags. Maybe I can find a safe spot there.\n\nRow 0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nRow 1: _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n\nRow 2: _ _ _ _ 1 F 1 1 2 .\n\nRow 3: 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 2 .\n\nRow 4: . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 5: . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n\nRow 6: . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . 2 _ 1 .\n\nLet's focus on row 0 to row 3.\n\nIn row 0, column 7 is a '1', adjacent to (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9), etc.\n\nBut many of these are unexplored or have flags. This seems too vague.\n\nMaybe I should look for a place with a high certainty of being safe or being a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 6, which is a '2', adjacent to (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7), (9,6).\n\nBut many of these are unexplored. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can look for a place where the number of adjacent bombs is already met, so the rest are safe.\n\nLooking at (1,5) which is flagged, and (1,6) is a '1'. Since (1,5) is flagged, (1,6)'s required bomb is already accounted for, so the rest around (1,6) are safe.\n\nWait, (1,6) is a '1', and it's adjacent to the flagged (1,5), so the '1' is satisfied, meaning no other bombs around it.\n\nSo, the adjacent unexplored spaces to (1,6) can be safely revealed.\n\nLet's see the adjacent unexplored spaces to (1,6):\n\n- (0,5): empty\n\n- (0,6): empty\n\n- (0,7): '1'\n\n- (1,5): flagged\n\n- (1,7): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '1'\n\n- (2,6): '1'\n\n- (2,7): '1'\n\nWait, actually, (0,5) is empty, (0,6) is empty, (0,7) is '1', (1,5) is flagged, (1,7) is '1', (2,5) is '1', (2,6) is '1', (2,7) is '1'.\n\nSo, all adjacent spaces to (1,6) are either revealed or flagged, and the '1' is satisfied by the flagged (1,5). Therefore, I don't need to reveal any more around (1,6).\n\nMaybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet me consider row 3, column 5, which is a '1'.\n\nAdjacent spaces:\n\n- (2,5): '1'\n\n- (2,6): '1'\n\n- (3,4): unexplored\n\n- (3,6): '1'\n\n- (4,5): unexplored\n\nLooking at (3,5)'s '1', it needs one adjacent bomb, which could be at (3,4) or (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, (3,6)'s '1' needs one adjacent bomb, which could be at (3,4) or (4,5).\n\nIf I place a bomb at (3,4), both (3,5) and (3,6) are satisfied.\n\nIf I place a bomb at (4,5), both (3,5) and (3,6) are satisfied.\n\nBut if I place a bomb at (3,4), then (2,5)'s '1' would also have the bomb at (3,4), so it should have only one bomb adjacent, which is at (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, (2,5)'s '1' is adjacent to (1,5) flagged, (1,6) '1', (1,7) '1', (2,6) '1', (3,5) '1', (3,4) possible bomb.\n\nWait, (2,5)'s '1' is already adjacent to the flagged (1,5), so its '1' is satisfied. Therefore, no other bombs can be adjacent to it.\n\nTherefore, (3,4) cannot have a bomb, because that would be adjacent to (2,5), which already has its '1' satisfied by the flagged (1,5).\n\nTherefore, (3,4) must be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) must have a bomb, because (3,5)'s '1' needs one bomb adjacent, and (3,4) is safe.\n\nTherefore, I can place a flag at (4,5).\n\nWait, but let's confirm this.\n\n(3,5)'s '1' needs one bomb adjacent. If (3,4) is safe, then the only option left is (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, (3,6)'s '1' would also point to (4,5) as the bomb.\n\nTherefore, I can safely place a flag at (4,5).\n\nThen, I can reveal (3,4), since it's safe.\n\nBut before doing that, let's see the state of flags.\n\nCurrently, there are 9 flags remaining, but one has already been placed, so perhaps 10 -1 =9 remaining.\n\nWait, no, flags remaining is 9, and bombs are 10, so one bomb is still to be flagged.\n\nTherefore, I can place a flag at (4,5).\n\nThen, reveal (3,4).\n\nBut let's see if there are any other considerations.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5, which is unexplored, and I'm considering placing a flag there.\n\nRow 4: . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nSo, (4,1) is a '1', adjacent to (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,1), (5,2), etc.\n\nBut this seems separate.\n\nSo, placing a flag at (4,5) should be okay.\n\nThen, revealing (3,4) should be safe.\n\nBut let's think again.\n\nIf I place a flag at (4,5), and reveal (3,4), and if my logic is correct, that should be safe.\n\nBut perhaps I should look for another confirmation.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5, which is unexplored, and if I flag it, then (3,5)'s '1' is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6)'s '1' would also have one bomb adjacent, satisfying it.\n\nAnd (4,5)'s flag would also affect (5,5), which is unexplored.\n\nBut (5,5) is adjacent to (4,5), (4,6), (4,4), (5,4), (5,6), (6,5), etc.\n\nThis seems to be opening up another area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4, which is a '1', adjacent to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nIf I place a flag at (4,5), then (5,4)'s '1' would have one bomb adjacent, satisfying it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is unexplored, (5,6) is unexplored.\n\nThis seems okay.\n\nGiven that, I think placing a flag at (4,5) is a safe move, and then revealing (3,4).\n\nBut perhaps for the next move, I'll just place the flag at (4,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the analysis of the numbers and existing flags, placing a flag at (4,5) satisfies the '1' at (3,5) and (3,6), and reveals that (3,4) is safe to reveal.\n\nMOVE: 4,5,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 F 1 1 2 .\n3 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 2 .\n4 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n5 . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n9 . . . . . . 2 _ 1 .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 3, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 8 flags left to place, which means I've already placed 2 flags.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. There are some revealed numbers and some flagged spaces. I need to make sure that the flags I've placed are correct and see if I can deduce where other bombs might be.\n\nLet's start by looking at the flagged space at (1,5). There's a '1' at (0,7), which is adjacent to (1,5). So, if (1,5) is a bomb, then (0,7) has one adjacent bomb, which is satisfied. But I need to check other numbers around here to see if this flag makes sense.\n\nLooking at (1,5), which is flagged, and the '1' at (0,7), which is adjacent to (1,5). So, (0,7) has one adjacent bomb, which is (1,5). That seems okay.\n\nNow, there's a '1' at (3,0) and (3,1), both pointing to one adjacent bomb. Looking around, I see that (2,3) is flagged, but is that related to these '1's?\n\nWait, (2,3) is flagged, and it's adjacent to (1,3), which is unrevealed, and (3,3), which is unrevealed. But (3,0) and (3,1) are adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), and (4,0), (4,1). Hmm, maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at the '2' at (2,8). It's adjacent to (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), and (3,9). Among these, (1,8) is a '1', (1,9) is a '2', (2,7) is a '1', (2,9) is a '2', (3,7) is a '1', (3,8) is a '1', and (3,9) is a '2'. So, no flags around here yet. So, for the '2' at (2,8), there should be two bombs adjacent to it. But none are flagged yet, so there must be two bombs among these adjacent cells.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (3,8), which is a '1', and it's adjacent to (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). Among these, (2,7) is a '1', (2,8) is a '2', (2,9) is a '2', (3,7) is a '1', (3,9) is a '2', (4,7) is a '.', (4,8) is a '.', (4,9) is a '1'. So, for (3,8) to have one adjacent bomb, it must be one of these adjacent cells.\n\nThis seems a bit too vague. Maybe I should look for a place where the number of unknowns equals the number of remaining bombs needed.\n\nLooking at (0,7), which is a '1', and it's adjacent to (0,6), (0,8), (0,9), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7). Among these, (0,6) is '_', (0,8) is '.', (0,9) is '.', (1,6) is '_', (1,7) is '1', (1,8) is '1', (1,9) is '2', (2,7) is '1'. So, only (0,8) and (0,9) are unrevealed. Since (0,7) shows '1', and there are two unrevealed cells, one of them must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is flagged, which is adjacent to (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). Among these, (0,5) is '_', (0,6) is '_', (0,7) is '1', (1,4) is '_', (1,6) is '_', (1,7) is '1', (2,4) is '_', (2,5) is 'F', (2,6) is '_'. So, only (1,4) and (1,6) are unrevealed besides the flagged (2,5). But (1,5) is flagged as a bomb, and (0,7) is adjacent to it, which shows '1', so that's satisfied.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a place where the number of unknowns equals the number of needed bombs.\n\nLooking at (5,4), which is a '1', adjacent to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Among these, (4,3) is '_', (4,4) is 'F', (4,5) is '_', (5,3) is '1', (5,5) is '_', (6,3) is '_', (6,4) is '_', (6,5) is '_'. So, (4,4) is flagged, which is one bomb. The '1' at (5,4) indicates exactly one bomb adjacent, so since (4,4) is already flagged, the other adjacent cells must be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal (5,3), but it's already revealed as '1'. So, perhaps I need to look elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe (6,4), which is adjacent to (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). Among these, (5,3) is '1', (5,4) is '1', (5,5) is '_', (6,3) is '_', (6,4) is '_', (6,5) is '_', (7,3) is '_', (7,4) is '2', (7,5) is '1'. So, for (6,4), which is '_', I need to see if I can deduce anything.\n\nHmm, maybe not immediately.\n\nLet me look at (4,4), which is flagged as a bomb. It's adjacent to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Among these, (3,3) is '_', (3,4) is '_', (3,5) is '1', (4,3) is '_', (4,5) is '_', (5,3) is '1', (5,4) is '1', (5,5) is '_'. So, for the '1' at (5,3), which is adjacent to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Since (4,4) is flagged as a bomb, and (5,3) shows '1', that means there is only one bomb adjacent, which is (4,4). Therefore, the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal (5,2), but it's already revealed as '.'. Similarly, (6,3), (6,4), and (6,5) are all safe.\n\nWait, but (6,4) is '_', which is already revealed. Maybe I need to reveal (6,3).\n\nBut before doing that, let's see if there's a better move.\n\nLooking at (7,4), which is a '2', adjacent to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). Among these, (6,3) is '_', (6,4) is '_', (6,5) is '_', (7,3) is '_', (7,5) is '1', (8,3) is '_', (8,4) is '.', (8,5) is '.'. So, for (7,4) showing '2', and assuming no flags around it, there should be two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nSimilarly, (7,5) is a '1', adjacent to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). Among these, (6,4) is '_', (6,5) is '_', (6,6) is '.', (7,4) is '2', (7,6) is '.', (8,4) is '.', (8,5) is '2', (8,6) is '.'. So, for (7,5) showing '1', there should be one bomb adjacent.\n\nGiven that, and considering (7,4) needs two bombs and (7,5) needs one, but they share (6,4) and (6,5), which are both '_', maybe I can deduce something.\n\nIf I assume that (6,4) is a bomb, then (7,4) would have one bomb accounted for, and (7,5) would have its bomb accounted for if (6,5) is safe.\n\nBut then (7,4) still needs another bomb, which could be (6,5) or one of the others.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me look for a place where the number of unknowns equals the number of needed bombs.\n\nLooking at (0,7), which is '1', with two unknowns adjacent: (0,8) and (0,9). So, one of them must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (1,8), which is '1', adjacent to (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,8), (3,9). Among these, (0,8) and (0,9) are '.', (1,7) is '1', (1,9) is '2', (2,7) is '1', (2,8) is '2', (2,9) is '2', (3,8) is '1', (3,9) is '2'. So, only (0,8) and (0,9) are unknown here.\n\nBut (1,8) shows '1', and it's adjacent to (0,8) and (0,9), which are both '.', so one of them must be a bomb.\n\nBut wait, (0,7) is '1', adjacent to (0,8) and (0,9), so one of them is a bomb. And (1,8) is '1', also adjacent to (0,8) and (0,9), so again, one of them is a bomb.\n\nSo, from (0,7) and (1,8), both point to one bomb between (0,8) and (0,9).\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is adjacent to (0,8), (1,8), and (1,9). (1,9) is '2', which needs two bombs adjacent.\n\nSo, (1,9) is '2', adjacent to (0,9), (1,8), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). But actually, since it's on the edge, fewer adjacents.\n\nWait, in a 10x10 grid, (0,9) is on the top-right corner, so it's adjacent to (0,8), (1,8), (1,9).\n\nSo, (1,9) is '2', adjacent to (0,9), (1,8), (2,9). Now, (1,8) is '1', and (2,9) is '2'.\n\nFrom (1,9) being '2', and adjacent to (0,9), (1,8), (2,9), and (1,8) is '1', which probably has its bomb accounted for by (0,9).\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider that (0,8) and (0,9) are the only two unknowns for both (0,7) and (1,8), and they both indicate one bomb between them.\n\nSo, I can't determine which one is the bomb based on this information alone.\n\nPerhaps I need to look elsewhere on the board.\n\nLooking at (8,6), which is a '2', adjacent to (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). Among these, (7,5) is '1', (7,6) is '.', (7,7) is '.', (8,5) is '2', (8,7) is '.', (9,5) is '.', (9,6) is '.', (9,7) is '.'.\n\nSo, (8,6) is '2', and has several unknowns adjacent. Maybe I can try to place flags here.\n\nBut I don't have enough information yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to reveal a safe cell.\n\nLooking back, perhaps I can reveal (6,3), since earlier I thought that area might be safe.\n\nSo, I'll try to reveal (6,3).\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the analysis around (5,4) and (4,4), which is flagged, I deduced that (6,3) should be safe.\n\nMOVE: 6,3,false", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 F 1 1 2 .\n3 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 2 .\n4 . 1 _ _ _ F _ _ 1 .\n5 . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 _ 1 1\n9 . . . . . . 2 _ 1 .", "sucess": false}
