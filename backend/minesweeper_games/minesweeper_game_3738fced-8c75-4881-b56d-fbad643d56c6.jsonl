{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 3, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "To analyze the current board state and determine the best move, let's break down what we see:\n\n1. **Current Board Status**:\n   - The numbers on the board show adjacent bomb counts that inform flag placement. \n   - We have a total of 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining, so we must be careful with our flag placement.\n   \n2. **Checking Revealed Numbers and Flags**:\n   - **Row 0**: The '1' at (0, 5) indicates one bomb is adjacent. The potential positions are (0, 4), (1, 5), (0, 6), and (1, 6), none of which are flagged.\n   - **Row 1**: The '1's at (1, 2) and (1, 3) and another at (1, 4) all indicate adjacent bombs, with no flags in their vicinity.\n   - **Row 4**: The '1' at (4, 0) has no surrounding flags either, and others on row 4 are similarly not yet flagged.\n\n3. **Identifying Safe Moves**:\n   - The best way to proceed is to reveal tiles that can help us gain information without risking hitting a bomb. \n   - The safe tile to uncover next is (2, 3), which is adjacent to some tiles showing numbers but isn't revealed or flagged yet. This could provide more insight into adjacent bomb counts.\n\n4. **Next Move Decision**:\n   - Since revealing (2, 3) can help recognize where bombs might fit without immediate risk of hitting a bomb, it's sensible to proceed with this tile reveal.\n\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal the tile at (2, 3) to gather more information about adjacent bomb counts. This area is currently unexplored and could help in identifying next steps without the risk of hitting a bomb. \n\nMOVE: 2,3,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . . .\n2 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n4 1 1 1 . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
