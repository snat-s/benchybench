{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nLet me analyze the current Minesweeper board to make a safe move. I'll work methodically through the revealed numbers and see what we can deduce.\n\nFirst, let's look at the current revealed numbers and see if we can identify any squares that definitely contain mines or are definitely safe.\n\nStarting at the bottom right area where we have a line of 1's at (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), and (9,8):\n- Each of these 1's indicates that there is exactly one bomb in their adjacent 8 squares\n- Since they form a vertical line, and there are no other revealed numbers nearby, we know that there must be bombs to the right of some (or all) of these 1's\n- But we can't yet determine with certainty which specific squares contain bombs\n\nMoving to the center-right area with the 2 at (5,6) and 1's at (4,6), (5,7), and (5,8):\n- The 2 at (5,6) indicates two bombs in adjacent squares\n- The 1 at (4,6) indicates one bomb in adjacent squares\n- The 1 at (5,7) indicates one bomb in adjacent squares\n- The 1 at (5,8) indicates one bomb in adjacent squares\n\nNow let's look at the center-left area with the 2's at (5,3) and (5,4):\n- The 2 at (5,3) indicates two bombs in adjacent squares\n- The 2 at (5,4) indicates two bombs in adjacent squares\n\nThe area in the top-left with 1's at (3,2), (3,3), and (3,4), and various numbers in row 4:\n- The 1 at (4,0) and 1 at (4,1) indicate bombs likely in row 5\n- The 2 at (4,2) touches both (5,1) and (5,2) which are unexplored, so one or both might have bombs\n\nLet me systematically check each numbered tile to see if I can make any definitive deductions:\n\nStarting with the 1 at (4,0):\n- Adjacent unexplored: (5,0), (5,1)\n- Since it's a 1, exactly one of these must contain a bomb\n\nThe 1 at (4,1):\n- Adjacent unexplored: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)\n- Since it's a 1, exactly one of these must contain a bomb\n\nThe 2 at (4,2):\n- Adjacent unexplored: (5,1), (5,2)\n- Since it's a 2, both (5,1) and (5,2) must contain bombs\n\nWait, I need to double-check this. If both (5,1) and (5,2) have bombs:\n- The 1 at (4,1) sees bombs at (5,1) and (5,2), which would be 2 bombs, contradicting the \"1\" label\n- So not both (5,1) and (5,2) can have bombs\n\nLet me think differently. The 2 at (4,2) is adjacent to:\n- Known safe: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3)\n- Unexplored: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n- So out of (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3), exactly 2 must have bombs\n\nThe 2 at (5,3) is adjacent to:\n- Known safe: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n- Unexplored: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n- So out of (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), exactly 2 must have bombs\n\nNow, combining these constraints:\n- The 2 at (4,2) needs 2 bombs among (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n- The 2 at (5,3) needs 2 bombs among (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n- If (5,2) has a bomb, the 2 at (4,2) needs one more bomb from (5,1) or (5,3)\n- If (5,2) doesn't have a bomb, the 2 at (4,2) needs bombs at both (5,1) and (5,3)\n\nLet's continue with the 2 at (5,4):\n- Adjacent unexplored: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n- So out of (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), exactly 2 must have bombs\n\nThe 1 at (4,4):\n- Adjacent unexplored: (5,3), (5,5)\n- So out of (5,3), (5,5), exactly 1 must have a bomb\n\nThe 1 at (4,5):\n- Adjacent unexplored: (5,5), (5,6)\n- So out of (5,5), (5,6), exactly 1 must have a bomb\n\nThe 1 at (4,6):\n- Adjacent unexplored: (5,5), (5,6)\n- So out of (5,5), (5,6), exactly 1 must have a bomb\n\nSince both (4,5) and (4,6) each need exactly 1 bomb from (5,5) and (5,6), and they overlap on the same two cells, we don't yet know which one has the bomb.\n\nLet's start making some concrete deductions:\n\n1. From the 2 at (4,2) and the constraints from nearby numbers, we know that at least one of (5,1) or (5,2) must contain a bomb.\n\n2. The 1 at (4,1) sees the same unexplored cells as the 1 at (4,0), which means one bomb is in the set {(5,0), (5,1), (5,2)}.\n\n3. Since we haven't placed any flags yet and have 10 bombs total, we need to be careful.\n\nNow, let's look at the top part of the board:\n- We have 1's at (3,2), (3,3), and (3,4)\n- The 1 at (3,2) is adjacent to unexplored (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n- The 1 at (3,3) is adjacent to unexplored (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n- The 1 at (3,4) is adjacent to unexplored (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n\nSince (4,5) is a 1 and is adjacent to unexplored (5,5) and (5,6), one of those must have a bomb.\n\nI'm going to focus on making a safe move.\n\nLooking at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), we can see that these 1's all share adjacent unexplored cells. Given their pattern and the fact that they're all 1's, it's likely that there's a bomb in one of the shared cells in row 2.\n\nLet's analyze one area in detail. Looking at the numbers in rows 4-5, columns 2-6:\n- The 2 at (4,2) needs 2 bombs among (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n- The 0 at (4,3) (which isn't marked but implied) means no bombs there\n- The 2 at (4,4) needs 2 bombs among adjacent unexplored\n- The 1 at (4,5) needs 1 bomb among (5,5), (5,6)\n- The 1 at (4,6) needs 1 bomb among (5,5), (5,6)\n\nSince both (4,5) and (4,6) need exactly 1 bomb from the same two cells, one of (5,5) or (5,6) must contain a bomb.\n\nLet's look at the 2 at (5,3) more closely:\n- Adjacent to (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n- Of those, (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) are revealed and safe\n- So the 2 bombs must be among (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nLet's check the 2 at (5,4):\n- Adjacent to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n- Of those, (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3) are revealed and safe\n- So the 2 bombs must be among (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nThe 1 at (5,7):\n- Adjacent to (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)\n- Of those, (4,6), (5,8) are revealed and safe\n- So the 1 bomb must be among (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)\n\nThe 1 at (5,8):\n- Adjacent to (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)\n- Of those, (5,7) is revealed and safe\n- So the 1 bomb must be among (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)\n\nOne approach would be to look for unexplored squares that are definitely safe. For example, (0,0) is far from any revealed numbers and could be a good place to click.\n\nHowever, I'm going to be more strategic. From the analysis above, I think there are definitely bombs at some positions, but no position is absolutely guaranteed to be bomb-free yet.\n\nI think the safest move might be to reveal an unexplored square that's far from any current numbers, like (0,0), (0,9), or similar, as they're less likely to contain bombs.\n\nLet me go with (0,0) as my move:\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the board carefully, I can see several important patterns:\n\n1. In the top-left area (row 4, columns 0-2):\n   - The 1 at (4,0) indicates one bomb among (5,0) and (5,1)\n   - The 1 at (4,1) indicates one bomb among (5,0), (5,1), and (5,2)\n   - The 2 at (4,2) indicates two bombs among (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3)\n\n2. In the center-right area:\n   - The 2 at (5,6) with adjacent 1's at (4,6), (5,7), and (5,8) creates a constrained pattern\n\n3. Looking at the bottom-right corner, there's a vertical line of 1's at (6,8) through (9,8), suggesting bombs to their right\n\nBased on probability, I'm choosing to reveal a square in the top-left corner, far from any revealed numbers. This area is likely to be safer since we haven't uncovered any patterns there yet, and there are only 10 bombs in a 10x10 board.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a square in the top-left corner, far from any current revealed numbers, which statistically has a lower chance of containing a bomb.\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n4 1 1 2 . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n5 . . . 2 2 . 2 1 1 _\n6 . . . . . . . . 1 _\n7 . . . . . . . . 1 _\n8 . . . . . . . . 1 _\n9 . . . . . . . . 1 _", "sucess": true}
