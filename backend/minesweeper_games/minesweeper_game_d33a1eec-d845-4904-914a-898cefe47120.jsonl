This means one of the unexplored squares is a bomb. The tiles at (1,0) and (0,0) are both adjacent to squares indicated by the number '1'.

This also indicates one adjacent bomb.\n- The '2' at (1,3) has two potential adjacent flagged cells (1,2) and (2,1). Since it is adjacent to the flagged and each of those positions has a remaining bomb to account for, this aligns with the number.\n- The '2' at (1,4) has its adjacent flagged cell (1,3) and requires one more bomb adjacent which still aligns with the count.\n- The '2' at (2,1) already has a flag at (2,0), so it requires one more flag which still aligns with the count.\n\nBased on these evaluations:\n- There is no current conflict with the flagged positions. \n- We have 9 flags remaining and 10 bombs total, meaning each number on the board must be carefully checked.\n\nNext, I notice the unexplored tile at (2,2) seems reasonable to reveal, as it is surrounded by numbers and does not have any direct conflicts.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing the square at (2,2) might give us more information about bomb placement without conflicting with current flagged squares.\nMOVE: 2,2,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n1 _ 1 1 2 2 . . . . .\n2 F 2 . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
