Since (3,2) already has '1' revealed next to it, the bomb must be at (3,3). \n   - This is supported by the rules, where any neighboring number '1' with one adjacent unexplored space likely indicates a bomb.\n\n2. **Investigate (4,8):**\n   - The tile at (4,8) also shows '1' and only has one unexplored (4,9) neighbor. This suggests a bomb should be flagged there.\n   \n3. **Inspect around (3,4) and (3,5):**\n   - Both positions (3,4) and (3,5) are indicated by number '1's, which means only one bomb could be adjacent.\n   - The adjacent unexplored spaces needed consideration are consumed if (3,3) is flagged, revealing others might be safer.\n   \n4. **Consider (6,0):**\n   - The tile at (6,0) is '1' with an unexplored neighbor at (7,0).

Since (3, 3) already has a flag, other potential bomb locations for these numbers would be adjacent unexplored tiles (3, 5) and (3, 7).
