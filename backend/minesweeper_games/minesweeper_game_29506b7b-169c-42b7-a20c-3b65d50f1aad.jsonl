For example, around the '1's at (1, 6), (1, 7), and (1, 8), there's already an adjacent empty cell which is flagged or known which doesn't present a conflict.\n   - We also have a '2' at (4, 4) which currently has only one adjacent explored square. It may thus require more than one flag.\n\n2. **Potential conflicts**:\n   - Even though there are no current visible conflicts with the numbers and existing flags, we need to keep an eye on the cell at (4, 4), which has potential neighboring bombs.\n   - The '4' at (5, 5) suggests there are four bombs around it, and it currently borders various potential unexplored spaces.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Noticing that the square (4, 4) currently has only one adjacent flag (which is at (4, 3)), it will require one more flag. The cells around (4, 4) that could potentially hold flags are (4, 5), (5, 4), and (3, 4). \n   - The least risky initial move is to reveal an adjacent cell that has a number and is not at risk of finding a bomb.\n\nGiven these, I'll reveal the unexplored cell (4, 5):\n\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal the cell at (4, 5), as it is adjacent to the revealed '2' at (4, 4), and it helps to explore potentially safe areas without risking a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 4,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _\n3 _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1 _\n4 _ _ _ 1 2 . 1 _ 1 1\n5 _ _ _ 2 . 4 2 1 2 .\n6 _ _ _ 2 . . . . . .\n7 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n8 _ _ 1 1 . . . . . .\n9 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
