{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs, and I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after making this move, the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '3'. That means there are 3 bombs adjacent to this cell. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nSince it's my first move and I have no other information, I should flag the cells that are likely to be bombs based on this number. But I need to be careful not to overflag or underflag.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total, I need to use them wisely. Each flag I place should be as accurate as possible.\n\nLet's say I decide to flag three cells adjacent to the '3'. But which three? I need to look at the board and see if any of these adjacent cells are already revealed or have numbers that can give me more information.\n\nAssuming that no other cells are revealed yet, I can choose to flag any three of the eight adjacent cells. For now, I'll choose to flag (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5).\n\nSo, my next moves would be:\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\n\nMOVE: 3,4,true\n\nMOVE: 4,3,true\n\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged three cells, and I have 7 flags left. Next, I should reveal another cell that is not adjacent to the initial reveal to try to expand the board further.\n\nLet's choose (6,6) as another safe starting point.\n\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\n\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\nSuppose this reveals a '1'. Now, there is only one bomb adjacent to (6,6). The adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nI need to see if any of these are already flagged or revealed. Assuming none are flagged yet, I'll flag one of them, say (6,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\n\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged four cells, and I have 6 flags left.\n\nContinuing this process, I need to look for more numbers and adjust my flags accordingly. If I reveal a cell and it shows a '0', that means there are no bombs adjacent to it, and the game should automatically reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nLet's say I reveal (5,4) and it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nI already have flags on (4,3), (4,5), and (6,5). So, out of the eight adjacent cells to (5,4), three are flagged. The number '2' means only two of them are bombs. This suggests that one of the flagged cells is not a bomb, which is a conflict.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If '2' means exactly two adjacent bombs, and I have three flags on adjacent cells, then one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. Therefore, I need to remove one flag from the adjacent cells of (5,4).\n\nSo, I need to unflag one of the cells: (4,3), (4,5), or (6,5). But I need to choose wisely.\n\nLooking at the board, if I unflag (6,5), and assuming that (6,5) is not a bomb, then the '1' at (6,6) would still need one flag, so maybe (6,7) should be flagged.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (3,3). Suppose it shows a '1'. Adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nI have a flag on (3,4) and (4,3). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (3,3). But the '1' indicates only one adjacent bomb. Therefore, one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. So, I need to unflag one of them.\n\nThis suggests that either (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb. But earlier, based on the '3' at (4,4), I flagged (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5). Now, if one of (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb, then perhaps (4,5) is the actual bomb.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (5,5). Suppose it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nI have flags on (4,5) and (6,5). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (5,5). The '2' means exactly two bombs adjacent, so the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (4,6), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,6) safely.\n\nLet's reveal (4,6). Suppose it shows a '0'. Then, the game should auto-reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nNow, the board has expanded in that area, giving me more information.\n\nContinuing this process, revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers, I can progress through the game.\n\nIt's important to keep track of the number of flags left and the number of potential bombs still to be flagged.\n\nAlso, sometimes, I might need to make educated guesses when there isn't enough information to be certain, but that can be risky.\n\nIn summary, my strategy is to:\n\n1. Make initial safe moves to start revealing the board.\n\n2. Flag cells based on the numbers revealed, ensuring that the number of flags matches the numbers.\n\n3. Reveal cells that are likely safe based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\n4. Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n5. Continue this process until all bombs are flagged or all safe cells are revealed.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this Minesweeper problem, we need to methodically reveal safe cells and flag bombs based on the numbers revealed, which indicate how many bombs are adjacent to each cell. Here is a step-by-step approach to playing the game:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - The first move is safe, so choose a central cell to maximize the area revealed.\n   - Based on the number revealed, flag the appropriate number of adjacent cells as bombs.\n\n2. **Expand the Board**:\n   - Choose another safe cell away from the initial move to further expand the revealed area.\n   - Continue flagging cells based on the numbers revealed.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If a number indicates fewer bombs than the flags placed, remove flags accordingly.\n   - Ensure that the number of flags around each numbered cell matches the number shown.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n6. **Completion**:\n   - The game is won by either revealing all safe cells or correctly flagging all bombs.\n\n### Solution Code Structure\n\nSince Minesweeper is an interactive problem, the solution involves a series of moves based on the board's state, which is updated after each move. Therefore, the solution is presented as a sequence of moves with explanations.\n\n### Example Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\n# Move 1: Initial safe move at center\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '3'\n# Flag three adjacent cells\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\nMOVE: 3,4,true\nMOVE: 4,3,true\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\n# Move 2: Another safe move away from initial reveal\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '1'\n# Flag one adjacent cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\n# Move 3: Reveal a new cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another cell to get more information.\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '2'\n# Adjust flags based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Adjust flags around '2' at (5,4).\n# If conflict, unflag one cell\nMOVE: 4,5,false  # Unflag if necessary\n\n# Move 4: Reveal a safe cell based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a safe cell adjacent to '2'.\nMOVE: 4,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '0'\n# Auto-reveal neighbors\nEXPLANATION: '0' at (4,6), auto-revealing neighbors.\n\n# Continue this process until the game is solved.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - Start with a safe move at the center to maximize reveal.\n   - Flag adjacent cells based on the number revealed.\n\n2. **Expanding the Board**:\n   - Make another safe move away from the initial reveal to get more information.\n   - Flag cells accordingly based on new revelations.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If flags exceed the number indicated, remove flags from likely safe cells.\n   - Ensure consistency between flags and numbers.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust strategy as new information is revealed to avoid conflicts and progress towards solving the board.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 9, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. It's a 10x10 grid with 10 bombs left to find, and I have 10 flags remaining. I need to be careful because revealing a bomb ends the game. My goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. There are numbers indicating how many bombs are adjacent to each square, and there are unexplored squares marked with dots. I need to use the numbers to deduce where the bombs are likely to be.\n\nLet's start by looking for any obvious patterns or areas where I can safely place flags or reveal squares.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n0: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nColumn 2 has a '1', which means there is one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). But since some of these are unexplored or have other numbers, I need to see if there are any flags already there.\n\nWait, actually, let's look at the entire board to see if there are any areas with multiple numbers that can help me deduce the positions of bombs.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n1: . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n\nHere, column 2 has a '1', column 4 has a '1', column 5 has a '1', column 6 has a '1', and columns 8 and 9 have '1's.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for areas with higher numbers, like '2's or '3's, because they can give me more specific information.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n2: . . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n\nHere, column 2 has a '2', column 3 has a '1', column 4 has a '2', column 6 has a '1'.\n\nThis suggests that around these numbers, there should be specific numbers of bombs.\n\nLet's try to focus on row 2, column 2, which has a '2'. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nI need to see what's in these squares to see how many are already flagged or revealed.\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (1,1): dot (unexplored)\n\n- (1,2): dot (unexplored)\n\n- (1,3): dot (unexplored)\n\n- (2,1): dot (unexplored)\n\n- (2,3): dot (unexplored)\n\n- (3,1): dot (unexplored)\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\n- (3,3): dot (unexplored)\n\nWait, actually, looking back at row 3:\n\n3: 1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n\nSo, (3,0): '1', (3,1): '1', (3,2): '2', (3,3): dot, (3,4): '3', etc.\n\nWait, so (3,2) is '2', not '1'. My bad.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nFrom row 3:\n\n- (3,0): '1'\n\n- (3,1): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '2'\n\n- (3,3): dot\n\n- (3,4): '3'\n\n- (3,5): '1'\n\n- (3,6): '1'\n\n- (3,7): dot\n\n- (3,8): dot\n\n- (3,9): dot\n\nSo, for row 2, column 2 ('2'), the adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,1): dot\n\n- (1,2): dot\n\n- (1,3): dot\n\n- (2,1): dot\n\n- (2,3): dot\n\n- (3,1): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '2'\n\n- (3,3): dot\n\nCurrently, none of these are flagged, and some are unexplored.\n\nSince the '2' needs exactly two bombs adjacent to it, and none are flagged yet, that means two of these adjacent unexplored squares have bombs.\n\nBut looking at (3,2): '2', which shares some adjacent squares with (2,2): '2'.\n\nThis might be a interconnected area, and I need to consider both numbers together.\n\nLet's look at row 3, column 2 ('2').\n\nIts adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (2,1): dot\n\n- (2,2): '2' (from row 2, column 2)\n\n- (2,3): dot\n\n- (3,1): '1'\n\n- (3,3): dot\n\n- (4,1): dot\n\n- (4,2): dot\n\n- (4,3): dot\n\nSo, for (3,2): '2', it needs exactly two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut (2,2) is a '2', which is already considered.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should look for areas where the number of unflagged possible bomb squares matches the number needed.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has only one unflagged adjacent square, that square must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, if a '2' has exactly two unflagged adjacent squares, they must both be bombs.\n\nLet me scan the board for such scenarios.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 2: '1'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nAll of these are dots, meaning unexplored.\n\nSo, one of these five squares has a bomb.\n\nBut since it's a '1', only one of them is a bomb.\n\nBut without more information, I can't pinpoint which one.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 2: '1'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\nBut (0,2) is a '1' from row 0, column 2.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look at higher numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4: '3'\n\nThis might be more helpful.\n\nRow 3, column 4: '3'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (2,3): dot\n\n- (2,4): '2'\n\n- (2,5): dot\n\n- (3,3): dot\n\n- (3,5): '1'\n\n- (4,3): dot\n\n- (4,4): dot\n\n- (4,5): dot\n\nSo, the '3' needs exactly three bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut none of these are flagged yet.\n\nSo, three of these adjacent squares have bombs.\n\nBut I need to see if there are any squares that are only adjacent to this '3' and no other numbers, which could help me determine where the bombs are.\n\nLooking at these adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,3): dot\n\n- (2,4): '2'\n\n- (2,5): dot\n\n- (3,3): dot\n\n- (3,5): '1'\n\n- (4,3): dot\n\n- (4,4): dot\n\n- (4,5): dot\n\nAmong these, (2,4): '2' and (3,5): '1' are numbers, so they probably have their own bomb requirements.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the '2' in row 2, column 4.\n\nRow 2, column 4: '2'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (1,3): dot\n\n- (1,4): '1'\n\n- (1,5): '1'\n\n- (2,3): dot\n\n- (2,5): dot\n\n- (3,3): dot\n\n- (3,4): '3'\n\n- (3,5): '1'\n\nSo, the '2' needs exactly two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut again, multiple numbers are involved here.\n\nThis seems too interconnected to make a safe move.\n\nMaybe I should look at the bottom part of the board.\n\nLooking at row 7:\n\n7: _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 8:\n\n8: 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n\nRow 9:\n\n9: . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nHere, row 7, column 2: '1'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (6,1): dot\n\n- (6,2): dot\n\n- (6,3): '1'\n\n- (7,1): dot\n\n- (7,3): '1'\n\n- (8,1): '1'\n\n- (8,2): '1'\n\n- (8,3): dot\n\nSo, the '1' in (7,2) needs exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut looking at the adjacent squares, some of them are '1's themselves, which complicates things.\n\nThis seems too vague to make a decision.\n\nMaybe I should look for squares that are only adjacent to one number, making it clear whether they are safe or not.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has only one unflagged adjacent square, that square must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, if a '1' has two unflagged adjacent squares and one flagged square, the remaining two must be safe.\n\nWait, let's look for such scenarios.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 8: '1'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (4,7): dot\n\n- (4,8): dot\n\n- (4,9): '1'\n\n- (5,7): dot\n\n- (5,9): '1'\n\n- (6,7): dot\n\n- (6,8): dot\n\n- (6,9): dot\n\nSo, the '1' in (5,8) needs exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut none are flagged yet, and all are unexplored except (4,9) and (5,9), which are '1's.\n\nWait, (4,9) is a '1', and (5,9) is a '1'.\n\nSo, their adjacent squares need to be considered.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, and see if I can deduce its status based on those numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total number of flags left and see if there are areas where I can safely place flags.\n\nI have 10 flags left, and there are 10 bombs remaining.\n\nSo, every flag should correspond to a bomb.\n\nI need to make sure that the flags I place don't contradict the numbers on the board.\n\nLet me try to look for a square that must be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4: '3'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (2,3): dot\n\n- (2,4): '2'\n\n- (2,5): dot\n\n- (3,3): dot\n\n- (3,5): '1'\n\n- (4,3): dot\n\n- (4,4): dot\n\n- (4,5): dot\n\nSo, the '3' needs three bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut (2,4) is a '2', which needs two bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nLet's list the adjacent squares for both:\n\nFor (3,4): '3' -> squares: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nFor (2,4): '2' -> squares: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nThe overlapping squares are: (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5)\n\nSo, these squares are adjacent to both numbers.\n\nLet me see how many bombs are needed in these overlapping squares.\n\nFrom (3,4): '3' needs three bombs in its eight adjacent squares.\n\nFrom (2,4): '2' needs two bombs in its eight adjacent squares.\n\nBut the overlapping squares are four: (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5)\n\nAssuming that the bombs are only in these overlapping squares, which is not necessarily the case, but let's see.\n\nIf all three bombs for (3,4) are in these four overlapping squares, and two bombs for (2,4) are in these four overlapping squares, then there must be at least two bombs in these four squares to satisfy both conditions.\n\nBut (3,4): '3' needs three bombs, so if two are in the overlapping squares, the third must be in one of the non-overlapping squares: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nBut (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are all dots, unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4): '2' needs two bombs, and if two are in the overlapping squares, that satisfies its condition.\n\nBut (3,4): '3' needs three bombs, so if two are in the overlapping squares, one must be in (4,3), (4,4), or (4,5)\n\nBut I don't have enough information yet.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for me to deduce anything confidently.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I can look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, and see if I can determine whether it's a bomb or not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is only adjacent to one number, making it easier to determine its status.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0: dot\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (0,1): dot\n\n- (0,2): '1'\n\n- (1,0): dot\n\n- (1,1): dot\n\n- (1,2): dot\n\nSo, (0,0) is adjacent to one '1' and four dots.\n\nThe '1' in (0,2) needs one bomb in its adjacent squares, which include (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nSo, if I flag (0,1) as a bomb, would that satisfy the '1' in (0,2)?\n\nBut (0,1) is adjacent to (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n\nIf I flag (0,1), then the '1' in (0,2) would have its required bomb, but I need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nBut looking at (0,0), which is adjacent to (0,1), if (0,1) is a bomb, then (0,0) is safe to reveal.\n\nBut I need to make sure that flagging (0,1) doesn't create conflicts with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (1,1), which is adjacent to (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nBut (1,1) is a dot, unexplored.\n\nThis seems too uncertain.\n\nMaybe I should consider the top-right corner.\n\nRow 0, column 9: dot\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (1,9), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (0,8): '1'\n\n- (0,9): dot\n\n- (1,8): '1'\n\n- (1,9): '1'\n\n- (2,8): dot\n\n- (2,9): dot\n\nSo, (0,9) is adjacent to (0,8): '1', (1,8): '1', and (1,9): '1'\n\nThis seems like a promising area because multiple '1's are involved.\n\nLet's see the adjacent squares for (0,8): '1'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (0,7): dot\n\n- (0,8): '1'\n\n- (0,9): dot\n\n- (1,7): dot\n\n- (1,8): '1'\n\n- (1,9): '1'\n\nSo, (0,8): '1' needs one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (1,8): '1' needs one bomb in its adjacent squares:\n\n- (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nAnd (1,9): '1' needs one bomb in its adjacent squares:\n\n- (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (1,10) [out of bounds], (2,8), (2,9)\n\nWait, column 10 doesn't exist, so only adjacent squares are (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nSo, for (1,9): '1', adjacent squares are (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nNow, looking at these overlapping squares, perhaps I can find a square that must be a bomb or must be safe.\n\nLet me consider the possible bomb placements in this area.\n\nLet's list the adjacent squares for each of the '1's:\n\n- (0,8): '1' -> adjacent squares: (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)\n\n- (1,8): '1' -> adjacent squares: (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n\n- (1,9): '1' -> adjacent squares: (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nNow, looking for a square that is common to all or to a combination that can satisfy the '1's.\n\nThis seems too convoluted. Maybe I should consider that since each '1' needs exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares, and some squares are adjacent to multiple '1's, I can try to find a configuration where each '1' has exactly one bomb in its adjacent area without overlapping incorrectly.\n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming, and I need to make a move soon.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the bottom part of the board again.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 8: '1'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (7,7): dot\n\n- (7,8): '1'\n\n- (7,9): dot\n\n- (8,7): dot\n\n- (8,9): dot\n\n- (9,7): dot\n\n- (9,8): '1'\n\n- (9,9): dot\n\nSo, (8,8): '1' needs exactly one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (7,8): '1' needs one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\n(9,8): '1' needs one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nThis seems similar to the top-right corner situation.\n\nAgain, multiple '1's interacting in a way that's hard to resolve without more information.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that's adjacent only to higher numbers, which might make it easier to determine its status.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4: '3'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (2,3): dot\n\n- (2,4): '2'\n\n- (2,5): dot\n\n- (3,3): dot\n\n- (3,5): '1'\n\n- (4,3): dot\n\n- (4,4): dot\n\n- (4,5): dot\n\nSo, (3,4): '3' needs three bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut (2,4): '2' needs two bombs in its adjacent squares, which include some of the same squares.\n\nThis seems too interconnected again.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possibility of multiple bombs in certain areas.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the total number of bombs needed in a certain area based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, (3,4): '3' needs three bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\n(2,4): '2' needs two bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nThe overlapping adjacent squares are: (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5)\n\nSo, if I assume that two bombs are in the overlapping squares to satisfy (2,4): '2', then (3,4): '3' would need one additional bomb in its non-overlapping squares: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo, perhaps I can flag one of (4,3), (4,4), or (4,5) as a bomb.\n\nBut I need to verify if that aligns with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (4,3): dot\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (3,2): '2'\n\n- (3,3): dot\n\n- (3,4): '3'\n\n- (4,2): dot\n\n- (4,4): dot\n\n- (4,5): dot\n\n- (5,2): dot\n\n- (5,3): dot\n\n- (5,4): dot\n\nSo, (4,3) is adjacent to (3,4): '3', which needs one more bomb in (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nIf I flag (4,3), does that satisfy (3,4): '3'?\n\nBut I need to check if flagging (4,3) affects other numbers.\n\nLooking at (3,4): '3', if I flag (4,3), that would account for one bomb, meaning two more bombs need to be in the remaining adjacent squares: (4,4), (4,5)\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine that.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider that (4,3) is a bomb, and see if that creates any conflicts with other numbers.\n\nIf I flag (4,3), then (3,4): '3' would have one bomb accounted for, needing two more in (4,4), (4,5), and possibly others.\n\nBut (4,4) and (4,5) are both dots, unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is adjacent to (4,4) and (4,5), which are both dots.\n\nThis doesn't give me enough information to proceed confidently.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nMaybe I can look for a row or column that has a specific number of bombs accounted for, allowing me to deduce the positions of remaining bombs.\n\nBut given the board's current state, I don't see any rows or columns where the number of bombs is clearly defined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total number of flags left and see if there are areas where I can safely place multiple flags.\n\nBut with 10 flags left and multiple areas that could potentially have bombs, I need to be careful not to place flags incorrectly.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a square that, if revealed, wouldn't cause me to lose the game, based on the numbers around it.\n\nFor example, if I can determine that a particular square is safe to reveal because it's not a bomb, I can reveal it to get more information.\n\nLooking back at the top-left corner:\n\nRow 0, column 0: dot\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (0,1): dot\n\n- (0,2): '1'\n\n- (1,0): dot\n\n- (1,1): dot\n\n- (1,2): dot\n\nIf I reveal (0,0), and if it's a bomb, I lose the game.\n\nBut if it's safe, I can get more information.\n\nHowever, without more certainty, I shouldn't risk revealing a potentially dangerous square.\n\nPerhaps I should consider flagging a square that seems likely to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking back at row 0, column 1: dot\n\nAdjacent to (0,0): dot and (0,2): '1'\n\nIf I flag (0,1), would that satisfy the '1' in (0,2)?\n\nBut (0,2): '1' has adjacent squares: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nIf I flag (0,1), that would account for the '1's requirement, assuming no other bombs are adjacent.\n\nBut (0,2): '1' would have only (0,1) as a bomb, which is fine.\n\nBut I need to ensure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (1,2): dot\n\nAdjacent to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\nIf (0,1) is a bomb, then (1,2) is adjacent to one bomb, satisfying any '1's it might be adjacent to.\n\nBut I need to check all related numbers.\n\nThis is getting too involved, and I'm not making progress.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the '1's in the top-right corner are indicating single bombs, and try to place flags accordingly.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8: '1'\n\nAdjacent squares: (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- (0,7): dot\n\n- (0,8): '1'\n\n- (0,9): dot\n\n- (1,7): dot\n\n- (1,8): '1'\n\n- (1,9): '1'\n\nSimilarly, (1,8): '1' has adjacent squares: (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nAnd (1,9): '1' has adjacent squares: (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nSo, the overlapping squares are: (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (1,9)\n\nIf I flag (0,9), that would satisfy the '1' in (0,8), assuming no other bombs are adjacent.\n\nBut (1,8): '1' would still need its bomb, which could be in (1,9) or another square.\n\nThis seems messy.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that (0,9) is a bomb, flag it, and see if that satisfies the '1's.\n\nIf I flag (0,9), then:\n\n- (0,8): '1' has one adjacent flag, so it's satisfied.\n\n- (1,8): '1' has one adjacent flag, so it's satisfied.\n\n- (1,9): '1' has one adjacent flag, so it's satisfied.\n\nWait, does (1,9): '1' have only one adjacent flag if I flag (0,9)?\n\nActually, (1,9) is adjacent to (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nIf I flag (0,9), then (1,9): '1' has one adjacent flag, which satisfies it.\n\nSo, flagging (0,9) satisfies all three '1's in this area.\n\nThis seems like a plausible move.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no conflicts with other numbers.\n\nLooking further, I don't see any immediate conflicts.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed to flag (0,9).\n\nEXPLANATION: Flagging (0,9) satisfies the '1's in (0,8), (1,8), and (1,9) without creating any conflicts with other

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. I need to be careful and make sure I don't step on any bombs.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the areas where I have some numbers revealed and see if I can deduce anything about the locations of the bombs.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n0: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n\nColumn 2 has a '1', which means there is one bomb adjacent to it. Columns 1 and 3 are adjacent to column 2. Column 1 is unexplored ('.'), column 3 is empty ('_'), and column 4 is unexplored ('.'). So, the bomb must be in either column 1 or column 4 of row 0.\n\nBut wait, column 9 has a '1' and a flag ('F') next to it. So, the flag is probably on column 10, but since the board is 10x10, column 9 is the last column. So, the '1' in column 9 of row 0 must have its bomb in one of the adjacent squares: row -1 (which doesn't exist), row 0 column 8, or row 1 column 9. Since row -1 doesn't exist, and column 8 in row 0 is a '1', which is a number, not a bomb. So, the bomb must be in row 1, column 9.\n\nBut row 1, column 9 is already a '1'. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the flag is on row 1, column 9. Let me check the board again.\n\nWait, in row 0, column 9 is 'F', which is a flag. So, the '1' in row 0, column 8 must have its bomb in row 0, column 9 (which is flagged), or row 1, column 8 or 9.\n\nBut row 0, column 9 is flagged, so that's one bomb. The '1' in column 8 suggests that only one bomb is adjacent, which is already flagged in column 9. So, row 1, column 8 and row 1, column 9 should be safe to click.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n1: . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n\nColumn 2 has a '1'. Adjacent squares are row 0, column 2 (which is '1'), row 0, column 3 ('_'), row 1, column 1 ('.'), row 1, column 3 ('_'), row 2, column 2 ('2'), row 2, column 3 ('1'), row 2, column 1 ('.'), and row 0, column 1 ('.').\n\nWait, no. Adjacent squares to row 1, column 2 are:\n\n- row 0, column 1: '.'\n\n- row 0, column 2: '1'\n\n- row 0, column 3: '_'\n\n- row 1, column 1: '.'\n\n- row 1, column 3: '_'\n\n- row 2, column 1: '.'\n\n- row 2, column 2: '2'\n\n- row 2, column 3: '1'\n\nSo, the '1' in row 1, column 2 indicates that one of these adjacent squares has a bomb. We already have a flag in row 0, column 9, but that's not adjacent here. So, perhaps the bomb is in one of these squares.\n\nBut let's see, row 2, column 2 is '2', which means two bombs adjacent to it. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- row 1, column 1: '.'\n\n- row 1, column 2: '1'\n\n- row 1, column 3: '_'\n\n- row 2, column 1: '.'\n\n- row 2, column 3: '1'\n\n- row 3, column 1: '1'\n\n- row 3, column 2: '2'\n\n- row 3, column 3: '.'\n\nSo, the '2' in row 2, column 2 has two bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent numbers are row 1, column 2 ('1') and row 3, column 2 ('2'), which are numbers, not bombs. So, the bombs must be in some of the unexplored squares around it.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for areas where I can be more certain.\n\nLet's look at row 3:\n\n3: 1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n\nHere, column 4 has a '3', which means three bombs adjacent to it. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- row 2, column 3: '1'\n\n- row 2, column 4: '2'\n\n- row 2, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 3, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 3, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 4, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 4: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, the '3' in row 3, column 4 has three bombs in these adjacent squares. Currently, there are no flags around it, and all adjacent squares except row 2, column 3 and row 2, column 4 are unexplored.\n\nBut row 2, column 3 is '1', which is a number, not a bomb, and row 2, column 4 is '2', which is also a number. So, the three bombs must be in the remaining adjacent unexplored squares: row 2, column 5; row 3, column 3; row 3, column 5; row 4, column 3; row 4, column 4; row 4, column 5.\n\nBut row 3, column 5 is '1', which is a number, so it's not a bomb. So, the three bombs must be among row 2, column 5; row 3, column 3; row 4, column 3; row 4, column 4; row 4, column 5.\n\nWait, but row 3, column 5 is '1', which means only one bomb adjacent to it. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- row 2, column 4: '2'\n\n- row 2, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 2, column 6: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 3, column 4: '3'\n\n- row 3, column 6: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 4: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 6: '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, the '1' in row 3, column 5 has one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent numbers are row 2, column 4 ('2') and row 3, column 4 ('3'), which are numbers, not bombs. So, the bomb must be in one of the unexplored squares around it: row 2, column 5; row 2, column 6; row 4, column 4; row 4, column 5; row 4, column 6; row 3, column 6.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me try to count the total number of unexplored squares and see how many bombs are left.\n\nThe board is 10x10, so 100 squares in total. From the board, I can see that many squares are still unexplored ('.'). Let's count them.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: 7 unexplored squares (columns 0,1,4,5,6,7,8)\n\nRow 1: 2 unexplored squares (columns 0,1)\n\nRow 2: 3 unexplored squares (columns 1,3,4)\n\nRow 3: 2 unexplored squares (columns 3,5)\n\nRow 4: 7 unexplored squares (columns 0,1,2,3,4,5,8)\n\nRow 5: 7 unexplored squares (columns 0,1,2,3,4,7,9)\n\nRow 6: 7 unexplored squares (columns 0,1,2,3,4,7,9)\n\nRow 7: 7 unexplored squares (columns 0,1,2,3,4,7,9)\n\nRow 8: 6 unexplored squares (columns 0,1,3,4,5,7)\n\nRow 9: 7 unexplored squares (columns 0,1,3,4,5,7,9)\n\nTotal unexplored squares: 7+2+3+2+7+7+7+7+6+7 = 55 squares.\n\nThere are 10 bombs in total, and 9 flags remaining, which means 1 bomb has already been flagged.\n\nSo, there are 9 bombs left to find among 55 unexplored squares.\n\nThat's a lot of uncertainty. I need to find a way to safely reveal some squares or place some flags with certainty.\n\nLet me look for squares where the number of adjacent bombs is already met by the existing flags.\n\nFor example, in row 0, column 8 has a '1', and there is a flag in row 0, column 9. So, the '1' is satisfied, meaning that no other adjacent squares are bombs.\n\nThe adjacent squares to row 0, column 8 are:\n\n- row -1, column 7: doesn't exist\n\n- row -1, column 8: doesn't exist\n\n- row -1, column 9: doesn't exist\n\n- row 0, column 7: '.'\n\n- row 0, column 9: flagged\n\n- row 1, column 7: '.'\n\n- row 1, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 1, column 9: '1'\n\nSince the '1' is already satisfied by the flag in row 0, column 9, the other adjacent unexplored squares should be safe to click.\n\nSo, row 0, column 7 and row 1, column 7 and row 1, column 8 can be safely revealed.\n\nBut wait, row 1, column 8 is already a '1', which is a number, not a bomb.\n\nSo, row 0, column 7 and row 1, column 7 can be safely revealed.\n\nLet me choose to reveal row 0, column 7.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The '1' in row 0, column 8 is already satisfied by the flag in row 0, column 9, so the adjacent unflagged squares are safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n1 . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n2 . . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n7 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n8 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n9 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}

So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. I need to be careful and make sure I don't step on any bombs.\n\nFirst, I should look at the numbers and see what they're telling me about the surrounding squares. Numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that square. So, for example, a '1' means there's one bomb in the eight surrounding squares, a '2' means two bombs, and so on up to '8'.\n\nLet's start by looking at the top row:\n\nRow 0:\n\nColumn 2 has a '1', and column 8 has a '1' and an 'F'. So, column 8 has a flagged square, which might be a bomb.\n\nRow 1:\n\nColumn 2 has a '1', column 4 has a '1', column 5 has a '1', column 6 has a '1', and column 8 has a '1' and a '1'. Wait, column 8 has two '1's? That might be a typo; maybe it's '1' and '1' separately.\n\nRow 2:\n\nColumn 2 has a '2', column 3 has '1', column 4 has '2', column 6 has '1'.\n\nRow 3:\n\nColumn 0 has '1', column 1 has '1', column 2 has '2', column 4 has '3', column 5 has '1', column 6 has '1'.\n\nRow 4:\n\nColumn 2 has '2', column 4 has '2'.\n\nRow 5:\n\nColumn 2 has '2', column 4 has '2', column 9 has '1' and '1'.\n\nRow 6:\n\nColumn 2 has '1', column 4 has '1', column 9 has '1' and '.'.\n\nRow 7:\n\nColumn 2 has '1', column 3 has '1', column 4 has '1', column 9 has '1' and '.'.\n\nRow 8:\n\nColumn 0 has '1', column 1 has '1', column 8 has '1', column 9 has '1'.\n\nRow 9:\n\nColumn 1 has '1', column 8 has '1', column 9 has '.'.\n\nOkay, that's a lot to process. Let's try to find some safe moves or places where I can confidently place flags.\n\nLet's look at row 0, column 8. There's a '1' and an 'F'. So, there's one bomb adjacent to this '1', and there's already a flag there. That means the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nWait, let's see: row 0, column 8 has a '1' and an 'F'. The 'F' is likely on one of the adjacent squares. Let's see which squares are adjacent to row 0, column 8.\n\nAdjacent squares to (0,8):\n\n- (0,7)\n\n- (0,9)\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (1,8)\n\n- (1,9)\n\nNow, looking at the board:\n\n- (0,7) is '_'\n\n- (0,8) is '1'\n\n- (0,9) is 'F'\n\n- (1,7) is '_'\n\n- (1,8) is '1'\n\n- (1,9) is '1'\n\nSo, the flagged square is at (0,9). The '1' at (0,8) indicates there's one bomb adjacent to it. Since (0,9) is flagged, that accounts for the one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares should be safe: (0,7), (1,7), and (1,9).\n\nWait, but (1,8) is also a '1', which is adjacent to (0,8). But (1,8) has its own set of adjacent squares.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me look for a place where the number of flags equals the number indicated, and then the remaining squares around it are safe to reveal.\n\nAlternatively, look for a place where the number of unknown squares equals the number needed for the bomb count.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet's look at row 3, column 4. It has a '3'. Let's see the adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\nNow, looking at these:\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '2'\n\n- (2,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (3,3): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (3,5): '1'\n\n- (4,3): '2'\n\n- (4,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (4,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, around the '3', there are some unexplored squares. But I don't see any flags here, so I can't be sure where the bombs are.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a '1' that has only one unflagged adjacent square, meaning that square must be a bomb.\n\nLet's scan for such opportunities.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 2 has a '1'. Adjacent squares:\n\n- (0,1)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,3)\n\nStatus:\n\n- (0,1): '.'\n\n- (0,3): '_'\n\n- (1,1): '.'\n\n- (1,2): '1'\n\n- (1,3): '_'\n\nSo, only (0,1) and (1,1) are unexplored. But there's already a '1' at (1,2), which is adjacent to (0,2). So, only one of these two squares can be a bomb.\n\nBut since the '1' at (0,2) says there's one bomb adjacent, and (0,1) and (1,1) are the only unexplored squares, one of them must be a bomb.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine which one specifically.\n\nLet's look elsewhere.\n\nRow 1, column 2 has a '1'. Adjacent squares:\n\n- (0,1)\n\n- (0,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\nStatus:\n\n- (0,1): '.'\n\n- (0,2): '1'\n\n- (0,3): '_'\n\n- (1,1): '.'\n\n- (1,3): '_'\n\n- (2,1): '.'\n\n- (2,2): '2'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\nSo, the '1' at (1,2) has adjacent unexplored squares at (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1). It says there's one bomb adjacent, so only one of these three is a bomb.\n\nBut I can't pinpoint which one yet.\n\nLet's look for a '2' with two unexplored squares adjacent, meaning both must be bombs.\n\nRow 2, column 2 has a '2'. Adjacent squares:\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (3,3)\n\nStatus:\n\n- (1,1): '.'\n\n- (1,2): '1'\n\n- (1,3): '_'\n\n- (2,1): '.'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (3,1): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '2'\n\n- (3,3): '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, the '2' at (2,2) has adjacent unexplored squares at (1,1), (2,1), and (3,3). It needs two bombs adjacent, so possibly two of these three are bombs.\n\nBut that's not very specific.\n\nWait, maybe I can look for a group of squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers.\n\nLet's consider row 3, column 3. It's '.' (unexplored), and it's adjacent to:\n\n- (2,2): '2'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '2'\n\n- (3,2): '2'\n\n- (3,4): '3'\n\n- (4,2): '2'\n\n- (4,3): '.'\n\n- (4,4): '.'\n\nSo, it's adjacent to several numbered squares. This could be a complex area, better to avoid for now.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a square that's the only possible place for a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLet's look at row 5, column 9. It has a '1' and a '1'. Wait, maybe it's two separate '1's.\n\nLooking back at the board, row 5, column 9 has '1' and '1', perhaps indicating two separate '1's adjacent to each other.\n\nThis might be a mistake in notation; maybe it's two different squares.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a '1' with another '1' next to it.\n\nIn any case, it's confusing. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's consider row 6, column 9. It has a '1' and a '.'.\n\nSo, the '1' at (6,9) has one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (5,9)\n\n- (5,10) \u2013 but column 10 doesn't exist, since columns are 0-9.\n\n- (6,8)\n\n- (6,10) \u2013 again, column 10 doesn't exist.\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (7,9)\n\n- (7,10) \u2013 same.\n\nSo, adjacent squares are (5,8), (5,9), (6,8), (7,8), and (7,9).\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (5,8): '1'\n\n- (5,9): '1'\n\n- (6,8): '1'\n\n- (7,8): '1'\n\n- (7,9): '1'\n\nWait, all of these are either '1's or numbers. Does that mean none of them are bombs?\n\nWait, no. Numbers indicate bombs adjacent to them, not that they are safe themselves.\n\nWait, actually, numbers are always safe to click; they indicate how many bombs are around them.\n\nSo, in this case, all these '1's are safe, but their adjacent squares might have bombs.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider row 6, column 9's '1'. It needs one adjacent bomb. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,8): '1' (safe)\n\n- (5,9): '1' (safe)\n\n- (6,8): '1' (safe)\n\n- (7,8): '1' (safe)\n\n- (7,9): '1' (safe)\n\nWait, but all these are '1's, which are safe. Does that mean the bomb is elsewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the adjacent squares. Let's see:\n\nFor (6,9):\n\n- Above: (5,9)\n\n- Below: (7,9)\n\n- Left: (6,8)\n\n- Right: (6,10) \u2013 out of bounds\n\n- Diagonals: (5,8), (5,10) \u2013 out of bounds, (7,8), (7,10) \u2013 out of bounds\n\nSo, only (5,8), (5,9), (6,8), (7,8), and (7,9) are adjacent.\n\nAll of these are '1's, which are safe. So, if all adjacent squares to (6,9) are '1's, which are safe, then where is the bomb that (6,9) is indicating?\n\nWait, maybe there's a square outside of these that is part of the adjacency.\n\nWait, no, the adjacency is only these eight squares.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the bomb is actually beyond the adjacent squares, but that's not possible because adjacency is only eight surrounding squares.\n\nWait, perhaps the '1' at (6,9) is indicating a bomb at (6,10), but column 10 doesn't exist, so that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in the board representation.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet me try to look for a square where the number of unflagged adjacent squares equals the number needed for bombs.\n\nFor example, if a '2' has two unflagged adjacent squares, then both must be bombs.\n\nLet's look for such scenarios.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 2 has a '2'. Adjacent squares:\n\n- (1,1): '.'\n\n- (1,2): '1'\n\n- (1,3): '_'\n\n- (2,1): '.'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (3,1): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '2'\n\n- (3,3): '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, unflagged adjacent squares are (1,1), (2,1), and (3,3).\n\nThe '2' needs two bombs adjacent to it, so possibly two of these three are bombs.\n\nBut I don't know which ones.\n\nNot enough to make a definitive move.\n\nLet me look at row 3, column 2 has a '2'. Adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,1): '.'\n\n- (2,2): '2'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (3,1): '1'\n\n- (3,3): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (4,1): '2'\n\n- (4,2): '2'\n\n- (4,3): '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, unflagged adjacent squares are (2,1), (3,3), and (4,3).\n\nThe '2' needs two bombs adjacent, so possibly two of these three are bombs.\n\nAgain, not specific enough.\n\nWait, maybe I can look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, and see if the bomb counts make sense.\n\nLet's consider square (2,1), which is '.' (unexplored). It's adjacent to:\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (3,0)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (3,2)\n\nStatus:\n\n- (1,0): '.'\n\n- (1,1): '.'\n\n- (1,2): '1'\n\n- (2,0): '.'\n\n- (2,2): '2'\n\n- (3,0): '1'\n\n- (3,1): '1'\n\n- (3,2): '2'\n\nSo, (2,1) is adjacent to two '2's and two '1's, all of which are safe squares. The '2's and '1's indicate that there are bombs adjacent to them, but since (2,1) is adjacent to these numbers, it might be a bomb needed for their counts.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated for me to figure out right now.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that's probably safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 7 is '_', which is already revealed. Adjacent to it are:\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (0,8)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (1,8)\n\nStatus:\n\n- (0,6): '_'\n\n- (0,8): '1'\n\n- (1,6): '_'\n\n- (1,7): '_'\n\n- (1,8): '1'\n\nSo, (0,7) is safe, and its adjacent squares are mostly revealed, except (0,6) and (1,6), which are already revealed.\n\nWait, no, (0,6) is '_', (0,7) is '_', (0,8) is '1', (1,6) is '_', (1,7) is '_', (1,8) is '1'.\n\nSo, all adjacent squares are either revealed or numbered, meaning no unexplored squares adjacent to (0,7). So, not helpful for finding new safe squares.\n\nLet me look at row 1, column 7. It's '_', which is revealed. Adjacent squares:\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (0,7)\n\n- (0,8)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (1,8)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (2,8)\n\nStatus:\n\n- (0,6): '_'\n\n- (0,7): '_'\n\n- (0,8): '1'\n\n- (1,6): '_'\n\n- (1,7): '_'\n\n- (1,8): '1'\n\n- (2,6): '_'\n\n- (2,7): '.'\n\n- (2,8): '.'\n\nSo, (2,7) and (2,8) are unexplored. The '1' at (0,8) and (1,8) indicate that there's one bomb adjacent to each.\n\nLooking at (1,7), which is '_', and its adjacent squares include (2,7) and (2,8). If I can determine if these are safe or not, I can decide whether to reveal them.\n\nBut I don't have enough information yet.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possibility of placing a flag on one of these squares.\n\nWait, but I have only 9 flags left, and there are 10 bombs in total. So, one bomb is already flagged, which makes sense.\n\nLet me try to count how many unexplored squares are left.\n\nThe board is 10x10, so 100 squares in total. Subtracting the revealed squares:\n\nLooking at the board, count the number of '_' and numbers, which are revealed squares.\n\nRow 0: 3 '.'s, 1 '1', 1 '_', 1 '1', 1 'F' \u2192 3 unexplored, 3 revealed\n\nRow 1: 2 '.'s, 1 '1', 1 '1', 1 '1', 1 '1', 1 '1' \u2192 2 unexplored, 5 revealed\n\nRow 2: 1 '.', 1 '2', 1 '1', 1 '2', 1 '.', 1 '_', 1 '_' \u2192 2 unexplored, 5 revealed\n\nRow 3: 1 '1', 1 '1', 1 '2', 1 '.', 1 '3', 1 '1', 1 '1', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '_' \u2192 3 unexplored, 7 revealed\n\nRow 4: 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '2', 1 '.', 1 '2', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '_' \u2192 1 unexplored, 2 revealed\n\nRow 5: 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '2', 1 '.', 1 '2', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '1', 1 '1' \u2192 2 unexplored, 4 revealed\n\nRow 6: 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '1', 1 '.', 1 '1', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '1', 1 '.' \u2192 2 unexplored, 4 revealed\n\nRow 7: 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '1', 1 '1', 1 '1', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '1', 1 '.' \u2192 2 unexplored, 4 revealed\n\nRow 8: 1 '1', 1 '1', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '1', 1 '1', 1 '1', 1 '.' \u2192 3 unexplored, 5 revealed\n\nRow 9: 1 '.', 1 '1', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '_', 1 '1', 1 '.', 1 '.' \u2192 4 unexplored, 3 revealed\n\nTotal revealed squares: 3+5 + 5 +7 +2 +4 +4 +4 +5 +3 = 40 revealed squares.\n\nTotal unexplored squares: 100 - 40 = 60 squares.\n\nBut wait, that seems too high. Let's recount the unexplored squares based on the board.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\nRow 0: 7 unexplored squares (columns 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9: '.'s and 'F's)\n\nWait, no, the board shows '.' for unexplored, and '_' or numbers for revealed.\n\nWait, the board legend says:\n\n- '_': Empty revealed space\n\n- '.': Unexplored space\n\n- 'F': Flagged space\n\nSo, to count unexplored squares, count all '.'s.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: 3 '.'s (columns 0,1,9)\n\nRow 1: 2 '.'s (columns 0,1)\n\nRow 2: 2 '.'s (columns 0,1)\n\nRow 3: 3 '.'s (columns 0,1,3)\n\nRow 4: 2 '.'s (columns 0,1)\n\nRow 5: 2 '.'s (columns 0,1)\n\nRow 6: 2 '.'s (columns 0,9)\n\nRow 7: 2 '.'s (columns 0,9)\n\nRow 8: 3 '.'s (columns 0,1,9)\n\nRow 9: 4 '.'s (columns 0,1,8,9)\n\nTotal unexplored squares: 3+2+2+3+2+2+2+2+3+4 = 25 unexplored squares.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there are 10 bombs in total, and 9 flags remaining, meaning one flag is already placed. So, 10 bombs -1 =9 bombs left to flag.\n\nSo, out of 25 unexplored squares, 9 are bombs, and 16 are safe.\n\nI need to find a way to identify which ones are safe to reveal or which ones should be flagged.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a square that, if revealed, would give me more information to proceed.\n\nLet's consider row 6, column 9, which is '1' and '.'. Wait, no, '1' is a revealed number, and adjacent to it are other numbers.\n\nWait, row 6, column 9 is '1' and '.'.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier.\n\nLooking back, row 6, column 9 is '1' and '.'.\n\nSo, '1' is a revealed number, and '.' is an unexplored square adjacent to it.\n\nSo, the '1' at (6,9) indicates one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (5,9)\n\n- (6,8)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (7,9)\n\nStatus:\n\n- (5,8): '1'\n\n- (5,9): '1'\n\n- (6,8): '1'\n\n- (7,8): '1'\n\n- (7,9): '1'\n\nWait, all these are '1's, which are safe. So, perhaps the bomb is actually on (6,10), but that doesn't exist. This is confusing.\n\nMaybe the '1' at (6,9) is indicating a bomb in a different location, but given the adjacency, it must be one of the adjacent squares, which are all '1's, meaning safe. This doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps there's an error in the board representation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the bomb is on an unexplored square adjacent to multiple numbers.\n\nWait, let's look at row 2, column 6. It's '1', and adjacent to it are:\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (3,7)\n\nStatus:\n\n- (1,5): '1'\n\n- (1,6): '1'\n\n- (1,7): '_'\n\n- (2,5): '.'\n\n- (2,7): '.'\n\n- (3,5): '1'\n\n- (3,6): '1'\n\n- (3,7): '_'\n\nSo, the '1' at (2,6) has adjacent unexplored squares at (2,5), (2,7), and possibly others.\n\nGiven that, perhaps placing a flag on one of these unexplored squares could satisfy the '1's.\n\nBut it's not clear.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for me to figure out right now. Maybe I should just pick a square that seems safe and reveal it, accepting the risk.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 2, which is '1', and adjacent to it are:\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (7,2)\n\n- (7,3)\n\nStatus:\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\n- (5,2): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '.'\n\n- (6,1): '.'\n\n- (6,3): '.'\n\n- (7,1): '.'\n\n- (7,2): '.'\n\n- (7,3): '.'\n\nWait, no, looking back, row 6, column 2 is '1', and adjacent squares are all '.'s, meaning unexplored.\n\nWait, no, row 6, column 2 is '1', and adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\n- (5,2): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '.'\n\n- (6,1): '.'\n\n- (6,3): '.'\n\n- (7,1): '.'\n\n- (7,2): '.'\n\n- (7,3): '.'\n\nSo, the '1' at (6,2) has eight unexplored adjacent squares, and it needs one of them to be a bomb.\n\nThis is not helpful for determining a safe move.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that since I have 9 flags left and 9 bombs to find, I should place flags on squares that seem dangerous.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to place flags incorrectly, as that could lead to losing the game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a group of squares where the number of unflagged squares equals the number of remaining bombs.\n\nBut with 25 unexplored squares and 9 bombs left, that's not the case yet.\n\nWait, 25 unexplored squares and 9 bombs left.\n\nIf I can find a group of squares where the number of unflagged squares equals the number of bombs needed based on the adjacent numbers, then I can flag those squares as bombs.\n\nBut that requires identifying such a group, which is not straightforward.\n\nGiven the complexity of the board, perhaps the best approach is to make an educated guess and reveal a square that seems likely to be safe.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 4, which is '1', and adjacent to it are:\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (7,3)\n\n- (7,4)\n\n- (7,5)\n\nStatus:\n\n- (5,3): '2'\n\n- (5,4): '2'\n\n- (5,5): '.'\n\n- (6,3): '1'\n\n- (6,5): '.'\n\n- (7,3): '1'\n\n- (7,4): '1'\n\n- (7,5): '.'\n\nSo, around the '1' at (6,4), there are some unexplored squares at (5,5), (6,5), and (7,5).\n\nGiven that, perhaps revealing (6,5) could be safe, as it's adjacent to '1's and '2's, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps placing a flag on one of these unexplored squares if it makes sense with the numbers.\n\nBut I'm not confident about that.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this, I think I'll have to make a move based on probability.\n\nI'll choose to reveal row 6, column 5, hoping it's safe.\n\nEXPLANATION: After analyzing the board and considering the positions of the numbers and unexplored squares, I've decided to reveal row 6, column 5. This square is adjacent to several '1's and '2's, which suggest that there are bombs nearby, but I believe the risk is manageable given the current state of the board.\n\nMOVE: 6,5,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n1 . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n2 . . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n7 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n8 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n9 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. I need to be careful and make sure I don't step on any bombs.\n\nFirst, I should look at the numbers and see what they're telling me about the surrounding squares. Numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that square. So, for example, a '1' means there's one bomb in the eight surrounding squares, a '2' means two bombs, and so on up to '8'.\n\nLet's start from the top left corner and work our way across and down.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Column 2 has a '1'. That means one of the eight surrounding squares has a bomb.\n\n- Column 8 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 9 has an 'F', which is a flagged square, so there's probably a bomb there.\n\nWait, column 9, row 0 has an 'F', and column 8 has a '1'. So, the '1' could be referring to the flagged square next to it.\n\nMoving to row 1:\n\n- Column 2 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 4 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 5 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 6 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 8 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 9 has a '1'.\n\nThis row has multiple '1's, and some of them might be related to the flagged square in row 0, column 9.\n\nRow 2:\n\n- Column 2 has a '2'.\n\n- Column 3 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 4 has a '2'.\n\n- Column 6 has a '1'.\n\nRow 3:\n\n- Column 0 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 1 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 2 has a '2'.\n\n- Column 4 has a '3'.\n\n- Column 5 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 6 has a '1'.\n\nRow 4:\n\n- Column 2 has a '2'.\n\n- Column 4 has a '2'.\n\nRow 5:\n\n- Column 2 has a '2'.\n\n- Column 4 has a '2'.\n\n- Column 9 has a '1'.\n\nRow 6:\n\n- Column 2 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 4 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 9 has a '1'.\n\nRow 7:\n\n- Column 2 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 3 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 4 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 9 has a '1'.\n\nRow 8:\n\n- Column 0 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 1 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 8 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 9 has a '1'.\n\nRow 9:\n\n- Column 1 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 8 has a '1'.\n\n- Column 9 has a '.'.\n\nOkay, that's a lot to take in. Let's try to find some definite moves.\n\nFirst, I notice that in row 0, column 9 is flagged. So, that's probably a bomb. Let's consider the '1' in row 0, column 8. Since it's a '1', and it's adjacent to the flagged square, that likely satisfies its bomb count. So, the other squares around it should be safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 7 is '_', which is empty revealed space. So, it's safe. Maybe I can reveal row 0, column 7.\n\nWait, but let's check the surroundings of row 0, column 8.\n\nRow 0, column 8 has a '1', and it's adjacent to the flagged square at row 0, column 9. So, the '1' is satisfied by that flag. Therefore, the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nSo, the squares adjacent to row 0, column 8 are:\n\n- row 0, column 7: already revealed as '_'\n\n- row 1, column 7\n\n- row 1, column 8\n\n- row 1, column 9\n\n- row 0, column 9: flagged\n\nSo, row 1, column 7, 8, and 9 are all '.' , which are unexplored. Since the '1' is already satisfied by the flag at row 0, column 9, these should be safe to reveal.\n\nLet me check row 1, column 7.\n\nWait, but row 1, column 7 is '_', which is already revealed.\n\nActually, looking back, row 1, column 7 is '_', yes.\n\nSo, row 1, column 7 is already revealed as empty.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 8 is '.', unexplored.\n\nRow 1, column 9 is '.', unexplored.\n\nSince the '1' is already satisfied by the flag at row 0, column 9, these should be safe.\n\nSo, I can probably reveal row 1, column 8 and row 1, column 9.\n\nBut let's see what's at row 1, column 8.\n\nWait, row 1, column 8 is a '1'.\n\nOh, wait, in the original board state:\n\nRow 1, column 8 is '_', not '1'. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the original board state:\n\nRow 0: . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n\nRow 1: . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n\nRow 2: . . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 3: 1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 4: _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 5: _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1\n\nRow 6: _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 7: _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 8: 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n\nRow 9: . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nWait, in row 1, column 8 is '_', not '1'. I must have misread.\n\nSo, row 1, column 8 is '_', and column 9 is '1'.\n\nSo, row 1, column 9 is '1'.\n\nWait, so row 1, column 9 is '1', and row 0, column 9 is 'F'.\n\nSo, the '1' at row 1, column 9 is adjacent to the flagged square at row 0, column 9, so that satisfies its bomb count.\n\nTherefore, the other adjacent squares to row 1, column 9 should be safe.\n\nLet's see the surroundings of row 1, column 9:\n\n- row 0, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 0, column 9: 'F'\n\n- row 0, column 10: out of bounds\n\n- row 1, column 8: '_'\n\n- row 1, column 10: out of bounds\n\n- row 2, column 8: '_'\n\n- row 2, column 9: '_'\n\n- row 2, column 10: out of bounds\n\nSo, the '1' is satisfied by the flag at row 0, column 9.\n\nTherefore, the other adjacent squares, which are row 1, column 8 ('_'), row 2, column 8 ('_'), and row 2, column 9 ('_'), should be safe.\n\nBut row 1, column 8 is already revealed as '_'.\n\nSo, maybe I can reveal row 2, column 8 and row 2, column 9.\n\nLet's see what's at row 2, column 8: '_', which is already revealed.\n\nRow 2, column 9: '_', already revealed.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 2: . . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n\nSo, row 2, column 8 is '_', and column 9 is '_'.\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought they were '_', but according to the board state, they are '_'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look again.\n\nWait, in row 2, column 8 and 9 are both '_', meaning they are empty revealed spaces.\n\nSo, perhaps there's another area I can look at.\n\nLet's look at row 3, column 4 has a '3'.\n\nA '3' means there are three bombs adjacent to it.\n\nLet's see the surroundings of row 3, column 4:\n\n- row 2, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 2, column 4: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 2, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 3, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 3, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 4, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 4: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, none of these are flagged yet.\n\nSince it's a '3', and none are flagged, that means three of these eight squares have bombs.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine which ones specifically.\n\nMaybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at row 3, column 6 has a '1'.\n\nSurroundings:\n\n- row 2, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 2, column 6: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 2, column 7: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 3, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 3, column 7: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 6: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 7: '.' (unexplored)\n\nWait, but row 3, column 5 is '1', which is already revealed.\n\nSo, the '1' at row 3, column 6 is adjacent to row 3, column 5 ('1'), which is already revealed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the numbers together.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the fact that there are 10 bombs in total, and 9 flags remaining, meaning one flag has already been placed.\n\nSo, perhaps I can try to find areas where the number of unflagged squares matches the remaining bomb count for that number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look for squares that are definitely safe.\n\nLet me look at row 6, column 9 has a '1'.\n\nSurroundings:\n\n- row 5, column 8: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 5, column 9: '1'\n\n- row 5, column 10: out of bounds\n\n- row 6, column 8: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 6, column 10: out of bounds\n\n- row 7, column 8: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 7, column 9: '1'\n\n- row 7, column 10: out of bounds\n\nSo, the '1' at row 6, column 9 is adjacent to row 5, column 9 ('1'), row 6, column 8 ('.'), row 7, column 9 ('1'), and row 7, column 8 ('.').\n\nWait, but row 5, column 9 is '1', which is already revealed.\n\nSo, perhaps the '1' at row 6, column 9 is referring to a bomb in either row 6, column 8 or row 7, column 8.\n\nBut I don't know which one.\n\nMaybe I can't conclude anything here yet.\n\nLet's look at row 8, column 8 has a '1'.\n\nSurroundings:\n\n- row 7, column 7: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 7, column 8: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 7, column 9: '1'\n\n- row 8, column 7: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 8, column 9: '1'\n\n- row 9, column 7: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 9, column 8: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 9, column 9: '1'\n\nSo, the '1' at row 8, column 8 is adjacent to row 7, column 8 ('.'), row 7, column 9 ('1'), row 8, column 9 ('1'), and row 9, column 8 ('.').\n\nSince it's a '1', and it's adjacent to two '1's, which are already revealed, it's likely that the bomb is in one of the unexplored squares.\n\nBut again, not enough information.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total number of flags left and see if I can find patterns that fit the remaining bomb count.\n\nCurrently, there's one flag placed, and 9 flags remaining, with 10 bombs in total.\n\nSo, 9 bombs still need to be flagged.\n\nI need to be careful not to place flags on safe squares.\n\nLet me look for areas where the number of unflagged adjacent squares matches the number needed for the bomb count.\n\nFor example, if a '2' has two adjacent unexplored squares, and no flags, then both must be bombs.\n\nAlternatively, if a '2' has one flag and one unexplored square, then the unexplored square is safe.\n\nI need to find such relationships.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 4 has a '1'.\n\nSurroundings:\n\n- row 0, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 0, column 4: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 0, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 1, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 1, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 2, column 3: '1'\n\n- row 2, column 4: '2'\n\n- row 2, column 5: '2'\n\nSo, the '1' at row 1, column 4 is adjacent to row 1, column 5 ('1'), row 2, column 4 ('2'), and row 2, column 5 ('2').\n\nWait, but some of the adjacent squares are unexplored.\n\nActually, row 1, column 3 is '.', row 0, column 4 is '.', etc.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the fact that there are 9 flags left and 10 bombs.\n\nPerhaps I can look for areas where the number of possible bomb locations is equal to the number of remaining flags.\n\nBut with 9 flags left and 10 bombs, maybe one bomb is already flagged.\n\nWait, but I have one flag already placed.\n\nSo, perhaps that flag is correctly placed, and I need to place 9 more flags to mark the remaining 9 bombs.\n\nWait, but the game says flags remaining: 9, bombs:10.\n\nSo, perhaps one bomb is already flagged, and I need to flag the remaining 9.\n\nBut I need to confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the game allows placing more flags than bombs, but it's better to assume that I need to place exactly 10 flags on bombs.\n\nSo, with one flag already placed, I need to place 9 more.\n\nI need to be careful not to place flags on safe squares.\n\nLet me look for a square that is definitely a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4 has a '3'.\n\nSurroundings:\n\n- row 2, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 2, column 4: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 2, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 3, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 3, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 4, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 4: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, eight unexplored squares around the '3'.\n\nThat's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for overlapping areas where multiple numbers share some unexplored squares.\n\nFor example, row 3, column 4 ('3') and row 3, column 6 ('1') share some unexplored squares.\n\nWait, row 3, column 6 is '1', and its surroundings include row 3, column 5 ('1'), which is already revealed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the '1' at row 3, column 6.\n\nSurroundings:\n\n- row 2, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 2, column 6: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 2, column 7: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 3, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 3, column 7: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 6: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 7: '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, the '1' at row 3, column 6 is adjacent to one bomb.\n\nIf none of these are flagged yet, and there's only one bomb in these eight squares, then the other seven are safe.\n\nBut I don't know which one is the bomb.\n\nSimilarly, the '3' at row 3, column 4 is adjacent to three bombs.\n\nBut again, with eight unexplored squares around it, it's hard to pinpoint.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different area.\n\nLet me look at row 5, column 4 has a '2'.\n\nSurroundings:\n\n- row 4, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 4: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 4, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 5, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 5, column 5: '2'\n\n- row 6, column 3: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 6, column 4: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 6, column 5: '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo, the '2' at row 5, column 4 is adjacent to row 5, column 5 ('2'), and the other surroundings are unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, the '2' at row 5, column 5 is adjacent to row 5, column 4 ('2'), and other unexplored squares.\n\nThis seems like another complex area.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking back at row 0, column 7 is '_', which is already revealed.\n\nAdjacent to it are:\n\n- row 0, column 6: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 0, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 1, column 6: '.' (unexplored)\n\n- row 1, column 7: '_'\n\n- row 1, column 8: '_'\n\nSo, row 0, column 7 is adjacent to row 0, column 8 ('1'), which is already satisfied by the flag at row 0, column 9.\n\nTherefore, the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nSo, perhaps I can reveal row 0, column 6.\n\nBut in the board state, row 0, column 6 is '.', which is unexplored.\n\nWait, but row 0, column 6 is adjacent to row 0, column 7 ('_'), row 0, column 8 ('1'), row 1, column 6 ('.'), row 1, column 7 ('_'), and row 1, column 8 ('_').\n\nGiven that the '1' at row 0, column 8 is satisfied by the flag at row 0, column 9, these should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can probably reveal row 0, column 6.\n\nLet me try that.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The '1' at row 0, column 8 is satisfied by the flagged square at row 0, column 9. Therefore, the adjacent squares at row 0, column 7 and row 1, column 7-9 should be safe. Since row 0, column 6 is adjacent to these safe squares, it should also be safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,6,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n1 . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n2 . . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n7 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n8 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n9 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 8, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. I need to be careful and make sure I don't step on any bombs.\n\nFirst, I should look at the numbers and see what they're telling me about the surrounding squares. Numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that square. So, for example, a '1' means there's one bomb in the eight surrounding squares, a '2' means two bombs, and so on up to '8'.\n\nLet's start by looking at the top row:\n\nRow 0:\n\nColumn 2 has a '1', and column 8 has a '1' and an 'F'. So, column 8 has a flag, which means there's a bomb there. Since column 8 has a '1', that means only one adjacent square is a bomb. Since there's already a flag there, the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nWait, let's look closer. In row 0, column 8 has a '1', and there's a flag in that square. Wait, no, the 'F' is in row 0, column 9. So, row 0, column 9 is flagged. And row 0, column 8 has a '1'. So, the '1' in row 0, column 8 means there's one bomb in the adjacent squares. Since row 0, column 9 is flagged, that accounts for the one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares to row 0, column 8 should be safe.\n\nLet's see what's adjacent to row 0, column 8: row 0, column 7; row 1, column 7; row 1, column 8; row 1, column 9. But row 0, column 7 is '.', which is unexplored; row 1, column 7 is '.', row 1, column 8 is '.', and row 1, column 9 is '1'. But row 0, column 9 is flagged.\n\nSo, since the '1' is already accounted for by the flag in row 0, column 9, the other adjacent squares should be safe. Therefore, I can safely reveal row 0, column 7; row 1, column 7; and row 1, column 8.\n\nBut let's see what's in row 1, column 8. Row 1, column 8 is '.', which is unexplored. Similarly, row 1, column 7 is '.'.\n\nWait, but row 1, column 9 is '1', which means there's one bomb in its adjacent squares. Row 1, column 9 is adjacent to row 0, column 9 (flagged), row 1, column 8 ('.'), row 2, column 8 ('.'), row 2, column 9 ('.'), row 1, column 10 (which doesn't exist, since columns go from 0 to 9).\n\nWait, row 1 has columns 0 to 9. So, row 1, column 9 is adjacent to row 0, column 9 (flagged), row 1, column 8 ('.'), row 2, column 8 ('.'), and row 2, column 9 ('.').\n\nSince row 1, column 9 shows '1', and row 0, column 9 is flagged, that accounts for the one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares: row 1, column 8; row 2, column 8; and row 2, column 9 should be safe.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal those squares.\n\nBut let's see if revealing row 1, column 8 will give me more information.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by revealing row 0, column 7, since it's adjacent to row 0, column 8.\n\nBut before doing that, let's look at row 2, column 8. Row 2, column 8 is '_', which is an empty revealed space. So, row 1, column 8 is adjacent to row 0, column 8 ('1'), row 1, column 7 ('.'), row 2, column 7 ('.'), row 2, column 8 ('_'), and row 2, column 9 ('.').\n\nSince row 2, column 8 is empty, that means there are no bombs adjacent to it. So, all its adjacent squares are safe. That includes row 1, column 8; row 1, column 7; row 2, column 7; and row 2, column 9.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal row 1, column 7; row 1, column 8; and row 2, column 7; and row 2, column 9.\n\nLet's pick one of them to reveal. Maybe row 1, column 7.\n\nBut wait, there might be a better place to start.\n\nLet me look at row 2, column 2. Row 2, column 2 has a '2', which is adjacent to row 1, column 1 ('.'), row 1, column 2 ('.'), row 1, column 3 ('1'), row 2, column 1 ('.'), row 2, column 3 ('1'), row 3, column 1 ('1'), row 3, column 2 ('1'), and row 3, column 3 ('2').\n\nWait, but row 2, column 2 is '2', and it's adjacent to row 1, column 1 ('.'), row 1, column 2 ('.'), row 1, column 3 ('1'), row 2, column 1 ('.'), row 2, column 3 ('1'), row 3, column 1 ('1'), row 3, column 2 ('1'), and row 3, column 3 ('2').\n\nSo, the '2' in row 2, column 2 means there are two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at these adjacent squares, none of them are flagged yet, and some are revealed numbers.\n\nWait, row 1, column 3 is '1', which is adjacent to row 0, column 3 ('.'), row 0, column 4 ('.'), row 0, column 5 ('.'), row 1, column 2 ('.'), row 1, column 4 ('1'), row 2, column 2 ('2'), row 2, column 3 ('1'), row 2, column 4 ('2').\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler scenario.\n\nLet's look at row 3, column 3. It's a '2', adjacent to row 2, column 2 ('2'), row 2, column 3 ('1'), row 2, column 4 ('2'), row 3, column 2 ('1'), row 3, column 4 ('3'), row 4, column 2 ('_'), row 4, column 3 ('.'), row 4, column 4 ('.'). Wait, row 4, column 3 is '.', and row 4, column 4 is '.'.\n\nThe '2' in row 3, column 3 is adjacent to:\n\n- row 2, column 2 ('2')\n\n- row 2, column 3 ('1')\n\n- row 2, column 4 ('2')\n\n- row 3, column 2 ('1')\n\n- row 3, column 4 ('3')\n\n- row 4, column 2 ('_')\n\n- row 4, column 3 ('.')\n\n- row 4, column 4 ('.')\n\nSo, the '2' in row 3, column 3 needs two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut row 2, column 3 is '1', which has its own bomb count.\n\nThis seems too interconnected to make a straightforward decision.\n\nMaybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at row 5, column 4. It's a '2', adjacent to row 4, column 3 ('.'), row 4, column 4 ('.'), row 4, column 5 ('.'), row 5, column 3 ('2'), row 5, column 5 ('2'), row 6, column 3 ('1'), row 6, column 4 ('1'), row 6, column 5 ('1').\n\nWait, row 5, column 4 is '2', adjacent to:\n\n- row 4, column 3 ('.')\n\n- row 4, column 4 ('.')\n\n- row 4, column 5 ('.')\n\n- row 5, column 3 ('2')\n\n- row 5, column 5 ('2')\n\n- row 6, column 3 ('1')\n\n- row 6, column 4 ('1')\n\n- row 6, column 5 ('1')\n\nSo, the '2' in row 5, column 4 needs two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 4, which is '1', adjacent to row 5, column 3 ('2'), row 5, column 4 ('2'), row 5, column 5 ('2'), row 6, column 3 ('1'), row 6, column 5 ('1'), row 7, column 3 ('1'), row 7, column 4 ('1'), row 7, column 5 ('1').\n\nThis also seems complex.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a square where the number of adjacent flags equals the number itself, indicating the remaining adjacent squares are safe.\n\nOr where the number of adjacent unflagged squares equals the remaining bomb count.\n\nWait, I have to be careful.\n\nLet me think about row 0, column 8 again.\n\nRow 0, column 8 has a '1', and row 0, column 9 is flagged.\n\nTherefore, the '1' is satisfied, so the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nSo, I can reveal row 1, column 8.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 9 has a '1', and row 0, column 9 is flagged, so the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nSo, row 1, column 8; row 2, column 8; and row 2, column 9 are safe.\n\nI can reveal row 1, column 8.\n\nBut before doing that, let's see what's in row 1, column 8.\n\nIt's currently '.', which is unexplored.\n\nRevealing it should be safe, as per the earlier reasoning.\n\nBut let's see what happens if I reveal row 1, column 8.\n\nIf it's a number, it might give me more information about the surrounding squares.\n\nIf it's empty, it will reveal more squares.\n\nBut since row 2, column 8 is already empty, revealing row 1, column 8 should connect to that empty area.\n\nAlternatively, I can reveal row 1, column 7, which is also adjacent to row 0, column 8.\n\nWait, row 1, column 7 is '.', and row 1, column 8 is '.'.\n\nI think revealing either should be safe.\n\nMaybe I'll choose row 1, column 7.\n\nBut actually, row 1, column 7 is adjacent to row 0, column 7 ('.'), row 0, column 8 ('1'), row 0, column 9 ('F'), row 1, column 6 ('.'), row 1, column 8 ('.'), row 2, column 6 ('.'), row 2, column 7 ('.'), row 2, column 8 ('_').\n\nWait, row 2, column 8 is empty, which means none of its adjacent squares are bombs.\n\nTherefore, row 1, column 7 is adjacent to row 2, column 7 ('.'), which is adjacent to row 2, column 8 ('_'), which has no bombs around it.\n\nTherefore, row 2, column 7 is safe, and by extension, row 1, column 7 is also safe.\n\nSo, I can reveal row 1, column 7.\n\nBut perhaps I should reveal row 1, column 8 instead, since it's adjacent to more revealed squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a place with fewer possibilities.\n\nLet me look at row 9, column 1. It's a '1', adjacent to row 8, column 0 ('1'), row 8, column 1 ('1'), row 8, column 2 ('.'), row 9, column 0 ('1'), row 9, column 2 ('.'), row 10, column 0 ('.'), row 10, column 1 ('.'), row 10, column 2 ('.').\n\nWait, row 9, column 1 is '1', adjacent to:\n\n- row 8, column 0 ('1')\n\n- row 8, column 1 ('1')\n\n- row 8, column 2 ('.')\n\n- row 9, column 0 ('1')\n\n- row 9, column 2 ('.')\n\n- row 10, column 0 ('.')\n\n- row 10, column 1 ('.')\n\n- row 10, column 2 ('.')\n\nSo, the '1' needs one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 0 ('1') and row 8, column 1 ('1'), they might have their own bomb requirements.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky.\n\nMaybe I should look at row 6, column 4, which is '1', adjacent to row 5, column 3 ('2'), row 5, column 4 ('2'), row 5, column 5 ('2'), row 6, column 3 ('1'), row 6, column 5 ('1'), row 7, column 3 ('1'), row 7, column 4 ('1'), row 7, column 5 ('1').\n\nAgain, too many interconnected numbers.\n\nPerhaps I should try to find a square that's definitely safe or definitely a bomb.\n\nWait, let's look at row 4, column 3. It's '.', and it's adjacent to row 3, column 2 ('1'), row 3, column 3 ('2'), row 3, column 4 ('3'), row 4, column 2 ('_'), row 4, column 4 ('.'), row 5, column 2 ('_'), row 5, column 3 ('2'), row 5, column 4 ('2').\n\nThe row 3, column 3 is '2', and row 3, column 4 is '3'.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possibility of placing a flag in a likely bomb location.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 4. It's '1', adjacent to row 0, column 3 ('.'), row 0, column 4 ('.'), row 0, column 5 ('.'), row 1, column 3 ('1'), row 1, column 5 ('1'), row 2, column 3 ('1'), row 2, column 4 ('2'), row 2, column 5 ('.').\n\nThe '1' in row 1, column 4 needs one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 5 is '1', adjacent to row 0, column 4 ('.'), row 0, column 5 ('.'), row 0, column 6 ('.'), row 1, column 4 ('1'), row 1, column 6 ('1'), row 2, column 4 ('2'), row 2, column 5 ('.'), row 2, column 6 ('.').\n\nThis seems like a cluster with multiple '1's and '2's, which is difficult to resolve without more information.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a square that, if revealed, would give me information about multiple areas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just pick a square that I'm confident is safe and reveal it to expand the known area.\n\nLooking back at row 0, column 7. It's '.', and based on earlier reasoning, it should be safe.\n\nSo, I'll go ahead and reveal row 0, column 7.\n\nBut before doing that, let me double-check.\n\nRow 0, column 7 is adjacent to row 0, column 6 ('.'), row 0, column 8 ('1'), row 0, column 9 ('F'), row 1, column 6 ('.'), row 1, column 7 ('.'), row 1, column 8 ('.'), row 2, column 6 ('.'), row 2, column 7 ('.'), row 2, column 8 ('_').\n\nSince row 2, column 8 is empty, none of its adjacent squares are bombs.\n\nTherefore, row 1, column 7; row 1, column 8; row 2, column 7; and row 2, column 8 are all safe.\n\nSo, revealing row 0, column 7 should be safe.\n\nBut perhaps I should reveal row 1, column 7 instead, since it's adjacent to more revealed squares.\n\nWait, row 1, column 7 is adjacent to row 0, column 6 ('.'), row 0, column 7 ('.'), row 0, column 8 ('1'), row 1, column 6 ('.'), row 1, column 8 ('.'), row 2, column 6 ('.'), row 2, column 7 ('.'), row 2, column 8 ('_').\n\nAgain, since row 2, column 8 is empty, row 1, column 7 should be safe.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing row 1, column 7.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider row 1, column 8.\n\nRow 1, column 8 is adjacent to row 0, column 7 ('.'), row 0, column 8 ('1'), row 0, column 9 ('F'), row 1, column 7 ('.'), row 1, column 9 ('1'), row 2, column 7 ('.'), row 2, column 8 ('_'), row 2, column 9 ('.').\n\nAgain, since row 0, column 9 is flagged, the '1' in row 0, column 8 is satisfied, so the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nTherefore, row 1, column 8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 9 is adjacent to row 1, column 8 ('.'), row 1, column 9 ('1'), row 2, column 8 ('_'), row 3, column 8 ('.'), row 3, column 9 ('.'), row 4, column 8 ('.'), row 4, column 9 ('.'), row 5, column 9 ('1').\n\nBut row 1, column 9 has a '1', with row 0, column 8 ('1'), row 0, column 9 ('F'), row 1, column 8 ('.'), row 1, column 10 (out of bounds), row 2, column 8 ('_'), row 2, column 9 ('.'), row 3, column 8 ('.'), row 3, column 9 ('.').\n\nSince row 0, column 9 is flagged, the '1' is satisfied, so the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nTherefore, row 1, column 8; row 2, column 8; and row 2, column 9 are all safe.\n\nI think I'll choose to reveal row 1, column 8.\n\nBut before making that move, let's see what's the potential outcome.\n\nIf I reveal row 1, column 8, and it's a number, it might give me more information about the surrounding squares.\n\nIf it's empty, it will reveal more squares, possibly connecting to row 2, column 8, which is already empty.\n\nEither way, it seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, revealing row 1, column 7 might also be safe, and could potentially connect to other safe areas.\n\nBut row 1, column 8 seems slightly better connected, so I'll go with that.\n\nTherefore, my next move is to reveal row 1, column 8.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed safely in this Minesweeper game, the next move should be to reveal the square at position (1,8). This decision is based on the analysis of the board state, where the '1' in position (0,8) indicates only one adjacent bomb, which is already flagged at (0,9). Therefore, the other adjacent squares to (0,8), including (1,8), should be safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE: 1,8,false**", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n1 . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n2 . . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n7 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n8 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n9 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. I need to be careful and make sure I don't step on any bombs.\n\nFirst, I should look at the numbers and see what they're telling me about the surrounding squares. Numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that square. So, for example, a '1' means there's one bomb in the eight surrounding squares, a '2' means two bombs, and so on up to '8'.\n\nLet's start by looking at the top row:\n\nRow 0:\n\nColumn 2 has a '1', and column 8 has a '1' and an 'F'. So, column 8 has a flag, which means there's a bomb there. Since column 8 has a '1', that means only one adjacent square is a bomb. Since there's already a flag there, the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nWait, let's look closer. In row 0, column 8 has a '1', and there's a flag in that square. Wait, no, the 'F' is in row 0, column 9. So, row 0, column 9 is flagged. And row 0, column 8 has a '1'. So, the '1' in row 0, column 8 means there's one bomb in the adjacent squares. Since row 0, column 9 is flagged, that accounts for the one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares to row 0, column 8 should be safe.\n\nLet's see what's adjacent to row 0, column 8: row 0, column 7; row 1, column 7; row 1, column 8; row 1, column 9. But row 0, column 7 is '.', which is unexplored; row 1, column 7 is '.', row 1, column 8 is '.', and row 1, column 9 is '1'. But row 0, column 9 is flagged.\n\nSo, since the '1' is already accounted for by the flag in row 0, column 9, the other adjacent squares should be safe. Therefore, I can safely reveal row 0, column 7; row 1, column 7; and row 1, column 8.\n\nBut let's see what's in row 1, column 8. Row 1, column 8 is '.', which is unexplored. Similarly, row 1, column 7 is '.'.\n\nWait, but row 1, column 9 is '1', which means there's one bomb in its adjacent squares. Row 1, column 9 is adjacent to row 0, column 9 (flagged), row 1, column 8 ('.'), row 2, column 8 ('.'), row 2, column 9 ('.'), row 1, column 10 (which doesn't exist, since columns go from 0 to 9).\n\nWait, row 1 has columns 0 to 9. So, row 1, column 9 is adjacent to row 0, column 9 (flagged), row 1, column 8 ('.'), row 2, column 8 ('.'), and row 2, column 9 ('.').\n\nSince row 1, column 9 shows '1', and row 0, column 9 is flagged, that accounts for the one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent squares: row 1, column 8; row 2, column 8; and row 2, column 9 should be safe.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal those squares.\n\nBut let's see if revealing row 1, column 8 will give me more information.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by revealing row 0, column 7, since it's adjacent to the '1' in row 0, column 8, and we've established that it should be safe.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nEXPLANATION: The '1' in row 0, column 8 has its bomb accounted for by the flag in row 0, column 9. Therefore, the adjacent squares to row 0, column 8, excluding the flagged square, should be safe.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. I need to be careful not to step on any bombs while trying to reveal all the safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs.\n\nFirst, I should look at the numbers and see what they're telling me about the surrounding squares. Numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that square. So, for example, a '1' means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares.\n\nLet's start by scanning the board for any obvious moves. I'll look for places where the number of flags around a numbered square matches the number itself, which would mean the remaining adjacent squares are safe to reveal. Conversely, if the number of flags is less than the number, and there are only that many unflagged squares left, those must be bombs.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Column 2 has a '1'. Let's see its neighbors: left is '.', up is '.', down is '.', right is '_', and diagonals are all '.' or '_'. So, only some of these are revealed. I need to see if any of these neighbors are flagged.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the board seems to have some revealed numbers and some unexplored spaces. I need to pay attention to which squares are revealed and which aren't.\n\nLet me try to get a better overview. It might help to look for areas where I can make progress based on the current revelations.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 2 has a '2', and column 3 has a '1', column 4 has a '2'. This seems like a connected area with some information.\n\nLet me focus on row 2, column 2 ('2'):\n\n- Its neighbors are:\n\n- Left: row 2, column 1 ('.')\n\n- Up: row 1, column 2 ('1')\n\n- Right: row 2, column 3 ('1')\n\n- Down: row 3, column 2 ('2')\n\n- Diagonals:\n\n- Top-left: row 1, column 1 ('.')\n\n- Top-right: row 1, column 3 ('1')\n\n- Bottom-left: row 3, column 1 ('1')\n\n- Bottom-right: row 3, column 3 ('2')\n\nNow, the '2' in row 2, column 2 needs exactly two bombs in these eight neighbors.\n\nLooking at these neighbors:\n\n- row 1, column 2: '1'\n\n- row 2, column 3: '1'\n\n- row 3, column 2: '2'\n\n- row 1, column 1: '.'\n\n- row 1, column 3: '1'\n\n- row 3, column 1: '1'\n\n- row 3, column 3: '2'\n\n- row 2, column 1: '.'\n\nSo, among these, some are numbers and some are unexplored. I need to see if any of these are flagged or if I can deduce where the bombs are.\n\nWait, I need to check if any of these neighbors are flagged. From the board, I don't see any flags in these positions. So, no flags around this '2'.\n\nSimilarly, the '1' in row 1, column 2 has its own set of neighbors, and so on.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated to untangle immediately. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother strategy is to look for squares that are definitely safe to reveal or definitely need to be flagged.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 9 has a '1', and row 1, column 9 has a '1', and row 2, column 8 is unexplored.\n\nWait, let's look at row 0:\n\n- Column 0: '.'\n\n- Column 1: '.'\n\n- Column 2: '1'\n\n- Column 3: '_'\n\n- Column 4: '_'\n\n- Column 5: '_'\n\n- Column 6: '_'\n\n- Column 7: '_'\n\n- Column 8: '1'\n\n- Column 9: 'F' (flagged)\n\nSo, column 9, row 0 is flagged, which means it's supposed to be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 9 has a '1', which means there's one bomb in its eight neighbors. Since row 0, column 9 is flagged, that accounts for the '1'. So, the other neighbors should be safe.\n\nLet's see the neighbors of row 1, column 9 ('1'):\n\n- Left: row 1, column 8 ('1')\n\n- Up: row 0, column 9 ('F')\n\n- Right: row 1, column 10 (out of bounds)\n\n- Down: row 2, column 9 ('_')\n\n- Top-left: row 0, column 8 ('1')\n\n- Top-right: row 0, column 10 (out of bounds)\n\n- Bottom-left: row 2, column 8 ('_')\n\n- Bottom-right: row 2, column 10 (out of bounds)\n\nSo, the neighbors are:\n\n- row 0, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 0, column 9: 'F'\n\n- row 1, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 2, column 8: '_'\n\n- row 2, column 9: '_'\n\nNow, the '1' in row 1, column 9 needs exactly one bomb in these neighbors. Since row 0, column 9 is already flagged, that satisfies the '1'. Therefore, the other neighbors should be safe.\n\nSo, row 2, column 8 and row 2, column 9 can be safely revealed.\n\nLet me check if there are any flags around these squares. From the board, none are flagged.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal row 2, column 8.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. The '1' in row 1, column 9 is already satisfied with the flag in row 0, column 9. So, the remaining neighbors should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal row 2, column 8.\n\nBut let's see what's there. According to the board, it's '_', which means it's already revealed as empty.\n\nWait, but in the board representation, row 2, column 8 is '_', which means it's already revealed and empty.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board. Let me look again.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 2:\n\n2 . . 2 1 . 1 _ _\n\nSo, column 8 is '_', which is empty revealed space.\n\nWait, but I thought you can only reveal a square if it's unexplored ('.') or flag it if it's unexplored.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for another square to reveal.\n\nPerhaps I should look at another area.\n\nLet's look at row 9:\n\nRow 9:\n\n9 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nSo, column 1 has a '1', column 8 has a '1', and column 10 has a '.'.\n\nLooking at the '1' in row 9, column 1:\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- Left: out of bounds\n\n- Up: row 8, column 1 ('1')\n\n- Right: row 9, column 2 ('1')\n\n- Down: row 9, column 3 ('_')\n\n- Top-left: out of bounds\n\n- Top-right: row 8, column 2 ('1')\n\n- Bottom-left: out of bounds\n\n- Bottom-right: row 9, column 3 ('_')\n\nSo, neighbors are:\n\n- row 8, column 1: '1'\n\n- row 8, column 2: '1'\n\n- row 9, column 2: '1'\n\n- row 9, column 3: '_'\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the numbers around here.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky as well.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother strategy is to look for squares that are definitely safe or definitely bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 3 has a '2', and it has some revealed numbers around it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for areas with multiple overlapping possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to look for areas where the number of remaining possible bomb positions is equal to the number of flags left to place.\n\nBut I have 9 flags remaining, and 10 bombs in total, so one flag has already been placed.\n\nWait, no, flags remaining is 9, but bombs are 10, so perhaps one bomb is already revealed or something.\n\nWait, no, flags remaining is the number of flags you can still place. If you have 10 bombs and 9 flags remaining, that means you've already placed one flag.\n\nBut in the board, I see only one 'F' in row 0, column 9.\n\nWait, but the game info says flags remaining: 9, bombs:10.\n\nSo, you have 9 flags to place, and 10 bombs in total.\n\nMeaning, you've placed one flag already, and there are still 9 flags left to place to account for the remaining 9 bombs.\n\nWait, but according to the board, only one 'F' is present.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nLooking back, yes, only one 'F' is on the board.\n\nSo, flags remaining:9, bombs:10.\n\nMeaning, you've placed one flag, and need to place 9 more flags to account for the remaining 9 bombs.\n\nAlright, with that in mind, perhaps I should look for areas where I can safely place flags.\n\nLooking back at row 0, column 9 is flagged, and row 1, column 9 has a '1', which is satisfied by that flag.\n\nSo, as I thought earlier, row 2, column 8 and 9 are safe to reveal.\n\nBut row 2, column 8 is already revealed as empty.\n\nRow 2, column 9 is '_', which is revealed empty.\n\nWait, but in the board representation, row 2, column 9 is '_', which is revealed empty.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 8 has a '1', and row 7, column 8 has a '1', and row 8, column 8 has a '1', and row 9, column 8 has a '1'.\n\nThis seems like a vertical line of '1's.\n\nLet's see their neighbors.\n\nTake row 6, column 8 ('1'):\n\n- Its neighbors are:\n\n- Left: row 6, column 7 ('_')\n\n- Up: row 5, column 8 ('1')\n\n- Right: row 6, column 9 ('1')\n\n- Down: row 7, column 8 ('1')\n\n- Top-left: row 5, column 7 ('_')\n\n- Top-right: row 5, column 9 ('1')\n\n- Bottom-left: row 7, column 7 ('1')\n\n- Bottom-right: row 7, column 9 ('1')\n\nSo, the '1' in row 6, column 8 needs exactly one bomb in these neighbors.\n\nLooking at these neighbors:\n\n- row 5, column 7: '_'\n\n- row 5, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 5, column 9: '1'\n\n- row 6, column 7: '_'\n\n- row 6, column 9: '1'\n\n- row 7, column 7: '1'\n\n- row 7, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 7, column 9: '1'\n\nNone of these are flagged yet.\n\nSimilarly, the '1' in row 7, column 8 also has similar neighbors, and they also have '1's around them.\n\nThis seems like a chain of '1's, which might be indicating that the bombs are positioned in a specific way to satisfy all these '1's.\n\nThis might be a bit tricky to\u89e3 without affecting the overall board.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a different area.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 2 has a '2', and row 4, column 4 has a '2'.\n\nLet's see their neighbors.\n\nRow 4, column 2 ('2'):\n\n- Neighbors:\n\n- Left: out of bounds\n\n- Up: row 3, column 2 ('2')\n\n- Right: row 4, column 3 ('_')\n\n- Down: row 5, column 2 ('_')\n\n- Top-left: out of bounds\n\n- Top-right: row 3, column 3 ('2')\n\n- Bottom-left: out of bounds\n\n- Bottom-right: row 5, column 3 ('_')\n\nSo, neighbors are:\n\n- row 3, column 2: '2'\n\n- row 3, column 3: '2'\n\n- row 4, column 3: '_'\n\n- row 5, column 2: '_'\n\n- row 5, column 3: '_'\n\nSimilarly, the '2' in row 4, column 4:\n\n- Neighbors:\n\n- Left: row 4, column 3 ('_')\n\n- Up: row 3, column 4 ('3')\n\n- Right: row 4, column 5 ('1')\n\n- Down: row 5, column 4 ('2')\n\n- Top-left: row 3, column 3 ('2')\n\n- Top-right: row 3, column 5 ('1')\n\n- Bottom-left: row 5, column 3 ('_')\n\n- Bottom-right: row 5, column 5 ('1')\n\nSo, neighbors are:\n\n- row 3, column 4: '3'\n\n- row 3, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 4, column 3: '_'\n\n- row 4, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 5, column 4: '2'\n\n- row 5, column 3: '_'\n\n- row 5, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 3, column 3: '2'\n\nThis seems a bit complex to deduce immediately.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother strategy is to look for squares that are definitely safe because the number of adjacent bombs is already satisfied by existing flags.\n\nLooking back at row 0, column 9 is flagged, and row 1, column 9 has a '1', which is satisfied by that flag.\n\nTherefore, the neighbors of row 1, column 9, excluding the flagged square, should be safe.\n\nSo, row 2, column 8 and row 2, column 9 can be revealed.\n\nBut since row 2, column 8 is already revealed, perhaps row 2, column 9 is still unexplored.\n\nWait, in the board, row 2, column 9 is '_', which is revealed empty.\n\nSo, perhaps there are no unexplored safe squares in that area.\n\nMaybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 9 has a '1', and row 6, column 9 has a '1', and row 7, column 9 has a '1', and row 8, column 9 has a '1'.\n\nThis is another vertical line of '1's.\n\nLet's consider row 5, column 9 ('1'):\n\n- Neighbors:\n\n- Left: row 5, column 8 ('1')\n\n- Up: row 4, column 9 ('_')\n\n- Right: out of bounds\n\n- Down: row 6, column 9 ('1')\n\n- Top-left: row 4, column 8 ('_')\n\n- Top-right: out of bounds\n\n- Bottom-left: row 6, column 8 ('1')\n\n- Bottom-right: out of bounds\n\nSo, neighbors are:\n\n- row 4, column 8: '_'\n\n- row 4, column 9: '_'\n\n- row 5, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 6, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 6, column 9: '1'\n\nNone of these are flagged.\n\nThe '1' in row 5, column 9 needs exactly one bomb in these neighbors.\n\nSimilarly, the '1' in row 6, column 9 also needs one bomb in its neighbors.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 9 ('1'):\n\n- Neighbors:\n\n- Left: row 6, column 8 ('1')\n\n- Up: row 5, column 9 ('1')\n\n- Right: out of bounds\n\n- Down: row 7, column 9 ('1')\n\n- Top-left: row 5, column 8 ('1')\n\n- Top-right: out of bounds\n\n- Bottom-left: row 7, column 8 ('1')\n\n- Bottom-right: out of bounds\n\nSo, neighbors are:\n\n- row 5, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 5, column 9: '1'\n\n- row 6, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 7, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 7, column 9: '1'\n\nAgain, none are flagged.\n\nThis seems like a loop of '1's, which might be indicating that the bomb is somewhere that affects multiple '1's.\n\nThis could be a bit tricky to\u89e3 without making a mistake.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the possibility of placing a flag in one of the unexplored squares and see if it satisfies the surrounding numbers.\n\nBut with multiple '1's affecting each other, it's hard to pinpoint exactly where the bomb is without more information.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different area of the board.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 2 has a '1', and row 1, column 3 has a '1', and row 1, column 4 has a '1', and row 1, column 5 has a '1', and row 1, column 6 has a '1'.\n\nThis is a horizontal line of '1's in row 1.\n\nLet's see their neighbors.\n\nTake row 1, column 3 ('1'):\n\n- Neighbors:\n\n- Left: row 1, column 2 ('1')\n\n- Up: row 0, column 3 ('1')\n\n- Right: row 1, column 4 ('1')\n\n- Down: row 2, column 3 ('1')\n\n- Top-left: row 0, column 2 ('.')\n\n- Top-right: row 0, column 4 ('_')\n\n- Bottom-left: row 2, column 2 ('2')\n\n- Bottom-right: row 2, column 4 ('2')\n\nSo, neighbors are:\n\n- row 0, column 2: '.'\n\n- row 0, column 3: '1'\n\n- row 0, column 4: '_'\n\n- row 1, column 2: '1'\n\n- row 1, column 4: '1'\n\n- row 2, column 2: '2'\n\n- row 2, column 3: '1'\n\n- row 2, column 4: '2'\n\nNone of these are flagged.\n\nThe '1' in row 1, column 3 needs exactly one bomb in these neighbors.\n\nSimilarly, the '1's around it have similar requirements.\n\nThis seems like another complex area.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a square that is definitely safe or definitely a bomb.\n\nLooking back, perhaps I should consider the possibility of making a safe reveal in an area with less complexity.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 9 has a '.', which is unexplored.\n\nLet's see its neighbors.\n\nNeighbors of row 9, column 9:\n\n- Left: row 9, column 8 ('1')\n\n- Up: row 8, column 9 ('1')\n\n- Right: out of bounds\n\n- Down: out of bounds\n\n- Top-left: row 8, column 8 ('1')\n\n- Top-right: out of bounds\n\n- Bottom-left: out of bounds\n\n- Bottom-right: out of bounds\n\nSo, neighbors are:\n\n- row 8, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 8, column 9: '1'\n\n- row 9, column 8: '1'\n\nNone of these are flagged.\n\nThe '1's around it need one bomb in their neighbors.\n\nIf I reveal row 9, column 9, and it's a bomb, that would satisfy the '1's around it.\n\nBut I don't know if it's a bomb or not.\n\nAlternatively, if I place a flag there, does it satisfy the '1's?\n\nWait, row 8, column 9 has a '1', which has neighbors:\n\n- row 7, column 9 ('1')\n\n- row 7, column 8 ('1')\n\n- row 8, column 8 ('1')\n\n- row 8, column 10 (out of bounds)\n\n- row 9, column 9 ('.')\n\n- row 9, column 8 ('1')\n\n- row 7, column 10 (out of bounds)\n\n- row 9, column 10 (out of bounds)\n\nSo, neighbors are:\n\n- row 7, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 7, column 9: '1'\n\n- row 8, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 9, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 9, column 9: '.'\n\nNone are flagged.\n\nThe '1' in row 8, column 9 needs one bomb in these neighbors.\n\nIf I place a flag on row 9, column 9, that would satisfy this '1'.\n\nSimilarly, the '1' in row 9, column 8 needs one bomb in its neighbors.\n\nIf I place a flag on row 9, column 9, it would also satisfy this '1'.\n\nSimilarly, the '1' in row 8, column 8 needs one bomb in its neighbors.\n\nPlacing a flag on row 9, column 9 would also satisfy this '1'.\n\nWait, but the '1' in row 7, column 9 has a '1', which needs one bomb in its neighbors.\n\nIf I place a flag on row 9, column 9, does it satisfy that?\n\nWait, row 7, column 9's neighbors are:\n\n- row 6, column 9 ('1')\n\n- row 6, column 8 ('1')\n\n- row 7, column 8 ('1')\n\n- row 7, column 10 (out of bounds)\n\n- row 8, column 9 ('1')\n\n- row 8, column 8 ('1')\n\n- row 6, column 10 (out of bounds)\n\n- row 8, column 10 (out of bounds)\n\nSo, neighbors are:\n\n- row 6, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 6, column 9: '1'\n\n- row 7, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 8, column 8: '1'\n\n- row 8, column 9: '1'\n\nNone are flagged.\n\nIf I place a flag on row 9, column 9, it would be a neighbor of row 8, column 9, which is already satisfied.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that row 9, column 9 is a bomb, and place a flag there.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reveal another square elsewhere.\n\nLooking back at row 0, column 0 has a '.'.\n\nLet's see its neighbors.\n\nNeighbors of row 0, column 0:\n\n- Right: row 0, column 1 ('.')\n\n- Down: row 1, column 0 ('.')\n\n- Bottom-right: row 1, column 1 ('.')\n\nNone are flagged.\n\nThe square is unexplored, and its neighbors are also unexplored except for the ones on the edge.\n\nThis seems like a safe area to explore, as it's separated from the numbered areas.\n\nSo, perhaps I can reveal row 0, column 0.\n\nIf I reveal it and it's a bomb, that's unfortunate, but based on the current information, there's no indication of bombs around there.\n\nAlternatively, I can place a flag there, but that seems unwarranted without evidence.\n\nSo, perhaps the safest move is to reveal row 0, column 0.\n\nBut before doing that, let me check if there's any other area that might give me more information with less risk.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 0 has a '.'.\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- Right: row 4, column 1 ('_')\n\n- Down: row 5, column 0 ('_')\n\n- Bottom-right: row 5, column 1 ('_')\n\nNone are flagged.\n\nAgain, seems safe, but perhaps not providing immediate information.\n\nComparatively, revealing row 0, column 0 might be better, as it's in an unexplored area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for areas where the number of flags needed matches the number of unexplored squares.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4 has a '3'.\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- Left: row 3, column 3 ('2')\n\n- Up: row 2, column 4 ('1')\n\n- Right: row 3, column 5 ('1')\n\n- Down: row 4, column 4 ('2')\n\n- Top-left: row 2, column 3 ('2')\n\n- Top-right: row 2, column 5 ('.')\n\n- Bottom-left: row 4, column 3 ('_')\n\n- Bottom-right: row 4, column 5 ('2')\n\nSo, neighbors are:\n\n- row 2, column 3: '2'\n\n- row 2, column 4: '1'\n\n- row 2, column 5: '.'\n\n- row 3, column 3: '2'\n\n- row 3, column 5: '1'\n\n- row 4, column 3: '_'\n\n- row 4, column 4: '2'\n\n- row 4, column 5: '2'\n\nNone are flagged.\n\nThe '3' needs three bombs in these neighbors.\n\nBut these neighbors include multiple numbers, so it's hard to determine exactly where the bombs are without more information.\n\nThis seems too vague to make a decision.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that placing a flag on row 2, column 5, which is unexplored, might help satisfy the '3'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal row 2, column 5 to get more information.\n\nBut that carries the risk of hitting a bomb.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the safer move is to reveal row 0, column 0, as it's in an unexplored area with no adjacent numbers indicating potential bombs.\n\nSo, I'll go with revealing row 0, column 0.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed in this Minesweeper game, the next step is to reveal a safe square that doesn't pose an immediate risk based on the current board state. Given the board's layout and the information available, the best move is to reveal the square at position (0,0). This position is in an unexplored area with no adjacent numbers indicating potential bombs, making it a safe choice to gather more information without risking hitting a mine.\n\n**MOVE: 0,0,false**", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n1 . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n2 . . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n7 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n8 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n9 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see that there's a 'F' at position (0,9), so that's where the flag is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. There are a lot of unrevealed squares, marked with '.', and some revealed numbers and empty spaces. I need to find a safe move or place a flag where there's probably a bomb.\n\nLet me start by looking at the revealed numbers and see if I can deduce anything about the locations of the bombs.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n0 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n\nSo, positions (0,0) to (0,3) are 1s, and (0,8) and (0,9) are 1 and F respectively.\n\nRow 1:\n\n1 2 . 1 _ 1 1 _ 1 1\n\nRow 2:\n\n2 . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 3:\n\n1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 4:\n\n_ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 5:\n\n_ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1\n\nRow 6:\n\n_ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 7:\n\n_ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 8:\n\n1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n\nRow 9:\n\n. 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nOkay, let's focus on row 0. Position (0,0) is a 1, which means there's one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). But (0,1) is also a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent to it, which could be shared with (0,0). Similarly, (1,0) is a 2, which has two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nWait, position (1,0) is a 2. Let's see its adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). Among these, (0,0) and (0,1) are both 1s, and (1,1) is '.', (2,0) is '.', and (2,1) is '.'.\n\nSo, for (1,0) which is a 2, there should be two bombs in these five adjacent squares. But currently, none of them are flagged except for (0,9), which is far away. So, probably, there are two bombs among (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), and (2,1).\n\nBut (0,0) and (0,1) are both 1s, which means each has only one bomb adjacent to it. So, if we assume that (0,0) and (0,1) each have one bomb, but they share one bomb, which could be in (1,0) or (1,1). Wait, no, (1,0) is revealed as a 2, so it's not a bomb.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's look at position (0,3), which is a 1, and its adjacent squares are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4). But (0,2) is a 1, (0,4) is '_', (1,2) is '.', (1,3) is '_', and (1,4) is '1'.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a place where I can be certain about a bomb's location.\n\nLet me scroll down to row 3:\n\n1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n\nPosition (3,4) is a 3, which means there are three bombs adjacent to it. Its adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5).\n\nLooking at these squares:\n\n- (2,3): 1\n\n- (2,4): 2\n\n- (2,5): '.'\n\n- (3,3): '.'\n\n- (3,5): 1\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\n- (4,4): '_'\n\n- (4,5): '_'\n\nSo, among these, (2,3) is a 1, (2,4) is a 2, (3,5) is a 1, and the rest are either '.' or '_'.\n\nWait, (2,3) is a 1, which has adjacent squares: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).\n\nBut this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the number of remaining flags and the possible bomb locations.\n\nThere are 9 flags remaining, and there are 10 bombs in total, meaning one bomb has already been flagged at (0,9).\n\nI need to find the locations of the remaining 9 bombs.\n\nLooking at the board, there are many unrevealed squares, so it's not immediately obvious.\n\nPerhaps I should look for areas where the number of possible bomb locations matches the number of remaining flags.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for squares that are definitely safe to reveal.\n\nLet me look at row 6:\n\n_ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nPosition (6,4) is a 1, with adjacent squares: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5).\n\nBut many of these are '_', so it's not clear.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the bottom part of the board.\n\nRow 8:\n\n1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n\nPosition (8,0) is a 1, adjacent to (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1).\n\n(7,0): '_', (7,1): '_', (8,1): '_', (9,0): '.', (9,1): '1'.\n\nSo, position (9,1) is a 1, which has adjacent squares: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,0), but since it's a 10x10 board, (10,0) doesn't exist.\n\nSo, for (9,1), which is a 1, there should be one bomb in its adjacent squares: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2).\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (8,0): 1\n\n- (8,1): '_'\n\n- (8,2): '_'\n\n- (9,0): '.'\n\n- (9,2): '.'\n\nSo, for (9,1) being a 1, there should be one bomb among these five squares.\n\nNow, (8,0) is a 1, which already has one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to find a square that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n2 . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n\nPosition (2,0) is a 2, adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\n\n(1,0) is a 2, (1,1) is '.', (1,2) is '.', (2,1) is '.', (2,2) is 2, (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 1, (3,2) is 2.\n\nSo, for (2,0) being a 2, with adjacent squares, some are revealed and some are not.\n\nThis seems complex.\n\nMaybe I should consider the perimeter of the revealed area and see if I can find a safe square there.\n\nLooking at row 4:\n\n_ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n\nPosition (4,2) is a 2, adjacent to (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n\n(3,1) is 1, (3,2) is '.', (3,3) is '.', (4,1) is '_', (4,3) is '_', (5,1) is '_', (5,2) is 2, (5,3) is '_'.\n\nSo, for (4,2) being a 2, there should be two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, position (4,4) is a 2, adjacent to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\n(3,3): '.', (3,4): 3, (3,5): 1, (4,3): '_', (4,5): '_', (5,3): '_', (5,4): '_', (5,5): '_'.\n\nSo, for (4,4) being a 2, there should be two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nThis is still not giving me a clear indication of where to place a flag or reveal a safe square.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, which can help me deduce if it's a bomb or not.\n\nLooking at position (2,4), which is a 2, adjacent to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).\n\n(1,3): '_', (1,4): '1', (1,5): '1', (2,3): '1', (2,5): '.', (3,3): '.', (3,4): '.', (3,5): '1'.\n\nSo, for (2,4) being a 2, with these adjacent squares, perhaps I can find out where the bombs are.\n\nPosition (2,4) is a 2, and adjacent to it are:\n\n- (1,3): '_', potentially a bomb\n\n- (1,4): '1', which has one bomb adjacent to it\n\n- (1,5): '1', which has one bomb adjacent to it\n\n- (2,3): '1', which has one bomb adjacent to it\n\n- (2,5): '.', unrevealed\n\n- (3,3): '.', unrevealed\n\n- (3,4): '.', unrevealed\n\n- (3,5): '1', which has one bomb adjacent to it\n\nThis seems too vague.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possibility of placing a flag in one of the unrevealed squares adjacent to multiple numbers.\n\nLooking at position (3,3), which is '.', and adjacent to:\n\n- (2,2): '2'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '2'\n\n- (3,2): '2'\n\n- (3,4): '.'\n\n- (4,2): '2'\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\nSo, position (3,3) is adjacent to multiple numbers, which might help in deducing if it's a bomb or not.\n\nBut without more information, it's still unclear.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the total number of remaining bombs and flags.\n\nThere are 9 flags remaining and presumably 9 bombs left to flag.\n\nI need to make sure that the flags are placed in squares that are likely to be bombs.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for a square that, if revealed, wouldn't cause me to lose the game, based on the current numbers.\n\nLooking at position (6,2), which is a '1', adjacent to (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3).\n\n(5,1): '_', (5,2): '_', (5,3): '_', (6,1): '_', (6,3): '_', (7,1): '_', (7,2): '1', (7,3): '1'.\n\nSo, for (6,2) being a '1', there should be one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut all adjacent squares are either '_' or '1's which are already revealed.\n\nThis doesn't give me much information.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possibility of revealing a square that is adjacent to multiple '1's, assuming it's safe.\n\nFor example, position (7,2) is a '1', adjacent to (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3).\n\n(6,1): '_', (6,2): '1', (6,3): '_', (7,1): '_', (7,3): '1', (8,1): '_', (8,2): '_', (8,3): '_'.\n\nSo, for (7,2) being a '1', there should be one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nIf I look at position (7,3), which is a '1', adjacent to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4).\n\n(6,2): '1', (6,3): '_', (6,4): '_', (7,2): '1', (7,4): '1', (8,2): '_', (8,3): '_', (8,4): '_'.\n\nSo, for (7,3) being a '1', there should be one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nThis seems like a cluster of '1's, and it might be safe to reveal a square here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a square that is adjacent to a higher number, which would give me more constraints.\n\nLooking back at position (3,4), which is a '3', adjacent to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\n(2,3): '1', (2,4): '2', (2,5): '.', (3,3): '.', (3,5): '1', (4,3): '_', (4,4): '_', (4,5): '_'.\n\nSo, for (3,4) being a '3', there should be three bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nGiven that (2,3) is a '1', which should have one bomb adjacent to it, and (2,4) is a '2', which should have two bombs adjacent to it, and (3,5) is a '1', which should have one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for me to deduce anything concrete.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possibility of revealing a square that is adjacent to multiple '1's and see if it's safe.\n\nLooking at position (5,6), which is '_', adjacent to (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7).\n\nBut many of these are '_', so it doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a square that is the only possible location for a bomb based on the numbers around it.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has only one adjacent unrevealed square, then that square must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at position (0,8), which is a '1', adjacent to (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9).\n\n(0,7): '_', (0,9): 'F', (1,7): '_', (1,8): '1', (1,9): '1'.\n\nSo, for (0,8) being a '1', with adjacent squares, and one of them is already flagged as a bomb at (0,9), but (0,9) is a 'F', which is already counted as a flag.\n\nWait, (0,9) is a 'F', which is a flagged square, so it's considered a bomb.\n\nSo, for (0,8) being a '1', and (0,9) is a flagged bomb, that satisfies the '1'.\n\nTherefore, the other adjacent squares: (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) are all safe.\n\nWait, but (1,8) is a '1', which is already revealed, and (1,9) is a '1', which is also revealed.\n\nSo, perhaps (0,7) and (1,7) are safe to reveal.\n\nLet me check position (0,7), which is '_', adjacent to (0,6), (0,8), (0,9), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8).\n\n(0,6): '_', (0,8): '1', (0,9): 'F', (1,6): '_', (1,7): '_', (1,8): '1', (2,6): '_', (2,7): '_', (2,8): '_'.\n\nGiven that (0,8) is a '1' and (0,9) is a flagged bomb, and assuming that's the only bomb adjacent to (0,8), then (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) should be safe.\n\nBut (1,8) and (1,9) are already revealed as '1's, so perhaps (0,7) and (1,7) are safe to reveal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (0,7).\n\nBut to be cautious, perhaps I should reveal (1,7) instead, since it's adjacent to more revealed numbers.\n\nLooking at position (1,7), which is '_', adjacent to (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (1,9), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8).\n\n(0,6): '_', (0,7): '_', (0,8): '1', (1,6): '_', (1,8): '1', (1,9): '1', (2,6): '_', (2,7): '_', (2,8): '_'.\n\nGiven that (1,8) is a '1' and (1,9) is a '1', and (0,8) is a '1' with a flagged bomb at (0,9), perhaps (1,7) is safe to reveal.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no conflicting indications.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the possibility of using the total number of remaining bombs and flags.\n\nThere are 9 flags remaining and 9 bombs left to flag.\n\nI need to place these flags in squares that are likely to be bombs.\n\nLooking at the board, there are many '_' and '.' squares, so I need to find the ones that are most likely to be bombs.\n\nPerhaps I should look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, indicating a higher probability of being a bomb.\n\nFor example, position (3,3), which is '.', adjacent to (2,2): '2', (2,3): '1', (2,4): '2', (3,2): '2', (3,4): '.', (4,2): '2', (4,3): '_', (4,4): '_'.\n\nWith so many adjacent numbers, it's likely that this square contains a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, position (4,3), which is '_', adjacent to (3,2): '2', (3,3): '.', (3,4): '.', (4,2): '2', (4,4): '_', (5,2): '2', (5,3): '_', (5,4): '_'.\n\nAgain, multiple adjacent numbers suggesting it might be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, position (2,5), which is '.', adjacent to (1,4): '1', (1,5): '1', (1,6): '_', (2,4): '2', (2,6): '_', (3,4): '.', (3,5): '1', (3,6): '_'.\n\nMultiple adjacent numbers, so likely a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, position (3,6), which is '_', adjacent to (2,5): '.', (2,6): '_', (2,7): '_', (3,5): '1', (3,7): '_', (4,5): '_', (4,6): '_', (4,7): '_'.\n\nAgain, adjacent to a '1', so possible bomb.\n\nThis is getting too speculative.\n\nMaybe I should consider revealing a square that is less likely to be a bomb, based on the numbers around it.\n\nFor example, position (6,6), which is '_', adjacent to (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nAll of these are '_', so it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, position (8,6), which is '_', adjacent to (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7).\n\nAgain, all '_' or '.', so no clear indication.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a square that, when revealed, would give me more information about multiple areas.\n\nFor example, position (4,4), which is a '2', adjacent to (3,3): '.', (3,4): '.', (3,5): '1', (4,3): '_', (4,5): '_', (5,3): '_', (5,4): '_', (5,5): '_'.\n\nSo, revealing a square adjacent to this '2' could provide more clues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place a flag in a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers that suggest it's a bomb.\n\nLooking back at position (3,3), which is '.', adjacent to multiple '2's and a '3', it's likely a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, position (4,3), which is '_', adjacent to '2's, likely a bomb.\n\nPerhaps I should place a flag at (3,3).\n\nBut I only have 9 flags left, and I need to be careful not to place flags incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a square that seems safe based on the numbers around it.\n\nLooking at position (6,7), which is '_', adjacent to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8).\n\nAll of these are '_', so it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, position (7,4), which is a '1', adjacent to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5).\n\n(6,3): '_', (6,4): '_', (6,5): '_', (7,3): '1', (7,5): '1', (8,3): '_', (8,4): '_', (8,5): '_'.\n\nSo, for (7,4) being a '1', there should be one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nGiven that (7,3) and (7,5) are '1's, which already have their adjacent bombs accounted for, perhaps the bomb for (7,4) is in one of the '_' squares.\n\nBut without more information, it's unclear.\n\nThis is getting too tricky. Maybe I should just pick a square that seems safe and reveal it.\n\nLooking at position (1,7), which is '_', adjacent to (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (1,9), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8).\n\nGiven that (0,8) is a '1' with a flagged bomb at (0,9), and (1,8) and (1,9) are '1's, perhaps (1,7) is safe.\n\nI'll go with that.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the adjacency of (1,7) to revealed numbers and considering the flagged bomb at (0,9), it seems safe to reveal this square.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,7,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n1 2 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n2 . . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n7 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n8 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n9 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 2, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see that there's a 'F' at position (0,9), so that's where the flag is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. There are a lot of unrevealed squares, marked with '.', and some revealed numbers and empty spaces. I need to find a safe move or place a flag where there's probably a bomb.\n\nLet me start by looking at the revealed numbers and see if I can deduce anything about the locations of the bombs.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n0 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n\nSo, positions (0,0) to (0,3) are 1s, and (0,8) and (0,9) are 1 and F respectively.\n\nRow 1:\n\n1 2 . 1 _ 1 1 _ 1 1\n\nRow 2:\n\n2 . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 3:\n\n1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 4:\n\n_ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 5:\n\n_ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1\n\nRow 6:\n\n_ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 7:\n\n_ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 8:\n\n1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n\nRow 9:\n\n. 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nOkay, let's focus on row 0. Position (0,0) is a 1, which means there's one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). But (0,1) is also a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent to it, which could be shared with (0,0). Similarly, (1,0) is a 2, which has two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nWait, position (1,0) is a 2. Let's see its adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). Among these, (0,0) and (0,1) are both 1s, and (1,1) is '.', (2,0) is '.', and (2,1) is '.'.\n\nSo, for (1,0) being a 2, there should be two bombs in these five adjacent squares. But currently, none of them are flagged. However, position (0,9) is flagged, but that's far away from here.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for areas where the number of flags matches the number indicated.\n\nLooking at position (0,8), which is a 1, and (0,9) is flagged. So, for (0,8), which has adjacent squares: (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). Assuming (0,7) is '_', (1,7) is '_', (1,8) is 1, and (1,9) is 1. So, only (1,9) is a 1, and (0,9) is flagged. So, does that satisfy the '1' at (0,8)? Yes, because it has one flag adjacent to it.\n\nSimilarly, position (1,9) is a 1, and it's adjacent to (0,9) which is flagged, so that should be fine.\n\nNow, looking at position (1,0), which is a 2, and it has no adjacent flags. But its adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). None of these are flagged. But we have one flag already placed at (0,9), which is not adjacent to (1,0). So, I need to place two flags in the adjacent squares of (1,0).\n\nBut wait, I only have 9 flags left, and there are 10 bombs in total. So, one bomb is already flagged.\n\nWait, no. Flags remaining are 9, and bombs are 10, so either one bomb is already revealed (which would be a mistake), or perhaps one flag is already placed, which seems to be the case at (0,9).\n\nBut in the board state, it shows 'F' at (0,9), which is a flag. So, flags remaining are 9, and bombs are 10, meaning that one bomb is already flagged.\n\nSo, I need to place 9 more flags to mark the remaining 9 bombs.\n\nLooking back at position (1,0), which is a 2, and has no adjacent flags, I need to place two flags in its adjacent squares.\n\nBut all its adjacent squares are either numbers or '.', so I need to decide where to place those flags.\n\nWait, position (1,0) is a 2, and its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,0): 1\n\n- (0,1): 1\n\n- (1,1): .\n\n- (2,0): .\n\n- (2,1): .\n\nNow, (0,0) and (0,1) are both 1s, which might already have their adjacent bombs accounted for.\n\nWait, position (0,0) is a 1, and its adjacent squares are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Similarly, (0,1) is a 1, adjacent to (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1).\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should look for areas where the number of unknowns matches the number needed to satisfy the bomb count.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n2 . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n\nPosition (2,0) is 2, adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, position (2,2) is 2, adjacent to (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nAnd position (2,6) is 1, adjacent to (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,6), (3,7).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should look at position (3,4), which is a 3.\n\nPosition (3,4) is 3, adjacent to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nLooking at its adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,3): 1\n\n- (2,4): 2\n\n- (2,5): .\n\n- (3,3): .\n\n- (3,5): 1\n\n- (4,3): .\n\n- (4,4): .\n\n- (4,5): .\n\nSo, position (3,4) is 3, and it has these adjacent squares with some numbers.\n\nI need to see how many bombs are already accounted for in these adjacents.\n\nPosition (2,3) is 1, which should have one bomb adjacent to it. Position (2,4) is 2, needing two bombs adjacent. Position (2,5) is '.', unknown. Position (3,3) is '.', unknown. Position (3,5) is 1, needing one bomb adjacent. Position (4,3) is '.', unknown. Position (4,4) is '.', unknown. Position (4,5) is '.'.\n\nThis seems a bit too vague. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me try to look for areas where the number of unknowns equals the number of remaining bombs needed.\n\nLooking at position (1,0) which is a 2, and its adjacent unknowns are (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). So, three unknowns for two bombs. That means one of them is safe.\n\nBut, position (2,0) is a '.', and position (2,1) is '.', and (1,1) is '.'.\n\nSo, two of these three are bombs. I can't directly deduce which ones are safe.\n\nMaybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at position (0,3), which is a 1, adjacent to (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3). Position (0,2) is a 1, position (0,4) is '_', position (1,2) is '.', position (1,3) is '_'.\n\nSo, position (0,3) is a 1, and it has one bomb in these four adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, position (0,2) is a 1, adjacent to (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2). So, it also needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nMaybe I should look for a row or column that has a clear pattern.\n\nLooking at column 9:\n\nPosition (0,9): F\n\nPosition (1,9): 1\n\nPosition (5,9): 1\n\nPosition (6,9): 1\n\nPosition (7,9): 1\n\nPosition (8,9): 1\n\nPosition (9,9): .\n\nSo, in column 9, there are several 1s and a flagged square.\n\nLooking at position (1,9): 1, adjacent to (0,9) which is flagged, and (2,9): '_', (1,8): 1.\n\nSo, position (1,9) is a 1, and it's adjacent to the flagged square, so no more bombs adjacent to it.\n\nSimilarly, position (5,9): 1, adjacent to (4,9): '_', (5,8): '_', (6,9): 1, (6,8): '_'.\n\nPosition (6,9): 1, adjacent to (5,9), (5,8), (7,9):1, (7,8):'_'.\n\nPosition (7,9):1, adjacent to (6,9), (6,8), (8,9):1, (8,8):'_'.\n\nPosition (8,9):1, adjacent to (7,9), (7,8), (9,9):'.\n\nSo, in column 9, there are several 1s, and some adjacent squares are still unknown.\n\nMaybe I can try to see if I can safely reveal some squares in column 9.\n\nLooking at position (4,9): '_', which is adjacent to (3,9): '_', (3,8): '_', (4,8): '_', (5,9):1, (5,8):'_'.\n\nPosition (5,9):1, adjacent to (4,9), (4,8), (6,9):1, (6,8):'_'.\n\nPosition (6,9):1, adjacent to (5,9), (5,8), (7,9):1, (7,8):'_'.\n\nPosition (7,9):1, adjacent to (6,9), (6,8), (8,9):1, (8,8):'_'.\n\nPosition (8,9):1, adjacent to (7,9), (7,8), (9,9):'.\n\nSo, positions (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9) have various adjacencies.\n\nWait, position (5,9) is a 1, and it's adjacent to (4,9), (4,8), (6,9), (6,8).\n\nSimilarly, position (6,9) is a 1, adjacent to (5,9), (5,8), (7,9), (7,8).\n\nPosition (7,9) is a 1, adjacent to (6,9), (6,8), (8,9), (8,8).\n\nPosition (8,9) is a 1, adjacent to (7,9), (7,8), (9,9).\n\nLooking at this chain, it seems like there are overlapping adjacent squares.\n\nLet me try to see if I can find a way to place flags here.\n\nAssuming that position (5,9) is a 1, and it has one bomb in its adjacent squares: (4,9), (4,8), (6,9), (6,8).\n\nSimilarly, position (6,9) is a 1, with one bomb in its adjacent squares: (5,9), (5,8), (7,9), (7,8).\n\nPosition (7,9) is a 1, with one bomb in its adjacent squares: (6,9), (6,8), (8,9), (8,8).\n\nPosition (8,9) is a 1, with one bomb in its adjacent squares: (7,9), (7,8), (9,9).\n\nNow, considering that position (5,9) is a 1 and position (6,9) is a 1, and they share adjacent squares, I need to see if I can deduce the positions of the bombs.\n\nLet me consider the squares (5,8), (6,8), and (7,8), which are all adjacent to multiple 1s.\n\nIf I assume that (6,8) is a bomb, then it would satisfy the 1s at (5,9) and (6,9). But then, position (7,9) would still need another bomb in its adjacent squares, which could be (8,9) or (7,8).\n\nBut position (8,9) is a 1, adjacent to (7,9) and (9,9). If I place a bomb in (8,9), it would satisfy position (8,9)'s need for one bomb adjacent, but then position (7,9) would have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts its value of 1.\n\nTherefore, (8,9) cannot be a bomb. So, if (6,8) is a bomb, then position (7,9) would have (6,8) as its bomb, and position (8,9) would need another bomb adjacent, but (8,9) is a 1, and (7,9) already has (6,8), so perhaps (7,8) is a bomb.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me look at position (4,9): '_'. Its adjacent squares are (3,9): '_', (3,8): '_', (4,8): '_', (5,9):1, (5,8):'_'.\n\nPosition (5,9):1, adjacent to (4,9), (4,8), (6,9):1, (6,8):'_'.\n\nSo, position (5,9) is a 1, and it has one bomb in its adjacent squares: (4,9), (4,8), (6,9), (6,8).\n\nSimilarly, position (6,9) is a 1, adjacent to (5,9), (5,8), (7,9):1, (7,8):'_'.\n\nPosition (7,9) is a 1, adjacent to (6,9), (6,8), (8,9):1, (8,8):'_'.\n\nPosition (8,9) is a 1, adjacent to (7,9), (7,8), (9,9):'.\n\nSo, perhaps I can consider the chain starting from position (5,9).\n\nPosition (5,9) is a 1, and it has adjacent squares: (4,9), (4,8), (6,9), (6,8).\n\nSimilarly, position (6,9) is a 1, adjacent to (5,9), (5,8), (7,9), (7,8).\n\nPosition (7,9) is a 1, adjacent to (6,9), (6,8), (8,9), (8,8).\n\nPosition (8,9) is a 1, adjacent to (7,9), (7,8), (9,9).\n\nIf I consider that position (5,9) is a 1 and has one bomb in its adjacent squares, and position (6,9) is a 1 and has one bomb in its adjacent squares, then perhaps the bombs are placed in such a way that they satisfy both.\n\nLet me consider that (6,8) is a bomb. Then, it would satisfy both position (5,9) and position (6,9)'s need for one bomb adjacent.\n\nThen, position (7,9) would need another bomb adjacent, which could be either (7,8) or (8,9).\n\nBut position (8,9) is a 1, and if I place a bomb in (8,9), then position (7,9) would have two bombs adjacent, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, (8,9) cannot be a bomb. So, if (6,8) is a bomb, then position (7,9) would need another bomb in (7,8).\n\nBut position (7,8) is adjacent to position (8,9), which is a 1. If I place a bomb in (7,8), then position (8,9) would have one bomb adjacent, which is fine.\n\nSo, in this scenario, (6,8) and (7,8) are bombs.\n\nBut wait, position (7,9) is adjacent to (6,8) and (7,8), which are both bombs, but position (7,9) is a 1, which indicates only one adjacent bomb. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, my assumption that (6,8) is a bomb must be wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps (6,8) is not a bomb. Then, position (5,9) and position (6,9) each need one bomb in their adjacent squares.\n\nIf (6,8) is not a bomb, then position (5,9) must have its bomb in either (4,9) or (4,8), and position (6,9) must have its bomb in either (5,8) or (7,9).\n\nBut position (7,9) is a 1, and if position (6,9) has its bomb in (7,9), then position (7,9) would have its bomb accounted for.\n\nSimilarly, position (7,9) is adjacent to position (8,9), which is a 1, and position (8,9) would need its own bomb adjacent, which could be (9,9).\n\nBut position (9,9) is '.', unknown.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different area of the board.\n\nLet me look at position (2,0), which is a 2, adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1).\n\nPosition (1,0) is a 2, adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nPosition (3,0) is a 1, adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1).\n\nPosition (4,0) is '_', adjacent to (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1).\n\nPosition (5,0) is '_', adjacent to (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1).\n\nPosition (6,0) is '_', adjacent to (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1).\n\nPosition (7,0) is '_', adjacent to (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1).\n\nPosition (8,0) is '1', adjacent to (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1).\n\nPosition (9,0) is '.', adjacent to (8,0), (8,1), (9,1).\n\nOkay, this seems like a different section of the board.\n\nLooking at position (8,0), which is a 1, adjacent to (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1).\n\nCurrently, none of these adjacent squares are flagged.\n\nSo, position (8,0) is a 1, meaning one of these five adjacent squares has a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, position (9,0) is '.', unknown.\n\nPosition (8,1) is '_', adjacent to (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (9,1), (9,2).\n\nPosition (9,1) is '.', adjacent to (8,1), (8,2), (9,2).\n\nSo, in this area, there are several unknown squares.\n\nMaybe I can try to reveal position (4,0), which is '_', and see what happens.\n\nBut before doing that, I should check if there's any safer move.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place a flag in one of the unknown squares if I can deduce it's a bomb.\n\nLooking back at position (1,0), which is a 2, adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nPosition (0,0) is a 1, position (0,1) is a 1, position (1,1) is '.', position (2,0) is '.', position (2,1) is '.'.\n\nSo, position (1,0) is a 2, and it needs two bombs in these five adjacent squares.\n\nPosition (0,0) is a 1, which needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nPosition (0,1) is a 1, which needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nPosition (2,0) is '.', position (2,1) is '.', position (1,1) is '.'.\n\nThis seems too vague to make a decision.\n\nMaybe I should consider the big picture.\n\nThere are 10 bombs in total, and 9 flags remaining, meaning one bomb is already flagged at (0,9).\n\nSo, there are 9 bombs left to be flagged.\n\nLooking at the board, there are many unknown squares, so I need to be careful.\n\nPerhaps I should try to reveal a square that is less likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at position (9,9), which is '.', and it's adjacent to position (8,9), which is a 1.\n\nPosition (8,9) is a 1, adjacent to (7,9):1, (7,8):'_', (9,9):'.\n\nSo, position (8,9) is a 1, and it has one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nThe adjacent squares are (7,9), (7,8), and (9,9).\n\nPosition (7,9) is a 1, which should have one bomb adjacent.\n\nIf I assume that (9,9) is a bomb, then position (8,9) would have its bomb accounted for.\n\nBut then, position (7,9) would need another bomb adjacent, which could be in (7,8).\n\nBut position (7,8) is adjacent to position (8,9), which is already having one bomb adjacent.\n\nThis seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (9,9) is not a bomb, and the bomb is in (7,8).\n\nThen, position (8,9) would have its bomb in (7,8), and position (7,9) would have its bomb in (7,8) as well, but position (7,9) is a 1, which cannot have two adjacent bombs.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should try to look for a different area.\n\nLooking at position (2,6), which is a 1, adjacent to (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,6), (3,7).\n\nPosition (1,6) is a 1, position (1,7) is '_', position (2,7) is '_', position (3,6) is '_', position (3,7) is '.'.\n\nSo, position (2,6) is a 1, needing one bomb in these five adjacent squares.\n\nPosition (1,6) is a 1, which needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nPosition (1,7) is '_', position (2,7) is '_', position (3,6) is '_', position (3,7) is '.'.\n\nThis seems too vague again.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability and pick a square that is less likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at position (9,2), which is '.', adjacent to (8,1):1, (8,2):'_', (9,1):'_'.\n\nPosition (8,1) is a 1, adjacent to (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (9,1), (9,2).\n\nSo, position (8,1) is a 1, needing one bomb adjacent.\n\nIts adjacent squares are (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (9,1), (9,2).\n\nIf I consider that one of these five squares has a bomb, and I have to choose one to flag.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to be certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reveal position (9,2) and see what happens.\n\nBut that might be risky.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square that, when revealed, can give me more information.\n\nLooking at position (4,2), which is '_', adjacent to (3,1):'.', (3,2):'.', (4,1):'_', (4,3):'_', (5,2):'_'.\n\nPosition (3,1) is '.', position (3,2) is '.', position (4,1) is '_', position (4,3) is '_', position (5,2) is '.'.\n\nThis seems unclear as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at position (2,2), which is a 2, adjacent to (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nPosition (1,2) is '.', position (1,3) is '_', position (2,3) is '1', position (3,2) is '.', position (3,3) is '.'.\n\nSo, position (2,2) is a 2, needing two bombs in these five adjacent squares.\n\nPosition (2,3) is a 1, needing one bomb adjacent.\n\nIts adjacent squares are (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4).\n\nWait, position (2,3) is a 1, and it's adjacent to position (2,2), which is a 2.\n\nThis seems like another complex chain.\n\nI'm not making much progress here.\n\nMaybe I should consider the top part of the board again.\n\nLooking at position (0,3), which is a 1, adjacent to (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nPosition (0,2) is a 1, position (0,4) is '_', position (1,2) is '.', position (1,3) is '_'.\n\nSo, position (0,3) is a 1, needing one bomb adjacent.\n\nPosition (0,2) is a 1, needing one bomb adjacent.\n\nPosition (1,2) is '.', position (1,3) is '_'.\n\nThis seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that position (0,4) is '_', and reveal it.\n\nBut before doing that, I should check if it's safe.\n\nPosition (0,4) is adjacent to position (0,3), which is a 1, and position (1,3):'_', position (1,4):'_', position (2,4):'2', position (2,3):'1'.\n\nSo, position (0,4) is adjacent to position (2,4), which is a 2, and position (2,3), which is a 1.\n\nIf I reveal position (0,4), and it's a bomb, that would be bad.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place a flag there if I can deduce it's a bomb.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to be sure.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should look for a square where the number of adjacent unknowns equals the number of bombs needed.\n\nLooking at position (3,4), which is a 3, adjacent to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nPosition (2,3) is '1', position (2,4) is '2', position (2,5) is '.', position (3,3) is '.', position (3,5) is '1', position (4,3) is '.', position (4,4) is '.', position (4,5) is '.'.\n\nSo, position (3,4) is a 3, and it has these adjacent squares with some numbers and unknowns.\n\nPosition (2,3) is '1', which needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nPosition (2,4) is '2', needing two bombs adjacent.\n\nPosition (2,5) is '.', position (3,3) is '.', position (3,5) is '1', position (4,3) is '.', position (4,4) is '.', position (4,5) is '.'.\n\nThis seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider that position (3,4) is a 3, and it has eight adjacent squares, three of which are bombs.\n\nBut I don't know which ones.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should make a move based on probability.\n\nLooking at the board, position (9,2) seems like a reasonable choice to reveal, as it's in an area with some revealed numbers that might give me more information.\n\nSo, I'll choose to reveal position (9,2).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Position (9,2) is adjacent to position (8,1), which is a 1, and position (9,1), which is unknown. Revealing this square could provide more information about the bomb locations in this area.\n\n**MOVE:** 9,2,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n1 2 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n2 . . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n7 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n8 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n9 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 1, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see that there's a 'F' at position (0,9), so that's where the flag is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. There are a lot of unrevealed squares, marked with '.', and some revealed numbers and empty spaces. I need to find a safe move or place a flag where there's probably a bomb.\n\nLet me start by looking at the revealed numbers and see if I can deduce anything about the locations of the bombs.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n0 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n\nSo, positions (0,0) to (0,3) are 1s, and (0,8) and (0,9) are 1 and F respectively.\n\nRow 1:\n\n1 2 . 1 _ 1 1 _ 1 1\n\nRow 2:\n\n2 . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 3:\n\n1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 4:\n\n_ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 5:\n\n_ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1\n\nRow 6:\n\n_ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 7:\n\n_ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 8:\n\n1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n\nRow 9:\n\n. 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nOkay, let's focus on row 0. Position (0,0) is a 1, which means there's one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). But (0,1) is also a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent to it, which could be shared with (0,0). Similarly, (1,0) is a 2, which has two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nWait, position (1,0) is a 2. Let's see its adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). Among these, (0,0) and (0,1) are both 1s, and (1,1) is '.', (2,0) is '.', and (2,1) is '.'.\n\nSo, for (1,0) which is a 2, there should be two bombs in these five adjacent squares. But currently, none of them are flagged except for (0,9), which is far away. So, probably, there are two bombs among (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), and (2,1).\n\nBut (0,0) and (0,1) are both 1s, which means each has only one bomb adjacent to it. So, if we assume that (0,0) and (0,1) each have one bomb, but they share one bomb, which could be in (1,0) or (1,1). Wait, no, (1,0) is revealed as a 2, so it's not a bomb.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's look at position (0,3), which is a 1, and its adjacent squares are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4). But (0,2) is a 1, (0,4) is '_', (1,2) is '.', (1,3) is '_', and (1,4) is '1'.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a place where I can be certain about a bomb's location.\n\nLet me scroll down to row 3:\n\n1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n\nPosition (3,4) is a 3, which means there are three bombs adjacent to it. Its adjacent squares are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5).\n\nLooking at these squares:\n\n- (2,3): 1\n\n- (2,4): 2\n\n- (2,5): '.'\n\n- (3,3): '.'\n\n- (3,5): 1\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\n- (4,4): '_'\n\n- (4,5): '_'\n\nSo, among these, (2,3) is a 1, (2,4) is a 2, (3,5) is a 1, and the rest are either '.' or '_'.\n\nWait, (2,3) is a 1, which has adjacent squares: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).\n\nBut this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the number of remaining flags and the possible bomb locations.\n\nThere are 9 flags remaining, and there are 10 bombs in total, meaning one bomb has already been flagged at (0,9).\n\nI need to find the locations of the remaining 9 bombs.\n\nLooking at the board, there are many unrevealed squares, so it's not immediately obvious.\n\nPerhaps I should look for areas where the number of possible bomb locations matches the number of remaining flags.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for squares that are definitely safe to reveal.\n\nLet me look at row 6:\n\n_ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nPosition (6,4) is a 1, with adjacent squares: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5).\n\nBut many of these are '_', so it's not clear.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the bottom part of the board.\n\nRow 8:\n\n1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n\nPosition (8,0) is a 1, adjacent to (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1).\n\n(7,0): '_', (7,1): '_', (8,1): '_', (9,0): '.', (9,1): '1'.\n\nSo, position (9,1) is a 1, which has adjacent squares: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,0), but since it's a 10x10 board, (10,0) doesn't exist.\n\nSo, for (9,1), which is a 1, there should be one bomb in its adjacent squares: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2).\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (8,0): 1\n\n- (8,1): '_'\n\n- (8,2): '_'\n\n- (9,0): '.'\n\n- (9,2): '.'\n\nSo, for (9,1) being a 1, there should be one bomb among these five squares.\n\nNow, (8,0) is a 1, which already has one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to find a square that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n2 . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n\nPosition (2,0) is a 2, adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\n\n(1,0) is 2, (1,1) is '.', (1,2) is '.', (2,1) is '.', (2,2) is 2, (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 1, (3,2) is 2.\n\nSo, for (2,0) being a 2, with adjacent squares, most of them are revealed except for some '.'s.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a square that has all its adjacent squares revealed except for one, and the number matches the flags.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has one adjacent flag, then the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nLooking at position (0,0): 1\n\nAdjacent squares: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n\n(0,1) is 1, (1,0) is 2, (1,1) is '.'\n\nSince (0,1) is 1 and (1,0) is 2, and neither is a bomb, then the bomb must be in (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) is '.', so maybe I should flag it.\n\nWait, but position (1,0) is 2, adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)\n\nIf (1,1) is a bomb, then (1,0) has two bombs adjacent: (0,0) and (1,1). But (0,0) is not a bomb, as it's revealed.\n\nWait, no, (0,0) is not a bomb, because it's revealed as a 1.\n\nSo, if (1,1) is a bomb, then (1,0) has one bomb adjacent: (1,1). But (1,0) is a 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent.\n\nSo, there must be another bomb adjacent to (1,0). The adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nSince (0,0) and (0,1) are not bombs, and (1,1) is a bomb, then there needs to be another bomb in (2,0) or (2,1).\n\nLooking at (2,0): '.', (2,1): '.'.\n\nSo, either (2,0) or (2,1) is a bomb.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine which one.\n\nMaybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet me look at position (3,4): 3\n\nAdjacent squares: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (2,3): 1\n\n- (2,4): 2\n\n- (2,5): '.'\n\n- (3,3): '.'\n\n- (3,5): 1\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\n- (4,4): '_'\n\n- (4,5): '_'\n\nSo, for (3,4) being a 3, there should be three bombs adjacent to it.\n\nLooking at the adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,3): 1, not a bomb\n\n- (2,4): 2, not a bomb\n\n- (2,5): '.'\n\n- (3,3): '.'\n\n- (3,5): 1, not a bomb\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\n- (4,4): '_'\n\n- (4,5): '_'\n\nSo, the possible bomb locations are (2,5), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nBut I need to have three bombs in these locations.\n\nBut I don't know which ones are bombs.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possibility of placing flags in some of these squares.\n\nBut before doing that, let's see if there are any squares that are definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 6:\n\n_ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nPosition (6,4) is a 1, adjacent to (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5).\n\nMost of these are '_', so it's not clear.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at position (6,8): 1\n\nAdjacent squares: (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (5,7): '_', (5,8): 1, (5,9): 1\n\n- (6,7): '_', (6,9): '.'\n\n- (7,7): '_', (7,8): 1, (7,9): '.'\n\nSo, for (6,8) being a 1, there should be one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at (5,8): 1, not a bomb\n\n(5,9): 1, not a bomb\n\n(6,9): '.', possible bomb\n\n(7,8): 1, not a bomb\n\nSo, the possible bomb locations are (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), and (7,9).\n\nBut (5,7) is '_', (6,7) is '_', (7,7) is '_', and (7,9) is '.'.\n\nSo, there should be one bomb among these four squares.\n\nBut I don't know which one it is.\n\nMaybe I can't conclude anything here.\n\nLet me look for another approach.\n\nI have 9 flags remaining and need to place them on the remaining bombs.\n\nI need to find squares that are likely to be bombs based on the numbers around them.\n\nLooking back at position (1,0): 2\n\nAdjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)\n\n(0,0): 1, not a bomb\n\n(0,1): 1, not a bomb\n\n(1,1): '.', possible bomb\n\n(2,0): '.', possible bomb\n\n(2,1): '.', possible bomb\n\nSo, for (1,0) being a 2, there should be two bombs in these five squares.\n\nBut (0,0) and (0,1) are not bombs, so the two bombs must be in (1,1), (2,0), or (2,1).\n\nBut I don't know which ones.\n\nSimilarly, position (2,0): 2\n\nAdjacent squares: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n(1,0): 2, not a bomb\n\n(1,1): '.', possible bomb\n\n(1,2): '.', possible bomb\n\n(2,1): '.', possible bomb\n\n(2,2): 2, not a bomb\n\n(3,0): 1, not a bomb\n\n(3,1): 1, not a bomb\n\n(3,2): 2, not a bomb\n\nSo, for (2,0) being a 2, the bombs must be in (1,1), (1,2), or (2,1).\n\nBut from position (1,0): 2, the bombs are in (1,1), (2,0), or (2,1).\n\nSo, combining these, it seems that (1,1) is a common square in both.\n\nMaybe I can try to see if (1,1) is definitely a bomb.\n\nIf (1,1) is a bomb, then for (1,0): 2, it would satisfy one bomb, needing one more in (2,0) or (2,1).\n\nFor (2,0): 2, if (1,1) is a bomb, then another bomb needs to be in (1,2) or (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is adjacent to both (1,0) and (2,0), so if (2,1) is a bomb, it satisfies both.\n\nAlternatively, if (1,2) is a bomb, then (2,0) would have only one bomb adjacent.\n\nWait, let's think carefully.\n\nIf (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs, then:\n\n- (1,0): adjacent to (1,1) and (2,1) \u2192 2 bombs, satisfied\n\n- (2,0): adjacent to (2,1) \u2192 1 bomb, but it needs 2 bombs\n\nWait, (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nIf (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs, then (2,0) is adjacent to (1,1) and (2,1), which are two bombs, so it's satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0) is adjacent to (1,1) and (2,1), which are two bombs, satisfied.\n\nSo, this is a possible configuration.\n\nAlternatively, if (1,1) and (1,2) are bombs:\n\n- (1,0): adjacent to (1,1) \u2192 1 bomb, but it needs 2 bombs \u2192 need another bomb adjacent to (1,0), which could be (2,0) or (2,1)\n\n- (2,0): adjacent to (1,1) and (2,1) \u2192 if (2,1) is not a bomb, then only one bomb adjacent, but it needs two \u2192 so (2,1) must be a bomb\n\nSo, in this case, (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1) are bombs.\n\nWait, but (2,0) would then be adjacent to (1,1) and (2,1), which are two bombs, satisfied.\n\n(1,0) is adjacent to (1,1) and (2,1), which are two bombs, satisfied.\n\nSo, both configurations are possible:\n\n1. (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs\n\n2. (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1) are bombs\n\nBut in both cases, (1,1) and (2,1) are bombs.\n\nSo, I can conclude that (2,1) is definitely a bomb.\n\nTherefore, I should place a flag at (2,1).\n\nWait, but in the second configuration, (1,2) is also a bomb.\n\nBut in both configurations, (2,1) is a bomb.\n\nSo, it's safe to flag (2,1).\n\nBut let me check again.\n\nIf I flag (2,1), then for (1,0): 2, it has (1,1) and (2,1) as bombs, satisfied.\n\nFor (2,0): 2, it has (1,1) and (2,1) as bombs, satisfied.\n\nSo, flagging (2,1) seems correct.\n\nTherefore, my next move is to place a flag at (2,1).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this Minesweeper puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the board state and make logical deductions to determine the safe moves or the locations of the bombs. Given the complexity of the board, we will focus on areas where the number of revealed squares and flags can help us make informed decisions.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze Revealed Numbers:** Look at the numbers on the board to determine how many adjacent squares contain bombs.\n2. **Check Adjacent Squares:** For each number, examine the adjacent squares to see which ones are flagged, revealed, or still hidden.\n3. **Deduce Bomb Locations:** Use the information from the numbers and adjacent squares to deduce the locations of the bombs.\n4. **Place Flags or Reveal Squares:** Based on the deductions, either place flags on suspected bomb locations or reveal squares that are likely safe.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a logical puzzle and not a coding problem, the \"solution code\" will be in the form of a move description.\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: After analyzing the board, particularly focusing on the numbers and their adjacent squares, it was deduced that position (2,1) is likely to contain a bomb. This conclusion was reached by examining the interactions between the numbers at positions (1,0) and (2,0), which both require a certain number of adjacent bombs, leading to the inference that (2,1) must be a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 2,1,true\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Position Analysis:** We looked at positions (1,0) and (2,0), which are both numbers indicating the count of adjacent bombs.\n- **Adjacent Squares:** By examining the adjacent squares of these positions, we identified that (2,1) is a common candidate for containing a bomb to satisfy both positions' requirements.\n- **Flag Placement:** Therefore, we decided to place a flag at position (2,1) to mark it as a bomb.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are making a logical and safe decision based on the current state of the board.", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n1 2 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n2 . . 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ 1 1\n6 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n7 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n8 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 .\n9 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}

So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total.

I have to decide based on the current information.\n\nLet's start by looking at the flagged squares. There's one at (0,9), and another at (2,1). Since flags are already placed, I need to ensure that these are indeed bombs.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- (0,0): 1\n\n- (0,1): 1\n\n- (0,2): 1\n\n- (0,8): 1\n\n- (0,9): F\n\nGiven that (0,9) is flagged, and (0,8) shows 1, which means there is exactly one bomb adjacent to it. Since (0,9) is flagged, that satisfies the 1. So, no other bombs should be adjacent to (0,8). Therefore, (1,8) and (1,9) should not be bombs.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n- (1,0): 2\n\n- (1,1): .\n\n- (1,2): 1\n\n- (1,4): 1\n\n- (1,5): 1\n\n- (1,6): 1\n\n- (1,8): 1\n\n- (1,9): 1\n\n(1,0) shows 2, and it's adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). But (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) are 1's, which are safe. (1,1) is unexplored, (2,0) is unexplored, (2,1) is flagged, and (2,2) is 2.\n\nSo, (1,0) is adjacent to (2,1) which is flagged, so that's one bomb. It needs another bomb adjacent to it. So, either (1,1), (2,0), or (2,2) is a bomb.\n\nBut (2,2) is a 2, which is adjacent to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (2,1) is flagged, so that's one bomb. It needs another bomb adjacent to it. So, possible bombs could be (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), etc.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at row 2:\n\n- (2,0): .\n\n- (2,1): F\n\n- (2,2): 2\n\n- (2,3): 1\n\n- (2,4): 2\n\n- (2,5): .\n\n- (2,6): 1\n\n- (2,7): _\n\n- (2,8): _\n\n- (2,9): _\n\n(2,1) is flagged, which should be a bomb.\n\n(2,2) is 2, adjacent to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).\n\n(2,1) is flagged, so that's one bomb. It needs another bomb adjacent to it. So, possible bombs are (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), etc.\n\nWait, (1,4) is 1, which is adjacent to (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,3), (1,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,5).\n\n(1,4) shows 1, and it's adjacent to (2,4) which is 2. But (2,4) is adjacent to (2,1) which is flagged. So, it's a bit confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look at row 3:\n\n- (3,0): 1\n\n- (3,1): 1\n\n- (3,2): 2\n\n- (3,3): .\n\n- (3,4): 3\n\n- (3,5): 1\n\n- (3,6): 1\n\n- (3,7): _\n\n- (3,8): _\n\n- (3,9): _\n\n(3,4) shows 3, which is adjacent to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,3), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\n(2,4) is 2, (2,5) is ., (2,6) is 1, (3,3) is ., (3,5) is 1, (4,4) is _, (4,5) is _, (4,6) is _.\n\nSince (3,4) is 3, and it's adjacent to (2,4) which is 2, and (2,4) is adjacent to (2,1) which is flagged, so that might be one bomb.\n\nBut this seems too convoluted. Maybe I should look for areas with fewer possibilities.\n\nLet's look at row 8:\n\n- (8,0): 1\n\n- (8,1): 1\n\n- (8,2): _\n\n- (8,3): _\n\n- (8,4): _\n\n- (8,5): _\n\n- (8,6): _\n\n- (8,7): _\n\n- (8,8): 1\n\n- (8,9): .\n\n(8,0): 1, adjacent to (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1), but some are unexplored.\n\n(8,1): 1, adjacent to (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (9,1), (9,2), but some are unexplored.\n\n(8,8): 1, adjacent to (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (9,8), (9,9), but some are unexplored.\n\n(8,9): ., unexplored.\n\nThis seems like a safer area to explore because there are fewer adjacent squares that are unexplored.\n\nLet's consider revealing (8,2). It's adjacent to (8,1), which is 1, and (8,3), which is _, and some others.\n\nWait, but (8,1) is 1, and it's adjacent to (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (9,1), (9,2).\n\nIf I reveal (8,2), and if it's safe, it might help me gather more information.\n\nBut before doing that, maybe I should check if there are any obvious safe squares or places where I can place flags.\n\nLooking back at row 1:\n\n(1,0): 2, adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2) are 1's, which are safe.\n\n(2,1) is flagged.\n\nSo, the two bombs adjacent to (1,0) are (2,1) and possibly one other square among (1,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is 2, which is adjacent to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).\n\n(2,1) is flagged, so (2,2) needs another bomb adjacent to it.\n\nLooking at (1,2): 1, adjacent to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n\n(0,2) is 1, safe; (0,4) is _, (1,1) is ., (1,3) is ., (2,2) is 2, (2,3) is ., (2,4) is 2.\n\nSo, (1,2) shows 1, and it's adjacent to (2,2) which is 2, and (2,1) which is flagged.\n\nWait, no, (2,1) is adjacent to (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), etc.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 6:\n\n(6,0): _, (6,1): _, (6,2): _, (6,3): ., (6,4): 1, (6,5): _, (6,6): _, (6,7): _, (6,8): 1, (6,9): .\n\n(6,4): 1, adjacent to (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,3), (6,5), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6).\n\n(5,4): 2, (5,5): 2, (5,6): _, (6,3): ., (6,5): _, (7,4): 1, (7,5): 1, (7,6): 1.\n\nSo, (6,4) shows 1, and it's adjacent to (5,4) which is 2, and (5,5) which is 2.\n\n(5,4): 2, adjacent to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,3), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\n(5,5): 2, adjacent to (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,4), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7).\n\nThese seem connected, and it's hard to determine exactly where the bombs are.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability and pick a square that seems safer to reveal.\n\nLooking back at row 8, (8,2) seems like a reasonable choice to reveal, as it's adjacent to (8,1) which is 1, and hopefully, it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is definitely safe based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,8): 1, adjacent to (0,9) which is flagged, and (1,8) and (1,9).\n\nSince (0,9) is flagged, which is one bomb, and (0,8) shows 1, there should be no other bombs adjacent to it. So, (1,8) and (1,9) should be safe to reveal.\n\nLet's check (1,8): 1, adjacent to (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,8), (2,9), (3,8), (3,9).\n\n(0,8): 1, (0,9): F, (1,7): _, (1,9): 1, (2,8): _, (2,9): _, (3,8): _, (3,9): _.\n\n(1,8) shows 1, and it's adjacent to (0,9) which is flagged, so there should be no other bombs adjacent to it. Therefore, (1,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,8), (3,9) should be safe.\n\nBut wait, (1,8) is adjacent to (0,8), which is 1, and (0,9), which is flagged. So, the 1 on (1,8) is already satisfied by (0,9). Therefore, the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal (1,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,8), (3,9).\n\nBut let's confirm this.\n\n(1,8): 1, adjacent to (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,8), (2,9), (3,8), (3,9).\n\n(0,8): 1, safe.\n\n(0,9): F, bomb.\n\nSo, the 1 is already satisfied by (0,9). Therefore, the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal (1,7), (1,9), (2,8), (2,9), (3,8), (3,9).\n\nLet's choose to reveal (1,7).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed in this Minesweeper game, we need to make an informed decision about which square to reveal or flag next. Given the current state of the board and the rules of the game, we can deduce safe moves by analyzing the numbers and flags already present.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze Revealed Numbers and Flags:**\n   - Look for squares that have numbers indicating the presence of adjacent bombs.\n   - Check if the number of adjacent flags matches the number on the square.\n   - Identify squares that are definitely safe or definitely bombs based on this information.\n\n2. **Determine Safe Squares:**\n   - If a numbered square has the correct number of adjacent flags, the remaining adjacent unflagged squares are safe to reveal.\n   - If a numbered square has fewer adjacent flags than its number, the remaining adjacent unflagged squares must contain bombs and should be flagged.\n\n3. **Choose a Move:**\n   - Select a safe square to reveal or a square to flag based on the above analysis.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a logical analysis problem rather than a coding problem, the \"solution code\" will be a description of the next move based on the analysis.\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: \n- Looking at square (1,8), which shows '1', and is adjacent to (0,9), which is flagged as a bomb.\n- The '1' indicates exactly one adjacent bomb, which is already flagged at (0,9).\n- Therefore, the other adjacent squares: (1,7), (1,9), (2,8), (2,9), (3,8), and (3,9) are safe to reveal.\n- We will choose to reveal (1,7).\n\nMOVE: 1,7,false\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Square (1,8):** Shows '1', indicating one adjacent bomb.\n- **Adjacent Flags:** Only (0,9) is flagged, which satisfies the '1'.\n- **Safe Squares:** The remaining adjacent squares to (1,8) are safe to reveal.\n- **Chosen Move:** Reveal square (1,7), which is adjacent to (1,8).\n\nThis approach ensures that we are making a safe move based on the current information, minimizing the risk of hitting a bomb.", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n1 2 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n2 .

Since two flags are already placed, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in row 2, column 5: place a flag.\n\nIn row 3, column 3: place a flag.\n\nIn row 4, column 4: place a flag.\n\nBut I only have 8 flags left, and I need to place 3 more flags here. Wait, perhaps not all of these are necessarily bombs.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nThe number 3 in row 3, column 4 requires three adjacent bombs.\n\nAdjacent unknowns are:\n\n- row 2, column 5: .\n\n- row 3, column 3: .\n\n- row 4, column 4: .\n\nIf I place flags in all three, that would satisfy the 3.\n\nBut I need to make sure that these flags don't conflict with other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4: it's a 2, adjacent to:\n\n- row 1, column 3: _\n\n- row 1, column 4: 1\n\n- row 1, column 5: 1\n\n- row 2, column 3: 1\n\n- row 2, column 5: .\n\n- row 3, column 3: .\n\n- row 3, column 4: 3\n\n- row 3, column 5: 1\n\nFor row 2, column 4 (2):\n\n- Adjacent flags: none yet\n\n- Adjacent unknowns: row 2, column 5 (.) and row 3, column 3 (.)\n\nIf I place flags in row 2, column 5 and row 3, column 3, that would satisfy the 2.\n\nSimilarly, for row 3, column 4 (3):\n\n- Adjacent unknowns: row 2, column 5, row 3, column 3, row 4, column 4\n\nIf I place flags in row 2, column 5, row 3, column 3, and row 4, column 4, that would satisfy the 3.\n\nBut I need to check if this is consistent with other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 4: it's a '.', adjacent to:\n\n- row 3, column 3: .\n\n- row 3, column 4: 3\n\n- row 3, column 5: 1\n\n- row 4, column 3: _\n\n- row 4, column 5: _\n\n- row 5, column 3: _\n\n- row 5, column 4: .\n\n- row 5, column 5: .\n\nIf I place a flag in row 4, column 4, I need to see if it conflicts with any numbers.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 3: it's a '_', which is safe.\n\nRow 4, column 5: '_', safe.\n\nRow 5, column 3: '_', safe.\n\nRow 5, column 4: '.', unknown.\n\nRow 5, column 5: '.', unknown.\n\nPlacing a flag in row 4, column 4 should not conflict with these.\n\nSimilarly, row 3, column 5 is a 1, adjacent to:\n\n- row 2, column 4: 2\n\n- row 2, column 5: .\n\n- row 3, column 4: 3\n\n- row 3, column 6: .\n\n- row 4, column 4: .\n\n- row 4, column 5: _\n\n- row 5, column 4: .\n\n- row 5, column 5: .\n\nIf I place a flag in row 2, column 5 and row 3, column 3, that should satisfy the 1 in row 3, column 5.\n\nWait, row 3, column 5 is a 1, and it's adjacent to:\n\n- row 2, column 4: 2\n\n- row 2, column 5: . (potential flag)\n\n- row 3, column 4: 3\n\n- row 3, column 6: .\n\n- row 4, column 4: . (potential flag)\n\n- row 4, column 5: _\n\n- row 5, column 4: .\n\n- row 5, column 5: .\n\nIf I place flags in row 2, column 5 and row 4, column 4, that would make two adjacent flags to row 3, column 5, but it's only a 1.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If row 3, column 5 is a 1, and I place flags in both row 2, column 5 and row 4, column 4, that would make two adjacent flags, which contradicts the 1.\n\nSo, I cannot place flags in both row 2, column 5 and row 4, column 4 if row 3, column 5 is a 1.\n\nTherefore, only one of them can be a flag.\n\nBut earlier, for row 3, column 4 (3), I thought I need to place flags in row 2, column 5, row 3, column 3, and row 4, column 4.\n\nBut that would make two flags adjacent to row 3, column 5, which is a 1, which is invalid.\n\nSo, I need to rethink this.\n\nPerhaps row 3, column 4 (3) needs only two flags instead of three.\n\nWait, but row 3, column 4 is a 3, so it needs three adjacent bombs.\n\nBut if placing flags in row 2, column 5 and row 3, column 3 satisfies two, where is the third?\n\nWait, row 3, column 4 is adjacent to:\n\n- row 2, column 3: 1\n\n- row 2, column 4: 2\n\n- row 2, column 5: .\n\n- row 3, column 3: .\n\n- row 3, column 5: 1\n\n- row 4, column 3: _\n\n- row 4, column 4: .\n\n- row 4, column 5: _\n\nSo, for row 3, column 4 (3):\n\n- Adjacent unknowns: row 2, column 5 (.), row 3, column 3 (.), row 4, column 4 (.)\n\nNeed three bombs in these three unknowns.\n\nBut row 3, column 5 is a 1, which is adjacent to:\n\n- row 2, column 4: 2\n\n- row 2, column 5: .\n\n- row 3, column 4: 3\n\n- row 3, column 6: .\n\n- row 4, column 4: .\n\n- row 4, column 5: _\n\n- row 5, column 4: .\n\n- row 5, column 5: .\n\nIf row 2, column 5 and row 3, column 3 are flags, that would make two adjacent flags to row 3, column 5, but it's only a 1.\n\nSo, that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, only one of row 2, column 5, row 3, column 3, and row 4, column 4 can be a flag to satisfy the 1 in row 3, column 5.\n\nBut row 3, column 4 needs three flags in these three unknowns.\n\nThis seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the adjacent cells.\n\nLet me double-check the adjacency.\n\nFor row 3, column 4 (3):\n\nAdjacent cells are:\n\n- row 2, column 3\n\n- row 2, column 4\n\n- row 2, column 5\n\n- row 3, column 3\n\n- row 3, column 5\n\n- row 4, column 3\n\n- row 4, column 4\n\n- row 4, column 5\n\nNow, row 2, column 3 is a 1, which is not a bomb.\n\nRow 2, column 4 is a 2, not a bomb.\n\nRow 2, column 5 is unknown (.)\n\nRow 3, column 3 is unknown (.)\n\nRow 3, column 5 is a 1, not a bomb.\n\nRow 4, column 3 is '_', safe.\n\nRow 4, column 4 is unknown (.)\n\nRow 4, column 5 is '_', safe.\n\nSo, only row 2, column 5, row 3, column 3, and row 4, column 4 are unknowns, and the 3 needs three bombs in these three unknowns.\n\nBut row 3, column 5 is a 1, which is adjacent to:\n\n- row 2, column 4: 2\n\n- row 2, column 5: .\n\n- row 3, column 4: 3\n\n- row 3, column 6: .\n\n- row 4, column 4: .\n\n- row 4, column 5: _\n\n- row 5, column 4: .\n\n- row 5, column 5: .\n\nSo, row 3, column 5 is a 1, and it's adjacent to row 2, column 5 (.) and row 4, column 4 (.), assuming only one of them is a bomb.\n\nBut row 3, column 4 needs three bombs in row 2, column 5, row 3, column 3, and row 4, column 4.\n\nThis seems impossible because row 3, column 5 requires only one bomb in its unknown adjacent cells.\n\nThere must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nIf row 3, column 4 needs three bombs in its three unknown adjacent cells, then all three must be bombs.\n\nBut row 3, column 5, which is a 1, is adjacent to row 2, column 5 and row 4, column 4, both of which would be bombs if the previous statement is true.\n\nBut that would make two bombs adjacent to row 3, column 5, which is a 1, indicating only one bomb.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for all three unknowns (row 2, column 5; row 3, column 3; row 4, column 4) to be bombs.\n\nHence, my earlier assumption must be wrong.\n\nPerhaps row 3, column 4 does not have three bombs in these three unknowns.\n\nWait, but row 3, column 4 is a 3, and the only unknowns are these three cells.\n\nSo, it must be that all three are bombs.\n\nBut that conflicts with row 3, column 5 being a 1.\n\nTherefore, perhaps there is a mistake in the board configuration or my understanding of adjacency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret this.\n\nWait, perhaps row 3, column 5 is also adjacent to row 3, column 6, which is unknown.\n\nWait, row 3, column 5 is adjacent to:\n\n- row 2, column 4: 2\n\n- row 2, column 5: .\n\n- row 3, column 4: 3\n\n- row 3, column 6: .\n\n- row 4, column 4: .\n\n- row 4, column 5: _\n\n- row 5, column 4: .\n\n- row 5, column 5: .\n\nSo, row 3, column 5 is a 1, and it's adjacent to:\n\n- row 2, column 5: .\n\n- row 3, column 6: .\n\n- row 4, column 4: .\n\nOnly one of these can be a bomb.\n\nBut according to row 3, column 4 (3), row 2, column 5, row 3, column 3, and row 4, column 4 must all be bombs.\n\nBut if row 2, column 5 is a bomb, and row 4, column 4 is a bomb, that would make two bombs adjacent to row 3, column 5, which is a 1.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only way to resolve this is if row 3, column 3 is not a bomb.\n\nThen, row 3, column 4 (3) would need three bombs in row 2, column 5 and row 4, column 4, but that's only two cells, which can't satisfy three bombs.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that row 3, column 4 (3) is adjacent to row 3, column 3 and row 4, column 4, and row 2, column 5.\n\nIf row 3, column 3 is not a bomb, then row 3, column 4 (3) would need bombs in row 2, column 5 and row 4, column 4, and perhaps another cell.\n\nBut row 3, column 4 is only adjacent to these three unknowns.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the adjacency.\n\nWait, row 3, column 4 is adjacent to:\n\n- row 2, column 3: 1\n\n- row 2, column 4: 2\n\n- row 2, column 5: .\n\n- row 3, column 3: .\n\n- row 3, column 5: 1\n\n- row 4, column 3: _\n\n- row 4, column 4: .\n\n- row 4, column 5: _\n\nSo, only row 2, column 5, row 3, column 3, and row 4, column 4 are unknowns.\n\nThus, to satisfy the 3, all three must be bombs.\n\nBut that conflicts with row 3, column 5 being a 1.\n\nTherefore, the only resolution is that row 3, column 4 is miscounted or there's an error in the board.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to conclude that row 3, column 3 is not a bomb.\n\nIf row 3, column 3 is not a bomb, then row 3, column 4 (3) would need bombs in row 2, column 5 and row 4, column 4, which would satisfy the 1 in row 3, column 5.\n\nWait, no. If row 3, column 3 is not a bomb, then row 3, column 4 (3) needs three bombs in the remaining two unknowns, which is impossible.\n\nHence, the only possibility is that row 3, column 3 is a bomb, row 2, column 5 is a bomb, and row 4, column 4 is a bomb.\n\nBut that conflicts with row 3, column 5 being a 1.\n\nTherefore, this board may be unsolvable, or there might be an error in the board configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look for another approach.\n\nLet me try to look at another part of the board.\n\nLooking at the bottom part:\n\nRow 8, column 8: 1, adjacent to:\n\n- row 7, column 7: _\n\n- row 7, column 8: 1\n\n- row 7, column 9: 1\n\n- row 8, column 7: _\n\n- row 8, column 9: 1\n\n- row 9, column 7: _\n\n- row 9, column 8: 1\n\n- row 9, column 9: .\n\nFor row 8, column 8 (1):\n\n- Adjacent bombs: one among the unknowns.\n\nSimilarly, row 8, column 9: 1, adjacent to:\n\n- row 7, column 8: 1\n\n- row 7, column 9: 1\n\n- row 7, column 10: (out of bounds)\n\n- row 8, column 8: 1\n\n- row 8, column 10: (out of bounds)\n\n- row 9, column 8: 1\n\n- row 9, column 9: .\n\n- row 9, column 10: (out of bounds)\n\nSo, for row 8, column 9 (1):\n\n- Adjacent unknowns: row 9, column 9: .\n\nSo, there must be one bomb in row 9, column 9.\n\nTherefore, I should place a flag in row 9, column 9.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nRow 8, column 9 is a 1, and it's adjacent to row 9, column 9, which is unknown.\n\nSo, the one bomb must be in row 9, column 9.\n\nTherefore, I can place a flag there.\n\nAlso, since row 9, column 9 is a bomb, row 9, column 8 is a 1, which is consistent if only row 9, column 9 is a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, row 8, column 8 is a 1, and if row 9, column 9 is a bomb, then the 1 is satisfied.\n\nSo, I can place a flag in row 9, column 9.\n\nNow, with this flag placed, I have 7 flags left to place.\n\nNext, looking at row 9, column 8: it's a 1, adjacent to:\n\n- row 8, column 7: _\n\n- row 8, column 8: 1\n\n- row 8, column 9: 1\n\n- row 9, column 7: _\n\n- row 9, column 9: F\n\n- row 10, column 7: (out of bounds)\n\n- row 10, column 8: (out of bounds)\n\n- row 10, column 9: (out of bounds)\n\nSo, row 9, column 8 (1) has one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- row 8, column 7: _\n\n- row 8, column 8: 1\n\n- row 8, column 9: 1\n\n- row 9, column 7: _\n\n- row 9, column 9: F\n\nRow 9, column 9 is a flag, which counts as one bomb.\n\nThe other adjacent squares are safe: row 8, column 7 (_), row 9, column 7 (_).\n\nSo, I can reveal row 8, column 7 and row 9, column 7.\n\nBut let's see what's in row 8, column 7: it's a '_', which is already safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 9, column 7: '_', safe.\n\nSo, no new information there.\n\nMoving up, looking at row 7, column 9: it's a 1, adjacent to:\n\n- row 6, column 8: _\n\n- row 6, column 9: 1\n\n- row 7, column 8: 1\n\n- row 7, column 10: (out of bounds)\n\n- row 8, column 8: 1\n\n- row 8, column 9: 1\n\n- row 9, column 8: 1\n\n- row 9, column 9: F\n\nSo, row 7, column 9 (1) has one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- row 6, column 8: _\n\n- row 6, column 9: 1\n\n- row 7, column 8: 1\n\n- row 8, column 8: 1\n\n- row 8, column 9: 1\n\n- row 9, column 8: 1\n\n- row 9, column 9: F\n\nOnly row 9, column 9 is a flag, which is one bomb.\n\nThe rest are either numbers or safe spaces.\n\nSo, no new information here.\n\nSimilarly, row 7, column 8: 1, adjacent to:\n\n- row 6, column 7: _\n\n- row 6, column 8: _\n\n- row 6, column 9: 1\n\n- row 7, column 7: _\n\n- row 7, column 9: 1\n\n- row 8, column 7: _\n\n- row 8, column 8: 1\n\n- row 8, column 9: 1\n\nSo, row 7, column 8 (1) has one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- row 6, column 7: _\n\n- row 6, column 8: _\n\n- row 6, column 9: 1\n\n- row 7, column 7: _\n\n- row 7, column 9: 1\n\n- row 8, column 7: _\n\n- row 8, column 8: 1\n\n- row 8, column 9: 1\n\nNo flags adjacent, so the bomb must be in one of the numbered squares, but since numbers aren't bombs, it's likely that the bomb is not in the adjacent squares, which contradicts the 1.\n\nWait, no. Numbers aren't bombs, so the bomb must be in an unflagged, unrevealed square adjacent to it.\n\nBut in this case, all adjacent squares are either '_' (safe) or '1' (not bombs).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet me go back to the top part of the board where I found the contradiction earlier.\n\nI think I need to accept that the board may have an error or that I need to make a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to place a flag where it's certain, like in row 9, column 9, as I did earlier.\n\nBut since I've already decided to place a flag there, and I've run out of clear moves, perhaps I should consider revealing a safe square elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 7: it's a '_', which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 7, column 7: '_', safe.\n\nRow 8, column 7: '_', safe.\n\nRow 9, column 7: '_', safe.\n\nThese are all safe, but won't give new information.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for areas with potential safe moves.\n\nLooking back at the confusion around row 3, column 4, perhaps I need to accept that I have to make a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to place a flag in one of the uncertain squares.\n\nGiven the earlier analysis, placing a flag in row 9, column 9 seems correct.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with that move.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this Minesweeper puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the board and make strategic moves to either reveal safe squares or place flags on squares that are likely to contain bombs. Given the current state of the board, we will follow a step-by-step approach to determine the next best move.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze the Board:**\n   - Identify the positions of revealed numbers and flags.\n   - Determine the relationships between numbers and adjacent squares to infer the locations of bombs.\n\n2. **Check for Obvious Moves:**\n   - Look for squares that can be safely revealed because they are adjacent to numbers whose bomb counts are already satisfied by existing flags.\n   - Identify squares that must contain bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\n3. **Prioritize Safety:**\n   - Prefer moves that are guaranteed to be safe or that have a high probability of being safe based on the current information.\n\n4. **Update the Board State:**\n   - After making a move, update the board state to reflect any new information revealed by the move.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a step-by-step reasoning problem, the \"solution code\" will be a description of the next move to make, based on the analysis.\n\n### Explanation\n\nAfter carefully examining the board, we notice that in the bottom-right corner, there is a square at position (9,9) which is adjacent to several revealed numbers. Specifically, the square at (8,9) is a '1', indicating that there is exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. Given that the only unknown adjacent square is (9,9), it must contain a bomb.\n\nTherefore, the next move is to place a flag on square (9,9).\n\n### Final Move\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: The square at (8,9) is a '1', and its only adjacent unknown square is (9,9).

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 1, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. It's a 10x10 grid with 10 bombs in total, and I have 7 flags left to place. I need to be careful and logical about where I place my flags or reveal tiles to avoid hitting a bomb.\n\nFirst, I should look at the numbers and see what they tell me about the surrounding tiles. Let's start from the top left and work our way across and down.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Column 0: 1\n\n- Column 1: 1\n\n- Column 2: 1\n\n- Column 3: _\n\n- Column 4: _\n\n- Column 5: _\n\n- Column 6: _\n\n- Column 7: _\n\n- Column 8: 1\n\n- Column 9: F (flagged)\n\nSo, in row 0, there are numbers 1,1,1,_,_,_,_,_,1,F.\n\nSimilarly, row 1:\n\n- 2, .,1,_,1,1,1,_,1,1\n\nRow 2:\n\n- .,F,2,1,2,.,1,_,_,_\n\nRow 3:\n\n- 1,1,2,.,3,1,1,_,_,_\n\nRow 4:\n\n- _,_,2,.,2,_,_,_,_,_\n\nRow 5:\n\n- _,_,2,.,2,_,_,_,1,1\n\nRow 6:\n\n- _,_,1,.,1,_,_,_,1,.\n\nRow 7:\n\n- _,_,1,1,1,_,_,_,1,.\n\nRow 8:\n\n- 1,1,_,_,_,_,_,1,1,.\n\nRow 9:\n\n- .,1,_,_,_,_,_,1,.,F\n\nOkay, so I need to look for areas where the numbers and flags give me clear information about what's in the adjacent tiles.\n\nLet's look at row 0, column 0: it's a 1. This means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding tiles. The surrounding tiles are:\n\n- (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nBut (0,1) is a 1, (0,2) is a 1, (0,3) is _, (1,0) is 2, (1,1) is ., (1,2) is 1, (1,3) is _, (1,4) is 1.\n\nNone of these are flagged yet, except for (0,9) which is outside this group. So, for (0,0)=1, I don't have any flags in its adjacent tiles, but it's already satisfied because it's a 1 and there might be one bomb in those adjacent tiles.\n\nWait, but (1,1) is unexplored, and (1,3) is unexplored. Maybe I can find more information elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at row 1, column 1: it's a '.', so unexplored.\n\nRow 1, column 2: it's a 1.\n\nIts adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\nBut let's narrow it down:\n\n- (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=_, (1,1)=., (1,2)=1, (1,3)=_, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,1)=., (2,2)=F, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=1\n\nWait, (2,2) is flagged, so that's one bomb.\n\nSo, for (1,2)=1, it has one bomb in its adjacent tiles. Adjacent tiles are:\n\n- (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2)=F, (2,3)=2\n\nSo, it already has one flag adjacent, which is (2,2). Therefore, there should be no more bombs in its other adjacent tiles.

(2,5)=. is not adjacent to (2,3)=2, so it doesn't help with (2,3)=2.\n\nTherefore, (2,3)=2 needs a bomb in (3,3)=. or (3,4)=., and (2,4)=1 can have its bomb in (1,3)=_, (2,5)=., (3,3)=., (3,4)=., (3,5)=_\n\nBut (1,3)=_ is adjacent to (1,2)=1, which already has its bomb at (2,2)=F, so (1,3)=_ should be safe.\n\nTherefore, for (2,4)=1, the bomb must be in (2,5)=., (3,3)=., (3,4)=., or (3,5)=_\n\nBut (3,3)=. and (3,4)=. are also needed for (2,3)=2.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 8, "y": 8, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. It's a 10x10 grid with 10 bombs in total, and I've got 7 flags left to place. Let's see what I can deduce from the current state.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that cell, and the flags are where I think there are bombs. I need to make sure that the number of flags around each numbered cell matches the number on that cell.\n\nLet's start by looking at the cells that are already revealed and see if there are any obvious moves.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n0 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n\nSo, positions (0,0) to (0,3) are 1,1,1, and then some unexplored spaces, ending with 1 and F at (0,9).\n\nThe '1's here suggest that there is one bomb adjacent to each of these cells. Since (0,9) is flagged, that accounts for the '1' at (0,8), assuming that's the only bomb adjacent to it.\n\nMoving to row 1:\n\n1 2 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n\nHere, (1,0) is 1, (1,1) is 2, (1,2) is unexplored, (1,3) is 1, and so on.\n\nThe '2' at (1,1) means there are two bombs adjacent to it. Adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nFrom row 0, (0,0) is 1, which probably has a bomb adjacent to it, but I need to see.\n\nWait, actually, (0,0) is 1, which means there is one bomb adjacent to it. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nSimilarly, (0,1) is 1, adjacent to (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1).\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for cells where the number of adjacent flags equals the number on the cell, which would mean the remaining adjacent unflagged cells are safe to reveal.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of adjacent unflagged cells equals the number minus the flags, then those must be bombs.\n\nLet me try to find such scenarios.\n\nLooking at row 3:\n\n3 1 1 2 . 3 1 1 _ _ _\n\nSo, (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 1, (3,2) is 2, then (3,4) is 3, and so on.\n\nLet's look at (3,4), which is 3. Its adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nFrom these, (2,3) is 2, (2,4) is ., (2,5) is 2, (3,3) is ., (3,5) is 1, (4,3) is _, (4,4) is _, (4,5) is _.\n\nWait, (2,3) is 2, which means two bombs adjacent to it. Its adjacent cells are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).\n\nFrom these, (1,2) is ., (1,3) is 1, (1,4) is 1, (2,2) is 1, (2,4) is ., (3,2) is 2, (3,3) is ., (3,4) is 3.\n\nHmm, not very helpful yet.\n\nMaybe I should look at row 2:\n\n2 . F 2 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n\nSo, (2,0) is 2, (2,1) is ., (2,2) is F, (2,3) is 2, and so on.\n\nThe '2' at (2,0) has adjacent cells: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\n\nFrom these, (1,0) is 1, (1,1) is 2, (1,2) is ., (2,1) is ., (2,2) is F, (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 1, (3,2) is 2.\n\nSo, the '2' at (2,0) has one flag adjacent (at (2,2)), so it needs one more bomb adjacent.\n\nThe possible candidates are the unflagged adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2).\n\nBut (1,1) is 2, which already has one bomb adjacent (at (2,2)), so it needs one more bomb adjacent.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a cell that's probably safe.\n\nLooking at row 6:\n\n6 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n\nSo, (6,2) is 1, (6,4) is ., (6,5) is 1, and (6,8) is 1.\n\nThe '1' at (6,2) has adjacent cells: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3).\n\nFrom these, (5,1) is _, (5,2) is _, (5,3) is 1, (6,1) is _, (6,3) is ., (7,1) is _, (7,2) is 1, (7,3) is 1.\n\nSo, no flags adjacent to (6,2), but it's supposed to have one bomb adjacent. Therefore, one of its adjacent unflagged cells must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is 1, with adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6).\n\nFrom these, (5,4) is 2, (5,5) is _, (5,6) is _, (6,4) is ., (6,6) is _, (7,4) is _, (7,5) is 1, (7,6) is _.\n\nSo, no flags adjacent to (6,5), meaning one of its adjacent unflagged cells is a bomb.\n\nThis isn't giving me a clear move yet.\n\nLet me look at row 9:\n\n9 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . F\n\nSo, (9,1) is 1, (9,7) is 1, and (9,9) is F.\n\nThe '1' at (9,1) has adjacent cells: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,0), (10,1), (10,2).\n\nBut since the board is 10x10, row 10 doesn't exist, so only (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2).\n\nFrom these, (8,0) is 1, (8,1) is 1, (8,2) is _, (9,0) is _, (9,2) is _.\n\nNo flags adjacent, so one of these unflagged cells must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, the '1' at (9,7) has adjacent cells: (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9,6), (9,8), (10,6), (10,7), (10,8).\n\nAgain, rows above 9 don't exist, so only (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9,6), (9,8).\n\nFrom these, (8,6) is 1, (8,7) is 1, (8,8) is 1, (9,6) is _, (9,8) is 1.\n\nNo flags adjacent, so one of (9,6) or (9,8) is a bomb.\n\nBut (9,8) is 1, which already has one flag at (9,9), so it might be safe.\n\nWait, (9,8) is 1, adjacent to (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9), (10,7), (10,8), (10,9).\n\nBut row 10 doesn't exist, so only (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9).\n\nFrom these, (8,7) is 1, (8,8) is 1, (8,9) is 1, (9,7) is 1, (9,9) is F.\n\nSo, one flag adjacent, which satisfies the '1' at (9,8). Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells are safe.\n\nWait, but (9,8) is 1, and it has one flag adjacent at (9,9), so the other adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal (8,8), which is currently _, because it's adjacent to (9,8) and the '1' is already satisfied.\n\nSo, my move would be to reveal (8,8).\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\n(9,8) is 1, adjacent cells are (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9).\n\n(9,9) is F, which counts as one bomb.\n\nSo, the remaining adjacent cells are (8,7), (8,8), (9,7).\n\n(8,7) is 1, (8,8) is _, (9,7) is 1.\n\nSince (9,8) has its required bomb adjacent (at (9,9)), the other adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nTherefore, revealing (8,8) should be safe.\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (9,8) is marked with '1', and it has one adjacent flag at (9,9). Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells are safe to reveal. Hence, I will reveal (8,8).\n\nMOVE: 8,8,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F\n1 2 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n2 .
