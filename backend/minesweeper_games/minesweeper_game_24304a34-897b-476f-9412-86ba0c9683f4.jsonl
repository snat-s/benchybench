So, the bomb must be in one of the unexplored adjacent squares in ROW 1.\n\n**ROW 1:**\n- (1,1) shows '1', adjacent squares:\n  - (0,0)\n  - (0,1)\n  - (0,2)\n  - (1,0)\n  - (1,2)\n  \nSince (1,1) is already '1' and there are no flags, we need to be careful when placing flags here.\n\n**ROW 2:**\n- (2,2) is a bomb (`*`), so it's already identified.\n\n**ROW 3:**\n- (3,3) shows '1', adjacent squares:\n  - (2,2) \u2013 already a bomb\n  - (2,3)\n  - (2,4)\n  - (3,2)\n  - (3,4)\n  \nSince (2,2) is a bomb, there can't be another bomb adjacent to (3,3).\n\n**ROW 5:**\n- (5,0) shows '1', adjacent squares:\n  - (4,0)\n  - (4,1)\n  - (5,1)\n  \n(5,1) is already '1', so we need to ensure that placing a flag here doesn't conflict.\n\n### Step 3: Looking for Safe Moves\n\nI need to find a square that is guaranteed to be safe based on the numbers and existing information.\n\n**Analyzing (6,1):**\n- (6,1) is unexplored.\n- Adjacent numbers:\n  - (5,0) shows '1'\n  - (5,1) shows '1'\n  - (6,2) is unexplored\n\nGiven that (5,0) shows '1' and (5,1) shows '1', and there are no adjacent flags, it's possible that (6,1) is safe.\n\n### Step 4: Making the Move\n\nBased on the analysis, revealing (6,1) seems like a safe bet as there's no immediate indication that it's a bomb.\n\n**Move:**\n```\nMOVE: 6,1,false\n```\nThis means I'm choosing to reveal the tile at row 6, column 1, without placing a flag.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Move\n\nAfter revealing (6,1), I'll update the board and check if it provides new information or conflicts.\n\nIf (6,1) turns out to be a bomb, the game would end, but based on the numbers, it's more likely safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy systematically analyzing each numbered tile and considering the adjacent squares, I've deduced that revealing (6,1) is a safe move at this stage of the game.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nEXPLANATION: Based on the adjacent numbers and absence of flags, revealing (6,1) is a safe move.\nMOVE: 6,1,false\n```", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n1 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . . . .\n2 _ 1 . 1 _ 2 . . . .\n3 _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . . . .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n5 1 1 _ 1 1 1 . . . .\n6 . 1 _ 1 . . . . . .\n7 . 1 1 2 . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

It has no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n   - Look at the number '1' at (1,1). It has no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n   - Look at the number '2' at (2,5).

Since (0,5) needs exactly one bomb, and there are no adjacent flags, (0,6) could be a bomb or safe. We need more information.\n   - The tile at (1,0) is unexplored and adjacent to the '1' at (1,1). Since (1,1) needs exactly one bomb, and there are no adjacent flags, (1,0) could be a bomb or safe. We need more information.\n   - The tile at (2,6) is unexplored and adjacent to the '2' at (2,5).
