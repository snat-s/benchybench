From the counts around the revealed tiles, there is still potential to place flags.\n2. Since we see a confined area of 1s providing information about the adjacent bombs, we must make our next move judiciously.\n\nGiven that (1,1) has potential conflicts as it indicates one adjacent bomb, and it can only base on the already revealed 1s, we explore either (0,2) to the right of (0,1) or went below (2,0) leading further down into unresolved areas.\n\nSince there could logically be bombs near (0,2) and to explore if there are any intersections with (1,1), we can proceed to reveal letter squares, so let's reveal (2,0).\n\n**Next Move Explanation:**\nWe will reveal (2,0) to gain information about bombs below the first row.\n\nMOVE: 2,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 . . . . . . . . .\n1 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

It is adjacent to unexplored tiles at (1,0) and (0,1). Since there is no adjacent flagged tile, there must be 1 bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles.\n   - At positions (1,0) and (1,1), they both show '1's. Position (1,1) can only count the unexplored tile (0,2) since (0,0) is adjacent to it. Thus, there may already be 1 bomb associated with (1,1) from unexplored tiles at (0,2).\n   - The tiles in row 2 (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) show numbers indicating potential bombs in adjacent tiles.\n\n### Moving through potential conflicts:\n- Checking the numbers for conflicts, we have many adjacent unexplored tiles that could house bombs.\n- Particularly for 1's, we need to verify they do not conflict with other counts where the numbers indicate a higher adjacent count (e.g., 2's must have 2 bombs adjacent). \n\n### Next Move Decision:\n1. The lower rows (especially row 3 to 6) have multiple adjacent 1's that seem to have unexplored spaces lining up and help indicate potential bomb placements. \n2. Given that there are 10 flags and likely many configurations possible, let's consider exploring an unexplored space adjacent to a bomb count that has flexibility.\n\nI choose to reveal (2,0) next, as it could yield valid information for evaluating the surrounding numbers:\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing the space at (2,0) may provide clarity on the adjacent tiles and help to confirm or deny the presence of bombs adjacent to the revealed '1' tiles.\nMOVE: 2,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 . . . . . . . . .\n1 1 1 2 . . . . . . .\n2 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n4 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n5 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n6 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n7 1 2 1 . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
