No adjacent flags.\n   - **Analysis:** Since there are no adjacent flags, there must be exactly one bomb in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n2. **Position (2,5):** Number `2`\n   - Adjacent squares: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n   - There's a flag at (3,6).\n   - **Analysis:** Only one adjacent flag, so there must be one more bomb in the remaining adjacent squares.\n\n3. **Position (3,5):** Number `2`\n   - Adjacent squares: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n   - There's a flag at (3,6).\n   - **Analysis:** Similar to (2,5), only one adjacent flag, so one more bomb must be adjacent.\n\n4. **Position (4,6):** Flag `F`\n   - **Analysis:** This flag is adjacent to multiple numbers. Need to ensure it's correctly placed.\n\n5. **Position (4,0) to (4,2):** Each has number `1`\n   - Adjacent squares: Various unexplored squares.\n   - **Analysis:** Each `1` requires exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\n6. **Position (5,2) to (5,5):** Numbers `1`, `1`, `2`, `2`\n   - **Analysis:** Each number requires the corresponding number of adjacent bombs.\n\n7. **Position (6,6):** Number `1`\n   - **Analysis:** Exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\n8. **Position (7,6):** Number `2`\n   - **Analysis:** Two adjacent bombs.\n\n9. **Position (8,6) to (8,9):** Each has number `1`\n   - **Analysis:** Each `1` requires exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Potential Conflicts**\n\nI looked for any inconsistencies where the number of adjacent flags exceeds the number indicated.\n\n- **Position (3,5):** Number `2` with one adjacent flag at (3,6).\n  - **Analysis:** Correct, as one flag means one more bomb is needed.\n\n- **Position (4,6):** Flag `F`.\n  - **Analysis:** This flag is adjacent to multiple numbers. Need to ensure it doesn't cause conflicts.\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Remaining Flags vs Bombs**\n\n- **Total Bombs:** 10\n- **Flags Placed:** 2 (at (3,6) and (4,6))\n- **Flags Remaining:** 8\n\n**Analysis:** There are 8 flags left to place for the remaining 8 bombs.\n\n### **Step 4: Deciding the Next Move**\n\nBased on the analysis, I need to decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile.\n\n**Potential Moves:**\n\n1. **Revealing Unexplored Squares:**\n   - To avoid guessing, I should look for squares that can be safely revealed based on existing numbers and flags.\n\n2. **Placing Flags:**\n   - Only place a flag if it's certain to be a bomb and doesn't conflict with adjacent numbers.\n\n**Focusing on Position (1,5):** Number `1`\n\n- Adjacent squares: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n  \n**Analyzing Adjacent Squares:**\n\n- **Position (2,5):** Number `2` with one adjacent flag.\n  - Needs one more bomb adjacent.\n  \n- **Position (1,6):** Unexplored.\n  \n- **Position (2,6):** Unexplored.\n\nSince (1,5) is a `1` with no adjacent flags, there must be exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. Given that (2,5) is a `2` with one adjacent flag, it needs one more bomb. If we assume that the bomb for (1,5) is at (2,6), then:\n\n- **Position (2,6):** Likely a bomb.\n\nBut before placing a flag, I need to verify if this assumption holds without conflicting with other numbers.\n\n**Checking Position (2,6):**\n\nIf (2,6) is a bomb:\n\n- **Impact on Position (2,5):** Number `2` already has one flag at (3,6). Placing a flag at (2,6) would satisfy the `2`.\n\n- **Impact on Position (1,5):** Number `1` would have one adjacent bomb at (2,6), satisfying its condition.\n\n**Decision:** It's safe to place a flag at (2,6).\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nAfter careful analysis, I concluded that placing a flag at position (2,6) is the most logical and safe next move. This placement aligns with the numbers revealed and doesn't introduce any conflicts.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Position (2,6) is deduced to be a bomb based on the numbers at (1,5) and (2,5), ensuring consistency with adjacent revealed numbers.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,6,true", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 2 . 2 _ _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 2 F 2 _ _\n4 1 1 1 _ _ F 1 1 _ _\n5 . . 1 1 2 2 1 _ _ _\n6 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n7 . . . . . . 2 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 1 1 1 1\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

The unexplored adjacent tiles are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), and (1,7). However, (1,7) is already a '1', so it cannot be a bomb.

Since (3,7) is adjacent to the '1' at (4,6), which already has a flag, (3,7) cannot be a bomb. Therefore, the bomb must be at (2,5), (2,7), or (3,5).\n\n3. **Safe Reveal**:\n   - The '1' at (4,6) already has a flag at (4,5), so the adjacent unexplored tiles (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), and (5,7) are safe to reveal.\n   - The '1' at (5,7) has no adjacent flags, so we need to look for the bomb among its adjacent unexplored tiles. The unexplored adjacent tiles are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), and (6,8). Since (4,6) is already a '1' and (5,6) is a '1', the bomb must be at (4,7), (4,8), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), or (6,8).\n\n### MOVE:\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (3,5) is safe because it is adjacent to the '2' at (3,6), which already has one flag, so there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to it.

Let's check for any conflicts:\n\n1. **Position (1,5):** Shows '1'. Adjacent to this are:\n   - (0,4), (0,5), (0,6) \u2014 all unexplored.\n   - (1,4), (1,6) \u2014 (1,6) is revealed as '1'.\n   - (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) \u2014 (2,5) is '2', (2,6) is flagged ('F').\n\n   Since (2,6) is flagged, it's considered a bomb. Therefore, (1,5) already has one adjacent bomb, and no additional bombs should be adjacent to it.\n\n2. **Position (2,5):** Shows '2'. Adjacent squares include:\n   - (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) \u2014 (1,5) is '1', (1,6) is '1'.\n   - (2,4), (2,6) \u2014 (2,6) is flagged ('F').\n   - (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) \u2014 (3,5) is '2'.\n\n   Since (2,6) is flagged, there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to (2,5). Looking at the unexplored adjacent squares: (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (3,4), (3,6).\n\n3. **Position (2,7):** Shows '2'. Adjacent squares include:\n   - (1,6), (1,7), (1,8) \u2014 (1,6) and (1,7) are '1's.\n   - (2,6), (2,8) \u2014 (2,6) is flagged ('F').\n   - (3,6), (3,7), (3,8) \u2014 (3,6) is unexplored, (3,7) is '2'.\n\n   Since (2,6) is flagged, there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to (2,7). Unexplored adjacent squares: (1,8), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8).\n\n### **Analyzing Safe Moves**\n\nGiven the above observations, I need to determine the safest move to progress without revealing a bomb.\n\n1. **Position (3,6):** Adjacent to (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7).\n   - (2,6) is flagged ('F').\n   - (3,5) and (3,7) both show '2'.\n   - (4,5) is flagged ('F').\n\n   Considering (3,5) shows '2', and it's adjacent to (3,6), which is unexplored, and (4,5) is flagged, there might be a bomb at (3,6). But I need to verify this further.\n\n2. **Position (1,6):** Shows '1'. Adjacent to (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7).\n   - (1,5) is '1', (1,7) is '1'.\n   - (2,5) is '2', (2,6) is flagged ('F'), (2,7) is '2'.\n\n   Since (2,6) is flagged, (1,6) already has one adjacent bomb, and the '1' indicates that there should be exactly one bomb adjacent. Therefore, the other adjacent unexplored squares \u2014 (0,5), (0,6), (0,7) \u2014 should be safe to reveal.\n\n### **Deciding on the Next Move**\n\nBased on the analysis, revealing position (0,6) seems safe because:\n\n- It's adjacent to (1,6), which shows '1' and already has a flagged bomb at (2,6).\n- There should be no additional bombs adjacent to (1,6).\n  \nTherefore, revealing (0,6) is a low-risk move that can provide more information about the board.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Position (0,6) is adjacent to (1,6), which shows '1' and already has a flagged bomb at (2,6).

Here's what I observe:\n\n- **Board Size:** 10x10\n- **Total Bombs:** 10\n- **Flags Remaining:** 7\n- **Revealed Tiles:** Some numbers (1, 2) and flags (F) are present.\n- **Unexplored Tiles:** Denoted by dots (.), indicating they haven't been clicked yet.\n\n### **Analyzing Revealed Numbers and Flags**\n\n1. **Row 1:**\n   - Tiles (1,4) is flagged (F).\n   - Adjacent tiles (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) are all marked as '1'.\n\n2. **Row 2:**\n   - Tile (2,6) is flagged (F).\n   - Adjacent tiles (2,5) is '2', (2,7) is '2'.\n\n3. **Row 3:**\n   - Tile (3,6) is a dot (.), unexplored.\n   - Adjacent tiles (3,5) is '2', (3,7) is '2'.\n\n4. **Row 4:**\n   - Tile (4,6) is flagged (F).\n   - Adjacent tiles (4,5) is 'F', (4,7) is '1'.\n\n5. **Row 5:**\n   - Tiles (5,0) to (5,2) are dots (.), except (5,2) which is '1'.\n   - Tile (5,6) is '1'.\n\n6. **Row 6:**\n   - All tiles are dots (.), except (6,6) which is '1'.\n\n7. **Row 7:**\n   - All tiles are dots (.), except (7,6) which is '2'.\n\n8. **Row 8:**\n   - Tiles (8,0) to (8,5) are dots (.).\n   - Tiles (8,6) to (8,9) are '1'.\n\n9. **Row 9:**\n   - All tiles are dots (.).\n\n### **Identifying Safe Moves**\n\nOne of the core strategies in Minesweeper is to identify tiles that are guaranteed to be safe to click. This can be determined by analyzing the numbers and their adjacent flagged tiles.\n\n1. **Tile (3,6):** \n   - Adjacent to '2' at (3,5) and '2' at (3,7).\n   - Since there's already a flag at (2,6), which is adjacent to both '2's, and both '2's indicate exactly two bombs around them, it's safe to assume that (3,6) is safe.\n\n2. **Tile (5,0) to (5,1):**\n   - Adjacent to '1' at (5,2).\n   - There's no flag adjacent to (5,2), so it's uncertain whether these tiles are safe.\n\n3. **Tile (6,0) to (6,5):**\n   - Adjacent to '1' at (6,6).\n   - Since (6,6) is '1' and there are multiple unexplored tiles around it, it's risky to click these without more information.\n\n4. **Tile (7,0) to (7,5):**\n   - Adjacent to '2' at (7,6).\n   - Similar to (6,6), it's uncertain without more flags.\n\n5. **Tile (8,0) to (8,5):**\n   - Adjacent to '1' at (8,6).\n   - Again, without knowing the exact location of bombs, clicking these is risky.\n\n6. **Tile (9,0) to (9,9):**\n   - All are unexplored, and there's no adjacent number to guide the decision.\n\n### **Deciding the Next Move**\n\nBased on the above analysis, the safest move is to reveal tile (3,6). Here's why:\n\n- **Adjacent Numbers:** It's adjacent to two '2's at (3,5) and (3,7).\n- **Existing Flag:** There's already a flag at (2,6), which is adjacent to both '2's.\n- **Conclusion:** Since each '2' requires exactly two bombs around them, and one bomb is already flagged at (2,6), the other bomb must be at (3,6). However, if (3,6) were a bomb, it would have been flagged. Since it's not, it's safe to reveal.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (3,6) is adjacent to two '2's with one bomb already flagged. Therefore, it's safe to reveal this tile.\n\n**MOVE:** 3,6,false\n\nBy revealing (3,6), I can gather more information about the surrounding tiles, which will help in making informed decisions in subsequent moves.", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ F 1 1 1 _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 2 F 2 _ _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 2 . 2 _ _\n4 1 1 1 _ _ F 1 1 _ _\n5 . . 1 1 2 2 1 _ _ _\n6 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n7 . . . . . . 2 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 1 1 1 1\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
