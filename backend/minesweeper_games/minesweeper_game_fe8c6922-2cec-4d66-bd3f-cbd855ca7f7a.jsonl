{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state. The board is completely empty, with all squares marked as '.' which means they're unexplored. The game info says there are 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs. So, I need to place 10 flags to mark all the bombs without revealing any.\n\nSince the board is completely unexplored, I don't have any numbers to guide me. That means I can't rely on any of the critical flag placement rules because there are no revealed numbers yet. Without any information, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nOne strategy in Minesweeper when you have no revealed squares is to click on the edges or corners because statistically, there's a slightly lower chance of hitting a bomb there. But since the board is 10x10 with 10 bombs, the density is 10%, which is the same throughout. So, maybe it doesn't matter where I click.\n\nAlternatively, I could start by flagging some squares, but without any revealed numbers, I can't be certain. So, maybe the best approach is to reveal a square and see if it gives me any clues.\n\nLooking at the board, I'll choose the top-left corner, position (0,0). It's a common starting point and might help me get some numbers to work with. If I reveal (0,0) and it's a bomb, the game ends, but I think the chances are low since it's a 10x10 board with 10 bombs, so each square has a 10% chance. But I have to take that risk to start the game.\n\nSo, I'll decide to reveal (0,0). Hopefully, it's a safe square, and it will show me a number, which I can then use to deduce where the bombs are around it.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Starting by revealing (0,0) to get initial information.\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 2, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the information provided.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left, with 10 flags remaining. That means I need to flag all 10 bombs correctly to win. The board has some revealed numbers and some empty spaces, but most of it is still unexplored.\n\nLooking at the board, the top two rows have some numbers. Specifically, at position (0,1), there's a 1, and at (1,0) and (1,1), there are 1 and 2 respectively. The rest of the board is mostly dots, which means unexplored spaces.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board. Row 0 has a 1 at column 1, and row 1 has 1 at column 0 and 2 at column 1. The rest of row 1 from column 2 to 9 is unexplored, as are all the other rows except for row 0 and 1.\n\nThe rules state that each number indicates exactly the number of adjacent bombs. So, for each number, I need to look at its neighboring cells and see if any of them could be bombs or if they can be ruled out.\n\nStarting with the 1 at (0,1). This means that exactly one of its adjacent cells is a bomb. The adjacent cells for (0,1) are:\n\n- (0,0): This is empty, so it's not a bomb.\n- (0,2): Unexplored.\n- (1,0): Revealed as 1, so it's not a bomb.\n- (1,1): Revealed as 2, so not a bomb.\n- (1,2): Unexplored.\n- (0,0) is already empty, so we can ignore it.\n\nWait, actually, the adjacent cells for (0,1) would be:\n\n- (0,0) to the left\n- (0,2) to the right\n- (1,0) below-left\n- (1,1) below\n- (1,2) below-right\n\nSo, from these, (0,0) is empty, (1,0) is 1, which is a number, so it's not a bomb. (1,1) is 2, which is also a number, not a bomb. So the possible bomb locations adjacent to (0,1) are (0,2) and (1,2).\n\nSince the number is 1, only one of these two can be a bomb. So either (0,2) is a bomb or (1,2) is a bomb, but not both.\n\nNow, looking at the 1 at (1,0). This is another 1, so it must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells for (1,0) are:\n\n- (0,0): Empty\n- (0,1): 1, not a bomb\n- (1,1): 2, not a bomb\n- (2,0): Unexplored\n- (2,1): Unexplored\n\nSo the possible bombs for (1,0) are (2,0) and (2,1). Again, only one of these can be a bomb.\n\nNext, the 2 at (1,1). This means two bombs are adjacent. The adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,0): Empty\n- (0,1): 1\n- (0,2): Unexplored\n- (1,0): 1\n- (1,2): Unexplored\n- (2,0): Unexplored\n- (2,1): Unexplored\n- (2,2): Unexplored\n\nBut wait, since (1,1) is 2, and it's adjacent to (1,0) which is 1, which we've already considered. So the bombs adjacent to (1,1) must be in the unexplored cells around it.\n\nBut let's see: (1,1) is 2, so two bombs must be in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,0): Empty\n- (0,1): 1\n- (0,2): ?\n- (1,0): 1\n- (1,2): ?\n- (2,0): ?\n- (2,1): ?\n- (2,2): ?\n\nSo, excluding the already revealed numbers, the possible bomb locations are (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2). But since (1,1) is 2, two of these must be bombs.\n\nBut wait, the 1 at (0,1) can only have one bomb in (0,2) or (1,2). The 1 at (1,0) can only have one bomb in (2,0) or (2,1). So if I consider these, maybe I can find overlapping possibilities.\n\nIf (0,2) is a bomb, then (1,2) cannot be a bomb because of the 1 at (0,1). Similarly, if (1,2) is a bomb, (0,2) cannot be. For (1,0), if (2,0) is a bomb, then (2,1) cannot be, and vice versa.\n\nBut since (1,1) is 2, it needs two bombs in its adjacent cells. Let's see how these could overlap.\n\nIf (0,2) is a bomb, that would satisfy the 1 at (0,1). Then, for (1,1) to have two bombs, another bomb would need to be in (1,2), but that's not possible because (0,1) can only have one bomb. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, if (1,2) is a bomb, that would satisfy the 1 at (0,1). Then, for (1,1), another bomb is needed. That could be either (2,0) or (2,1). But (1,0) is 1, so if (2,0) is a bomb, that would satisfy (1,0). Alternatively, if (2,1) is a bomb, that would satisfy (1,0) as well.\n\nWait, but (1,0) is 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. So if (2,0) is a bomb, that would satisfy (1,0). Then, for (1,1), another bomb would need to be in (1,2) or (2,1) or (2,2). But (1,2) is already considered as a possible bomb for (0,1).\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for cells that are definitely bombs or definitely safe.\n\nLooking at (0,1) which is 1, and its adjacent cells. If (0,2) is a bomb, then (1,2) can't be. But if (1,2) is a bomb, then (0,2) can't be. But since (1,1) is 2, which requires two bombs, maybe both (0,2) and (1,2) can't be bombs because that would give (0,1) two bombs, which contradicts the 1. So perhaps one of them is a bomb, but not both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (2,0) and (2,1) are bombs. Let's see: If (2,0) is a bomb, that would satisfy (1,0)'s 1. Then, (2,1) could be a bomb, which would contribute to (1,1)'s 2. Additionally, (2,2) could be another bomb, but that's three bombs, which might be too many because the total bombs are 10, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, but let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, the 1 at (0,1) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (0,0) is empty, (1,0) is 1, (1,1) is 2. So the possible bombs are (0,2) and (1,2). So either (0,2) is a bomb, or (1,2) is a bomb, but not both.\n\nSimilarly, the 1 at (1,0) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (0,0) is empty, (0,1) is 1, (1,1) is 2. So the possible bombs are (2,0) and (2,1). So either (2,0) is a bomb, or (2,1) is a bomb, but not both.\n\nNow, the 2 at (1,1) needs two bombs in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). From these, (0,0) is empty, (0,1) is 1, (1,0) is 1, (1,1) is 2. So the possible bombs are (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).\n\nBut from the 1s, we know that only one of (0,2) or (1,2) can be a bomb, and only one of (2,0) or (2,1) can be a bomb.\n\nSo, for (1,1) to have two bombs, it must have two of these four cells: (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1). But considering the 1s, only one of (0,2) or (1,2) can be a bomb, and only one of (2,0) or (2,1) can be a bomb. So the maximum bombs adjacent to (1,1) would be two, which is exactly what it needs. So that means, the two bombs adjacent to (1,1) must be one from the pair (0,2,1,2) and one from the pair (2,0,2,1).\n\nSo, for example, if (0,2) is a bomb, then (2,0) or (2,1) must be a bomb. Or, if (1,2) is a bomb, then (2,0) or (2,1) must be a bomb.\n\nBut let's see if we can find a contradiction or a definite placement.\n\nIf I assume that (0,2) is a bomb, then (1,2) cannot be a bomb. Then, for (1,1) to have two bombs, one would be (0,2) and the other would have to be either (2,0) or (2,1). But (2,0) or (2,1) can only be one bomb because of the 1 at (1,0). So if (0,2) is a bomb, then (2,0) or (2,1) must be a bomb, which would give (1,1) two bombs. But then, that would mean that (1,0) has (2,0) or (2,1) as a bomb, which would satisfy its 1.\n\nAlternatively, if (1,2) is a bomb, then (0,2) is not a bomb. Then, (1,1) would need another bomb, which would have to be either (2,0) or (2,1). But again, only one of those can be a bomb because of the 1 at (1,0).\n\nWait, but (1,1) needs two bombs, so if (1,2) is a bomb, then (2,0) or (2,1) must be another bomb. But that would require two bombs, which is possible because (1,0) can only have one, so perhaps (2,0) is a bomb, and (2,1) is not, but then (1,1) would have (1,2) and (2,0) as bombs, which would satisfy its 2.\n\nAlternatively, (2,1) could be a bomb, and (1,2) could be a bomb, but that would mean two bombs adjacent to (1,0), which is 1, which would be a problem because (1,0) can only have one bomb.\n\nWait, no. The 1 at (1,0) has adjacent cells (2,0) and (2,1). So if both (2,0) and (2,1) were bombs, that would make (1,0) have two bombs, which contradicts its 1. So only one of them can be a bomb.\n\nSo, if (1,2) is a bomb, then (1,1) needs another bomb, which must be either (2,0) or (2,1). But if (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,0) is satisfied. If (2,1) is a bomb, then (1,0) is also satisfied.\n\nBut wait, if (1,2) is a bomb, that's one bomb for (1,1). Then, another bomb must be in (2,0) or (2,1). But if (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,0) is satisfied. If (2,1) is a bomb, then (1,0) is satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, if (0,2) is a bomb, that's one for (0,1), and then (2,0) or (2,1) is another bomb for (1,1). But then, (1,0) would be satisfied by (2,0) or (2,1).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look for cells that must be safe.\n\nLooking at (2,0), if it's a bomb, that would satisfy (1,0)'s 1. But if (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s 2 would need another bomb. That could be (0,2) or (1,2). But if (0,2) is a bomb, that would satisfy (0,1)'s 1, and (2,0) would satisfy (1,0)'s 1, and (1,1)'s 2 would be (0,2) and (2,0). But then, that would mean two bombs adjacent to (1,1), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if (2,1) is a bomb, then (1,0)'s 1 is satisfied, and (1,1)'s 2 would need another bomb, which could be (1,2) or (0,2).\n\nWait, but if (2,1) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s adjacent cells would include (2,1) and possibly (0,2) or (1,2). But (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1), which is 1, so if (0,2) is a bomb, that's one, and (2,1) is another, but that would make (1,1)'s count as 2, which is correct. But then, (1,0) would have (2,1) as a bomb, which is one, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,0) is satisfied, and (1,1) would need another bomb, which could be (0,2) or (1,2).\n\nWait, but if (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s adjacent bombs would be (2,0) and either (0,2) or (1,2). But (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1), which is 1, so if (0,2) is a bomb, that's one for (0,1), and (2,0) is another, but that would mean (1,1) has two bombs, which is correct. But then, (1,0) is satisfied by (2,0).\n\nAlternatively, if (2,1) is a bomb, then (1,0) is satisfied, and (1,1) needs another bomb, which could be (1,2) or (0,2).\n\nWait, but if (1,2) is a bomb, that would satisfy (0,1)'s 1, and (2,1) would be another bomb for (1,1). So that's possible.\n\nSo, in this scenario, (1,2) and (2,1) are bombs. That would mean (0,1)'s 1 is satisfied by (1,2), and (1,0)'s 1 is satisfied by (2,1). Then, (1,1)'s 2 is satisfied by (1,2) and (2,1). That seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, if (0,2) is a bomb, then (1,2) can't be. Then, (1,1)'s 2 would need another bomb, which could be (2,0) or (2,1). But if (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,0)'s 1 is satisfied. If (2,1) is a bomb, then (1,0)'s 1 is satisfied.\n\nBut if (0,2) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s 2 would be (0,2) and either (2,0) or (2,1). But that would require that (2,0) or (2,1) is a bomb, which would satisfy (1,0)'s 1.\n\nSo, in either case, (2,0) or (2,1) is a bomb.\n\nWait, but if (0,2) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s 2 would need another bomb in (2,0) or (2,1). So that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, if (1,2) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s 2 would need another bomb in (2,0) or (2,1).\n\nWait, but (1,2) is adjacent to (1,1), which is 2. So if (1,2) is a bomb, that's one, and (2,0) or (2,1) would be the second.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for cells that must be safe.\n\nLooking at (2,0): if (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,0)'s 1 is satisfied, and (1,1)'s 2 would need another bomb, which could be (0,2) or (1,2). But if (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s 2 would need another bomb, which could be (0,2) or (1,2). But if (0,2) is a bomb, that's one for (0,1), and (2,0) is another for (1,1). Alternatively, if (1,2) is a bomb, that's one for (0,1), and (2,0) is another for (1,1).\n\nWait, but if (2,0) is a bomb, then (1,0) is satisfied. Then, (1,1) needs another bomb, which could be (0,2) or (1,2). But if (0,2) is a bomb, that's one for (0,1), and (2,0) is another for (1,1). That would mean (0,2) and (2,0) are bombs. But (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1), which is 1, so that's okay. But then, (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0), which is 1, so that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, if (1,2) is a bomb, that's one for (0,1), and (2,0) is another for (1,1). That would also work.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should look for cells that are definitely safe.\n\nLooking at (0,2): if (0,2) is a bomb, then (0,1)'s 1 is satisfied, and (1,1)'s 2 would need another bomb, which could be (2,0) or (2,1). But if (0,2) is a bomb, then (1,2) cannot be a bomb because of (0,1)'s 1. So (1,2) must be safe.\n\nWait, that's a good point. If (0,2) is a bomb, then (1,2) cannot be a bomb because (0,1) is 1. So (1,2) would be safe. Similarly, if (1,2) is a bomb, then (0,2) cannot be a bomb, so (0,2) would be safe.\n\nSo, perhaps I can deduce that one of (0,2) or (1,2) is a bomb, and the other is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,0)'s 1, either (2,0) or (2,1) is a bomb, but not both.\n\nSo, considering that, perhaps I can look for cells that must be safe.\n\nLooking at (2,2): it's unexplored. Is there any way to determine if it's safe? Let's see. (1,1) is 2, and it's adjacent to (2,2). So if (2,2) were a bomb, that would be another bomb adjacent to (1,1), but (1,1) already has two bombs in (0,2) and (2,0), for example. Wait, no, because (1,1)'s adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So if (2,2) is a bomb, that would add another bomb to (1,1)'s count, making it 3, which contradicts the 2. So (2,2) cannot be a bomb. Therefore, (2,2) must be safe. So I can reveal (2,2) safely.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Because (1,1) is 2, and if (2,2) were a bomb, that would add another bomb, making it 3, which is more than the 2. So (2,2) must be safe.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal (2,2). Let me check that again.\n\nIf (2,2) were a bomb, then (1,1) would have three bombs: (0,2), (1,2), and (2,2). But (1,1) is 2, so that's impossible. Therefore, (2,2) must be safe.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal (2,2). That's a good move because it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could also look at other cells. For example, (2,1): if (2,1) is a bomb, then (1,1)'s 2 would be satisfied by (2,1) and, say, (0,2) or (1,2). But I'm not sure yet.\n\nBut since I can confirm that (2,2) is safe, I can reveal that cell. That would help me gain more information.\n\nSo, my next move would be to reveal (2,2), which is safe.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (2,2) is safe because if it were a bomb, it would cause the number at (1,1) to be 3 instead of 2.\nMOVE: 2,2,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
