{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board. It's a 10x10 grid, and all the squares are unexplored, represented by dots. There are 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining, so I need to flag all the bombs correctly.\n\nSince the board is completely unexplored, I don't have any numbers or revealed squares to work with. That means I can't use any of the critical flag placement rules yet because there are no numbers indicating adjacent bombs. Without any revealed numbers, I can't determine which squares are safe or which might contain bombs based on adjacent flags.\n\nIn this situation, my best option is to start by revealing a square. Typically, the center of the board is a good starting point because it maximizes the information I can get from the first move. However, since the board is 10x10, the exact center would be around (4,4) or (5,5). Let me choose (4,4) as my starting point.\n\nBy revealing (4,4), I can get some initial information. If it's a number, I'll know how many bombs are adjacent, and I can start flagging based on that. If it's a bomb, the game ends, but that's a risk I have to take to start the game.\n\nAlternatively, I could choose a corner, but revealing a corner might not give as much information as the center. The center is more likely to be surrounded by other squares that can be revealed next, helping me build a map of the board.\n\nSo, my plan is to reveal the square at (4,4). This move will either give me a number, allowing me to proceed with flagging, or it might be a bomb, ending the game. Since I have to start somewhere, this seems like the most logical first move.\n\nI don't have any flags to place yet because there's no information about where the bombs might be. Placing a flag without any clues would be a guess, which isn't the best strategy. Revealing a square gives me concrete information to work with.\n\nIn summary, I'll reveal the square at (4,4) to start gathering information about the board's layout.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Since the board is completely unexplored, I'll start by revealing a central square to gather information about potential bombs. This move will help me determine the next steps based on the number revealed.\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
