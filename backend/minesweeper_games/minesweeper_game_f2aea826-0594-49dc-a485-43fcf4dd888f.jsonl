The best first move is typically a middle or corner square, as it provides the most information without high risk.\n\nI'll choose a middle tile that has the best probability of being a safe, information-revealing move.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nRationale:\n1. The middle of the board (4,4) gives a good chance of revealing multiple empty spaces or a low-numbered tile\n2. This move avoids the potentially risky edges and corners\n3. It provides maximum information with minimal risk\n4. By revealing a central tile, we maximize the chances of creating an open area that helps us understand the bomb distribution\n\nThis is a standard opening strategy in Minesweeper that helps create an initial safe space to work from.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

At (5,5), we have a '1' with several adjacent empty spaces. This suggests a potential bomb nearby.\n\n2. The region around (5,5) to (6,6) looks particularly interesting. We have some revealed numbers that can help us deduce bomb locations.\n\n3. The '1' at (4,4) and the '1' at (1,5) suggest we can strategically place some flags.\n\nI'm going to first reveal a tile that seems low-risk. The cluster around (5,5) looks promising for gaining more information.\n\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n\nThe reasoning is that this tile is next to the '1' at (5,5), which means if this tile was a bomb, the '1' would already be satisfied. By revealing this, we'll either get:\n- A number that helps us further understand the bomb layout\n- An empty space that gives us more board visibility\n- Minimal risk of hitting a bomb\n\nMy move is conservative but calculated to give us more board information.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ _\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _\n4 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n5 . . 2 _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n6 . . 3 1 1 . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
