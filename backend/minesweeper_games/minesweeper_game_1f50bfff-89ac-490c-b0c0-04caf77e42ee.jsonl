{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The board is completely unexplored, all squares are dots. The game is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining. Since there's no information revealed yet, I need to make a first move. The usual strategy in Minesweeper is to start by clicking a corner or the center, but since all squares are the same here, maybe the best bet is to pick a spot that's likely to give the most information.\n\nWait, but in Minesweeper, the first click is always safe, right? So the game probably ensures that the first click isn't a bomb. So I can safely reveal any square. But the user's note here says that the game ends if you reveal a bomb. So maybe in this scenario, the first move could be a bomb, but according to standard Minesweeper rules, the first click is safe. Hmm, but the problem statement here might not follow that rule. Wait, the GAME INFO says Bombs: 10. So there are 10 bombs on the board. But the initial state is all unexplored. So the user's first move could hit a bomb. But in actual Minesweeper, the first click is never a bomb. But maybe in this problem, the user is supposed to play as if the first click could be a bomb. Wait, but the problem says \"the game ends if you reveal a bomb\". So if the first move is a bomb, the game ends. But since the user has to make a move, and there's no prior information, how can they proceed?\n\nWait, maybe the initial state here is that all squares are unexplored, but the bombs are placed in such a way that the first click is safe. But the problem statement doesn't specify that. So perhaps in this scenario, the user has to take a risk. But that's not how Minesweeper works. So maybe the problem assumes that the first click is safe. But the user's code here might not know that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is supposed to start by revealing a square, and if it's a bomb, the game ends. But since there are 10 bombs on a 10x10 board, the chance is 10/100 = 10% for any square. But that's a high risk. But in actual Minesweeper, the first click is safe. So perhaps the problem here is following that rule. But the problem statement doesn't mention that. So maybe the user has to proceed under the assumption that the first click could be a bomb. But that's not helpful. \n\nWait, the problem says \"You are playing a game of Minesweeper.\" So perhaps the standard rules apply. In standard Minesweeper, the first click is always safe. So even though the board is all dots, the first click will never be a bomb. Therefore, the user can safely click any square. So the best approach is to click a square that's in the middle to maximize the chance of getting a number that can help. For example, clicking (5,5) would be a central square. But since all squares are the same here, maybe any choice is okay. \n\nSo the explanation would be that since the board is completely unexplored, the first move is to reveal a central tile to maximize the information gained. The move would be to reveal (5,5) with flag=false. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should start at a corner. But in standard Minesweeper, starting in the corner can sometimes lead to more constrained situations. But since all squares are the same here, the first move is arbitrary. But the safest approach is to pick a central square. \n\nSo the move would be to reveal (5,5). That's the middle of the 10x10 grid. Coordinates (5,5) would be row 5, column 5. So the move is x=5, y=5, flag=false.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Since the entire board is unexplored, the first move must be to reveal a tile. Choosing the center (5,5) maximizes the potential information gained from adjacent tiles once revealed. \n\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
