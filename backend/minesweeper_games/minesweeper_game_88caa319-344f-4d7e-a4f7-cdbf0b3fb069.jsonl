Currently, the board is completely unexplored (all spaces are represented by \".\"). I need to make my first move.\n\nIn Minesweeper, the first move is always safe (the game ensures this), so I should reveal a tile rather than place a flag. The best strategy for the first move is typically to click in the middle of the board, as this gives the highest chance of revealing a large area if there are no bombs nearby.\n\nSo, I'll choose a position near the center of the board. Since the board is 10x10, the center would be around coordinates (4,4) or (5,5). Either of these would be a good choice for the first move.\n\nI'll go with (4,4) as my first move, which is revealing (not flagging) the tile at row 4, column 4.\n\nMy explanation will be that this is the first move, and choosing a central position is the best strategy to maximize the chances of opening up a large area.\n</think>\n# First Move Strategy for Minesweeper\n\nEXPLANATION: For the first move in Minesweeper, it's best to choose a tile near the center of the board. This maximizes the chance of opening a large area if there are no bombs nearby. The first click in Minesweeper is always safe by design (the game ensures you won't hit a mine on your first move).\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nI'm selecting row 4, column 4 (near the center of the board) to reveal.
