{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by understanding the current state. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs remaining, with 10 flags left to place. All the squares are currently unexplored, marked with dots. \n\nSince I'm just starting, I don't have any numbers or flags yet. The first move in Minesweeper is usually a bit of a gamble because there's no information to go on. I remember that the best strategy is to reveal a square, and based on the number that appears, start deducing where the bombs might be. \n\nI need to choose a starting position. Typically, people might start in the middle or near the edges. But since all squares are the same, it doesn't really matter. I'll just pick a random square to start with. Let's say I choose (0,0), the top-left corner. \n\nSo, I'll reveal (0,0). If it's a bomb, the game ends, but the chance is low since there are 10 bombs out of 100 squares. If it's a number, that will give me some information. But since I can't see the result yet, I have to proceed with my initial move. \n\nWait, actually, in the problem statement, the board is completely unexplored, so I don't have any numbers yet. Therefore, my first move must be to reveal a square. I can't place a flag because I don't have any information yet. \n\nSo, I'll choose to reveal (0,0). If it's a bomb, that's bad, but I have to take that risk. If it's a number, say 3, then I know there are three bombs around it. But without any prior information, I can't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the probability. The first square has a 10% chance of being a bomb. It's a risk, but necessary. \n\nAlternatively, some strategies suggest revealing the center squares first because they have more adjacent squares, which can give more information. But since all squares are the same, it's arbitrary. \n\nIn any case, I'll proceed with revealing (0,0). So, my move is to reveal (0,0). \n\nWait, but the problem says I have to provide a move. So, I need to choose a square to reveal or flag. Since all squares are unexplored, I can't place a flag yet because I don't have any information. So, I have to reveal a square. \n\nI think I'll choose (5,5), the center. Maybe that's a better starting point because it has more adjacent squares, which can help in deducing the layout. \n\nBut honestly, any square is fine. Since I'm just starting, I'll go with (0,0). \n\nSo, my move is to reveal (0,0). \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the board is 10x10, and I have to provide the move in the format x,y,flag. So, flag is false because I'm revealing it. \n\nSo, the move is 0,0,false. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should think again. Since I'm just starting, maybe I should pick a corner. Corners have only three adjacent squares, so if I reveal a corner and it shows a number, it's easier to manage. \n\nFor example, if I reveal (0,0) and it shows a 1, then I know there's one bomb in the adjacent squares. Since (0,0) has only three neighbors: (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). So, if it's a 1, I can flag one of those. \n\nAlternatively, if it's a 3, all three adjacent squares are bombs. \n\nSo, perhaps starting with a corner is better because it gives more manageable information. \n\nTherefore, I'll choose to reveal (0,0). \n\nSo, my move is to reveal (0,0), which is x=0, y=0, flag=false. \n\nI think that's the best starting point. Let's go with that.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Starting with the top-left corner (0,0) to reveal a square and gather initial information about adjacent bombs.\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
