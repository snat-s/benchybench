{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Since this is the start of the game with a completely unexplored board, the best strategy is to start with a corner or edge move. Corner moves are particularly good as they minimize the number of adjacent tiles (only 3 possible bomb locations instead of 8 for most other positions).\n\nI'll choose the top-left corner (0,0) for my first move. This is a common starting strategy in Minesweeper because:\n1. It minimizes risk (only 3 adjacent squares)\n2. If it reveals a number, it gives us clear information about a limited area\n3. If it reveals an empty space, it often cascades to reveal a larger area\n\nEXPLANATION: Starting with top-left corner as it's one of the safest opening moves with only 3 adjacent tiles that could contain bombs.\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
