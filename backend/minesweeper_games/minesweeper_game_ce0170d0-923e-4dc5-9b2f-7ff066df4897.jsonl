We focus on numbers and their adjacent tiles to ensure they correspond correctly to the number of bombs. In the board, the number '1' in position (0,2) has two unexplored tiles adjacent: (0,1) and (0,3). Since one bomb is indicated, one of these tiles must contain a bomb. Similarly, the number '1' in position (1,4) suggests a bomb adjacent to it among its unexplored tiles (1,3) and (0,3). This suggests that tile (0,3) is a definitive bomb. Hence, we will flag tile (0,3).\n\nMOVE: 0,3,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 1 2 . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n4 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . . .\n5 . 1 _ _ 1 . . . . .\n6 1 1 _ 1 2 . . . . .\n7 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n8 1 1 1 1 . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

It already has a flag placed at (0,3), which means there are no additional bombs adjacent to this number. \n\n2. Now let's consider the tile (1,4) which displays a '2'. It has one flagged tile at (0,3), meaning one more bomb must be adjacent to (1,4) to satisfy the '2'. Possible candidates for this additional bomb are (0,4), (1,3), (2,3), and (2,4). Tile (1,3) is a '1', meaning it already has one bomb adjacent in its surrounding 8 tiles (the flag at (0,3)) and cannot have additional bombs adjacent. It's safe to assume (1,3) isn't a bomb.\n\n3. Let's look at tile (1,2) which is a '1'. Currently, there are no adjacent flags around (1,2), which indicates one of its neighboring tiles is a bomb. The safe assumption is that (0,1) or (0,3) already being a flag means there is no necessity for another flag around (1,2).\n\n4. For the tile (3,4), which is a '1', only has a single unrevealed tile (4,4) adjacent. Since it must have one bomb, we determine that (4,4) must be a bomb.\n\nFollowing these analyses, the safe move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: Tile (4,4) is adjacent to a single number '1' at position (3,4), indicating exactly one bomb in its surrounding 8 tiles, and (4,4) is the only unexplored tile around it, confirming it must contain a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,true (place a flag at (4,4))", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 F . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 1 2 . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n4 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . . .\n5 . 1 _ _ 1 . . . . .\n6 1 1 _ 1 2 . . . . .\n7 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n8 1 1 1 1 . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Hence, there must be at least one more bomb in the remaining adjacent unexplored spaces at (0, 4) or (1, 5).\n\nTo minimize risk, let's focus on revealing tiles that have no conflict with the number's conditions.

Hence, the remaining bomb for this '2' should not affect unexplored area at (7, 3) directly:\n- The unexplored tile at (7, 4) is a safer option as it is only adjacent to one known bomb and satisfies (6, 4). \n\nMOVE: 7,4,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 F . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 1 2 . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n4 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . . .\n5 . 1 _ _ 1 . . . . .\n6 1 1 _ 1 2 . . . . .\n7 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n8 1 1 1 1 . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
