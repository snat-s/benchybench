However, we also notice that the revealed '1' at position (6,5) already has an adjacent flag, so there cannot be another bomb next to it. This means that the bomb adjacent to the '3' at position (7,6) must be at position (8,5) or (6,7) is not possible due to the '1' at (6,5), but since (8,5) is already flagged we look at (7,5) but we see a '1' at (6,4) with only 1 flag so far at (5,5) so we cannot place a flag at (7,5). We look at (6,7) and see it is already flagged so we look at (7,7) and see it is a '2' with 2 flags so far so we cannot place a flag next to it so we look at (8,7) and see a '2' with 2 flags so far so we cannot place a flag next to it so we look at (7,8) and see a '1' with 1 flag so far at (8,8) so we cannot place a flag at (7,8) so we look at (6,8) and see a '.' and we see a '1' at (5,8) with 1 flag so far at (5,7) so we cannot place a flag at (6,8) but we see a '1' at (7,9) with 1 flag so far at (8,9) so we cannot place a flag next to it so we look at (6,9) and see a '.' with a '1' at (5,9) with 1 flag so far at (5,8) no we cannot place a flag at (6,9) but we see a '1' at (7,9) with 1 flag so far at (8,9) so we cannot place a flag next to it so we look at (6,9) and see a '.' with a '1' at (5,9) with 1 flag so far at (5,8) no we cannot place a flag at (6,9) so we look at (4,9) and see a '1' with 1 flag so far at (5,9) so we cannot place a flag next to it so we look at (4,8) and see a '1' with 1 flag so far at (5,8) so we cannot place a flag next to it so we look at (3,9) and see a '.' with a '1' at (3,8) with 1 flag so far at (4,8) no we cannot place a flag at (3,9) but we see a '1' at (2,9) with 1 flag so far at (3,9) no we cannot place a flag next to it so we look at (3,9) and see a '.' with a '1' at (3,8) with 1 flag so far at (4,8) no we cannot place a flag at (3,9) so we look at (2,8) and see a '1' with 1 flag so far at (3,8) so we cannot place a flag next to it so we look at (1,9) and see a '.' with a '2' at (1,8) with 1 flag so far at (2,8) so we can place a flag next to it.\n\nMOVE: 1,9,true", "flags_remaining": 4, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n1 . . . . 2 _ _ _ _ _\n2 . . . . 1 _ _ F 1 1\n3 1 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n5 _ _ _ _ 1 F 1 _ _ _\n6 _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 F _ _\n7 _ _ 1 . . . 3 F 2 1\n8 _ _ 1 F 2 F . . . .\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": true}

One such area is around the revealed '3' at position (7,6). Since this '3' already has two adjacent flags, we can deduce that the third bomb must be located in one of the remaining adjacent squares. However, we can also see that the revealed '1' at position (7,5) already has an adjacent flag, so the square to its right is likely safe. Therefore, the most likely location for the third bomb is the square above the '3', at position (6,6). However, we can see that this square is already revealed and is not a bomb. The next most likely location is the square to the left of the '3', at position (7,5). However, we can see that this square is adjacent to a '1' that already has a flag, so it is likely safe. Therefore, we will look for other opportunities.\n\nWe can see that the revealed '2' at position (8,4) only has one adjacent flag, so there must be another bomb adjacent to it. The most likely location for this bomb is the square to its left, at position (8,3). However, we can see that this square is already flagged. Therefore, we will look for other opportunities.\n\nWe can see that the revealed '1' at position (3,8) already has an adjacent flag, so the square to its right is likely safe. We can reveal this square to gather more information.\n\nMOVE: 3,9,false", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n1 . . . . 2 _ _ _ _ F\n2 . . . . 1 _ _ F 1 1\n3 1 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1\n5 _ _ _ _ 1 F 1 _ _ _\n6 _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 F _ _\n7 _ _ 1 . . . 3 F 2 1\n8 _ _ 1 F 2 F . . . .\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": false}
