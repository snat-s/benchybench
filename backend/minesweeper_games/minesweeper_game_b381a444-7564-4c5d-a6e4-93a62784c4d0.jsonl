Here as well, there must be exactly one bomb placed adjacent to this tile.\n\n- The tile at (8, 5) shows '3', meaning it needs exactly three bombs adjacent to it. Currently, (7, 5) is confirmed with only one adjacent bomb it requires.\n\nFrom the analysis, we see no immediate conflicts with the flags already placed. Further investigation shows that:\n\n- The safest move now is to reveal (6, 2) as it is adjacent to tiles that are either confirmed flags or numbered tiles with a clear understanding of adjacent flags.\n\nTherefore:\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (6,2) is the best choice as it opens more possible positions and is currently empty with no immediate bomb threats confirmed in that vicinity.\nMOVE: 6,2,false", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . .

It needs one more flag since it shows 2.\n   - Position (2, 5) has a '2' and also needs one flag since there is currently only one flag placed.\n\n2. **Adjacent Numbers to Flags**:\n   - (4, 3): '1' with flag at (6, 5) \u2192 ok, confirms 1 bomb.\n   - (2, 3): '2' with one flag (to the east at (6, 5)) \u2192 needs another bomb in range.\n   - Reviewing the (6, 5) flag, it is adjacent to:\n     - (5, 4): revealed '1'\n     - (5, 5): revealed '1'\n     - (6, 4): revealed '2'\n     - (6, 6): not revealed but within (6,5) and has 2 bombs nearby due to the '1s'.\n\nGiven that there are some clear positions where I can identify bombs based on the flagged areas:\n\n3. **Remaining Flags**: \n   - We have 8 flags remaining to place around bombs that are visibly established.\n\nConsidering the visible data, I can safely reveal adjacent squares around already defined numbers before I consider further flag placements:\n\n- I will reveal the square at (1, 2). The reason is that it's empty and will potentially shed light on many adjacent bomb states (since (1, 3) already indicated a '1').\n\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal tile (1, 2) since it is currently unexplored and will provide more information about nearby bomb placements without conflicting with existing flags. \n\nMOVE: 1,2,false", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ _ 2 . 2 _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ _ 2 . 3 1 _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ 1 F . 1 1 1 1\n5 1 1 1 _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n6 . . 2 2 2 F _ 1 1 1\n7 . 2 3 . . 2 _ _ _ _\n8 . . . . . 3 _ _ _ _\n9 . . . . . 2 _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
