It has flags around it: (6,6) and (7,8) the '2' at (5,4) has revealed numbers which are 1 at (6,2) and 1 at (7,2). The 2 at (5,4) needs to have two bombs around it. We see that the 3 at (5,6) needs to have 3 bombs around it and there is a flag at (6,6), and the one at (6,2) means there should be a bomb at (7,2).\nThere needs to be one more flag.\n\nThe 3 at (5,6) needs 3 bombs. The already placed flag at (6,6) means there are two more that need to be flagged. The two numbers next to this are 2 and 1. The 2 tells us there are two bombs around this. So the 2 at (7,7) should have one bomb around.\nThe 1 at (6,2) means the adjacent tiles to it needs to have one bomb and the 1 at (7,2) says this also has a bomb.\nThe one possible place for the bomb, relative to the 2, is (7,7) as it has two bombs, so there is another spot, this would be (7,8)\n\nConsidering these factors, and the current distribution of flags and revealed numbers, the unexplored space (6,7) seems to have a higher chance of being a bomb. The other space (7,7) has a '2' and there should be at least one more bomb next to it, we can place the flag there.\n\nMOVE: 7,7,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 1 2 . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ 2 . . . . .\n4 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n5 _ _ _ 1 2 3 2 3 . .\n6 _ _ 1 2 . 1 _ 2 . .\n7 _ _ 1 . 2 1 _ 1 2 2\n8 _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
