Its surroundings are consistent as it currently has an indication only of '1' next to revealed areas.\n\n**Final Move Proposal**:\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal the square at (3,3) to gather further information about adjacent bombs, as exploring unexplored areas may help clarify potential conflicts with flagged areas.\nMOVE: 3,3,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 1 . . . . . . .\n1 F 1 1 1 . . . . . .\n2 1 1 1 . . . . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n4 _ _ 1 1 1 1 1 2 . .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n6 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n7 _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ 1 1 1\n8 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": false}
