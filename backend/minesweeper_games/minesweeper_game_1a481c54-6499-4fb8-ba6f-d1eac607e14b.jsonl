{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the information given. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs. The user hasn't placed any flags yet since all the squares are either unexplored (.) or empty (_). The flags remaining are 10, which is the same as the number of bombs, so every bomb must be flagged eventually.\n\nSince the entire board is unexplored, there's no revealed numbers or flags to go by. I can't apply any of the critical flag placement rules because I don't have any information yet. So, the logical first step is to start revealing squares to get some numbers to work with.\n\nRevealing a square can either show a number (indicating adjacent bombs) or a bomb (which would end the game). But since I'm just starting, it's safer to pick a spot that's less likely to be a bomb. Typically, the corners and edges have fewer adjacent squares, so maybe starting there could be a good idea.\n\nLooking at the coordinate system, (0,0) is the top-left corner. It's a corner, so it only has three adjacent squares: (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). Revealing this might give me a low number, which would help me start deducing where the bombs are. Alternatively, if it's a 0, that would be even better because it would reveal a lot of safe squares around it.\n\nI could also consider that since the board is symmetric, starting in the middle might give more information, but without any revealed squares, the middle is just as risky as any other spot. So, the corner seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nI don't think placing a flag is the right move here because I have no information to base it on. Placing a flag without knowing where the bombs are could lead to incorrect flag placements, which would cause conflicts with the numbers once I start revealing them.\n\nSo, the next move should be to reveal a square. Let's go with (0,0). If it's a number, I can use that to inform my next steps. If it's a bomb, the game ends, but that's a risk I have to take.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Since the board is completely unexplored, the first move should be to reveal a square to gather information. Starting with a corner is a safe choice as it has fewer adjacent squares, potentially leading to a lower number or a 0, which would be helpful.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
