{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs, and I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after making this move, the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '3'. That means there are 3 bombs adjacent to this cell. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nSince it's my first move and I have no other information, I should flag the cells that are likely to be bombs based on this number. But I need to be careful not to overflag or underflag.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total, I need to use them wisely. Each flag I place should be as accurate as possible.\n\nLet's say I decide to flag three cells adjacent to the '3'. But which three? I need to look at the board and see if any of these adjacent cells are already revealed or have numbers that can give me more information.\n\nAssuming that no other cells are revealed yet, I can choose to flag any three of the eight adjacent cells. For now, I'll choose to flag (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5).\n\nSo, my next moves would be:\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\n\nMOVE: 3,4,true\n\nMOVE: 4,3,true\n\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged three cells, and I have 7 flags left. Next, I should reveal another cell that is not adjacent to the initial reveal to try to expand the board further.\n\nLet's choose (6,6) as another safe starting point.\n\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\n\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\nSuppose this reveals a '1'. Now, there is only one bomb adjacent to (6,6). The adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nI need to see if any of these are already flagged or revealed. Assuming none are flagged yet, I'll flag one of them, say (6,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\n\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged four cells, and I have 6 flags left.\n\nContinuing this process, I need to look for more numbers and adjust my flags accordingly. If I reveal a cell and it shows a '0', that means there are no bombs adjacent to it, and the game should automatically reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nLet's say I reveal (5,4) and it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nI already have flags on (4,3), (4,5), and (6,5). So, out of the eight adjacent cells to (5,4), three are flagged. The number '2' means only two of them are bombs. This suggests that one of the flagged cells is not a bomb, which is a conflict.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If '2' means exactly two adjacent bombs, and I have three flags on adjacent cells, then one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. Therefore, I need to remove one flag from the adjacent cells of (5,4).\n\nSo, I need to unflag one of the cells: (4,3), (4,5), or (6,5). But I need to choose wisely.\n\nLooking at the board, if I unflag (6,5), and assuming that (6,5) is not a bomb, then the '1' at (6,6) would still need one flag, so maybe (6,7) should be flagged.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (3,3). Suppose it shows a '1'. Adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nI have a flag on (3,4) and (4,3). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (3,3). But the '1' indicates only one adjacent bomb. Therefore, one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. So, I need to unflag one of them.\n\nThis suggests that either (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb. But earlier, based on the '3' at (4,4), I flagged (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5). Now, if one of (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb, then perhaps (4,5) is the actual bomb.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (5,5). Suppose it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nI have flags on (4,5) and (6,5). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (5,5). The '2' means exactly two bombs adjacent, so the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (4,6), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,6) safely.\n\nLet's reveal (4,6). Suppose it shows a '0'. Then, the game should auto-reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nNow, the board has expanded in that area, giving me more information.\n\nContinuing this process, revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers, I can progress through the game.\n\nIt's important to keep track of the number of flags left and the number of potential bombs still to be flagged.\n\nAlso, sometimes, I might need to make educated guesses when there isn't enough information to be certain, but that can be risky.\n\nIn summary, my strategy is to:\n\n1. Make initial safe moves to start revealing the board.\n\n2. Flag cells based on the numbers revealed, ensuring that the number of flags matches the numbers.\n\n3. Reveal cells that are likely safe based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\n4. Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n5. Continue this process until all bombs are flagged or all safe cells are revealed.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this Minesweeper problem, we need to methodically reveal safe cells and flag bombs based on the numbers revealed, which indicate how many bombs are adjacent to each cell. Here is a step-by-step approach to playing the game:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - The first move is safe, so choose a central cell to maximize the area revealed.\n   - Based on the number revealed, flag the appropriate number of adjacent cells as bombs.\n\n2. **Expand the Board**:\n   - Choose another safe cell away from the initial move to further expand the revealed area.\n   - Continue flagging cells based on the numbers revealed.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If a number indicates fewer bombs than the flags placed, remove flags accordingly.\n   - Ensure that the number of flags around each numbered cell matches the number shown.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n6. **Completion**:\n   - The game is won by either revealing all safe cells or correctly flagging all bombs.\n\n### Solution Code Structure\n\nSince Minesweeper is an interactive problem, the solution involves a series of moves based on the board's state, which is updated after each move. Therefore, the solution is presented as a sequence of moves with explanations.\n\n### Example Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\n# Move 1: Initial safe move at center\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '3'\n# Flag three adjacent cells\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\nMOVE: 3,4,true\nMOVE: 4,3,true\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\n# Move 2: Another safe move away from initial reveal\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '1'\n# Flag one adjacent cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\n# Move 3: Reveal a new cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another cell to get more information.\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '2'\n# Adjust flags based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Adjust flags around '2' at (5,4).\n# If conflict, unflag one cell\nMOVE: 4,5,false  # Unflag if necessary\n\n# Move 4: Reveal a safe cell based on '2'\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a safe cell adjacent to '2'.\nMOVE: 4,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '0'\n# Auto-reveal neighbors\nEXPLANATION: '0' at (4,6), auto-revealing neighbors.\n\n# Continue this process until the game is solved.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - Start with a safe move at the center to maximize reveal.\n   - Flag adjacent cells based on the number revealed.\n\n2. **Expanding the Board**:\n   - Make another safe move away from the initial reveal to get more information.\n   - Flag cells accordingly based on new revelations.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If flags exceed the number indicated, remove flags from likely safe cells.\n   - Ensure consistency between flags and numbers.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust strategy as new information is revealed to avoid conflicts and progress towards solving the board.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Let's start from the top left and work our way across.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Column 6 has a '1'. That means there's one bomb somewhere around it.

Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at row 4:\n\n- (4,0): '1'\n\n- (4,1): '2'\n\n- (4,2): '1'\n\n- (4,3): '1'\n\n- (4,4): '_'\n\n- (4,5): '_'\n\n- (4,6): '_'\n\n- (4,7): '1'\n\n- (4,8): '.'\n\n- (4,9): '.'\n\nAround (4,0):\n\n- (3,0): '_'\n\n- (3,1): '_'\n\n- (4,1): '2'\n\n- (5,0): '.'\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\nSo, (4,0) is a '1', meaning one of these surrounding squares has a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is a '2', so two of its surrounding squares have bombs.\n\nLet's list the surrounding squares for (4,1):\n\n- (3,0): '_'\n\n- (3,1): '_'\n\n- (3,2): '_'\n\n- (4,0): '1'\n\n- (4,2): '1'\n\n- (5,0): '.'\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\n- (5,2): '.'\n\nSo, out of these, two have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is a '1', so one of its surrounding squares has a bomb.\n\nSurrounding squares for (4,2):\n\n- (3,1): '_'\n\n- (3,2): '_'\n\n- (3,3): '_'\n\n- (4,1): '2'\n\n- (4,3): '1'\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\n- (5,2): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '.'\n\nSo, one of these has a bomb.\n\nAnd (4,3) is a '1', so one of its surrounding squares has a bomb.\n\nSurrounding squares for (4,3):\n\n- (3,2): '_'\n\n- (3,3): '_'\n\n- (3,4): '_'\n\n- (4,2): '1'\n\n- (4,4): '_'\n\n- (5,2): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '.'\n\n- (5,4): '.'\n\nOne of these has a bomb.\n\nNow, looking at (4,6), which is a '_'.

Maybe I should look for squares that are definitely safe or definitely bombs.\n\nLooking at (4,6), which is empty ('_'), so none of its surrounding squares have bombs.\n\nSurrounding squares for (4,6):\n\n- (3,5): '_'\n\n- (3,6): '_'\n\n- (3,7): '_'\n\n- (4,5): '_'\n\n- (4,7): '1'\n\n- (5,5): '.'\n\n- (5,6): '.'\n\n- (5,7): '.'\n\nSince none of these have bombs, I can safely reveal (5,5), (5,6), and (5,7).\n\nWait, but (5,7) is already revealed as '2', so I've already revealed it. But (5,5) and (5,6) are unexplored, so I can reveal them safely.\n\nBut before doing that, I should check if there are any flags already placed in these areas, but according to the board, there are no flags in these positions.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal (5,5) and (5,6).\n\nBut let's see, (5,5) and (5,6) are both unexplored, and since (4,6) is empty, these should be safe.\n\nBut wait, (5,7) is a '2', and if I reveal (5,5) and (5,6), I need to make sure that doesn't conflict with the '2'.\n\nBut since (4,6) is empty, none of its surroundings have bombs, which includes (5,5), (5,6), and (5,7).

If (4,6) is empty, then (5,5), (5,6), and (5,7) are safe, but (5,7) is a '2', which means that the bombs are in its surrounding squares, but not in (5,5) and (5,6).\n\nSo, the bombs for (5,7)'s '2' must be among:\n\n- (4,6): safe (empty)\n\n- (4,7): '1'\n\n- (4,8): '.'\n\n- (5,6): safe\n\n- (5,8): '.'\n\n- (6,6): '_'\n\n- (6,7): '_'\n\n- (6,8): '.'\n\nSo, the two bombs must be among (4,7), (4,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8).\n\nBut (4,7) is a '1', so only one bomb among its surroundings.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just reveal (5,5) and (5,6) since they should be safe.\n\nBut to be cautious, perhaps I should reveal (5,5) first.\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the empty tile at (4,6), which indicates no adjacent bombs, I can safely reveal (5,5).\n\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 3 . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 3 4 . .\n4 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . . .\n5 . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 . .\n6 1 2 1 1 _ _ _ 1 . .\n7 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n8 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": true}

If (4,6) is empty, then (5,5), (5,6), and (5,7) are safe, but (5,7) is a '2', which means that the bombs are in its surrounding squares, but not in (5,5) and (5,6).\n\nSo, the bombs for (5,7)'s '2' must be among:\n\n- (4,6): safe (empty)\n\n- (4,7): '1'\n\n- (4,8): '.'\n\n- (5,6): safe\n\n- (5,8): '.'\n\n- (6,6): '_'\n\n- (6,7): '_'\n\n- (6,8): '.'\n\nSo, the two bombs must be among (4,7), (4,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8).\n\nBut (4,7) is a '1', so only one bomb among its surroundings.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated.

So, the bomb for (1,6)'s '1' must be at (0,5) or (2,5).\n\nBut (0,5) and (2,5) are both unexplored.\n\nWait, but (0,5) is not present in the board, because the board starts from (0,0) to (9,9), so (0,5) is valid.\n\nWait, looking back at the board:\n\nRow 0:\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 3 . . .\n\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 1 3 4 . .\n\n4 1 2 1 1 _ _ 1 . . .\n\n5 . . . 1 _ _ 1 2 . .\n\n6 1 2 1 1 _ _ _ 1 . .\n\n7 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n\n8 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n\nWait, row 0, column 5 is '_', which is revealed, so no bomb there.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 0:\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n\nSo, positions (0,0) to (0,9):\n\n- (0,0): '_'\n\n- (0,1): '_'\n\n- (0,2): '_'\n\n- (0,3): '_'\n\n- (0,4): '_'\n\n- (0,5): '_'\n\n- (0,6): '_'\n\n- (0,7): '1'\n\n- (0,8): '.'\n\n- (0,9): '.'\n\nWait, (0,5) is '_', which is revealed, so no bomb there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is '_', which is also revealed, so no bomb there.\n\nTherefore, for (1,6)'s '1', the only possible adjacent bomb is at (1,5), but (1,5) is '_', which is revealed, so no bomb there.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I need to double-check the board.\n\nWait, in row 1:\n\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 3 . . .\n\nSo, (1,5) is '_', which is revealed, so no bomb there.\n\nWait, but (1,6) is '1', and its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,5): '_', no bomb\n\n- (0,6): '1', no bomb\n\n- (0,7): '1', no bomb\n\n- (1,5): '_', no bomb\n\n- (1,7): '3', no bomb\n\n- (2,5): '_', no bomb\n\n- (2,6): '1', no bomb\n\n- (2,7): '1', no bomb\n\nSo, all adjacent squares to (1,6) are revealed and safe, but (1,6) shows '1', which means there should be one bomb adjacent to it. But all adjacent squares are safe. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the adjacency. In Minesweeper, adjacency includes diagonals.\n\nSo, (1,6) is '1', and its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,5): '_'\n\n- (0,6): '1'\n\n- (0,7): '1'\n\n- (1,5): '_'\n\n- (1,7): '3'\n\n- (2,5): '_'\n\n- (2,6): '1'\n\n- (2,7): '1'\n\nNone of these are flagged, and all are revealed as safe. So, according to the game, there should be one bomb among these eight squares, but they are all safe. That's confusing.\n\nUnless the bomb is actually in one of the unexplored squares that I haven't considered.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look again.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier assumption. Maybe I misread the board.\n\nLooking back at row 1:\n\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 3 . . .\n\nSo, columns 0 to 9:\n\n- (1,0): '_'\n\n- (1,1): '_'\n\n- (1,2): '_'\n\n- (1,3): '_'\n\n- (1,4): '_'\n\n- (1,5): '_'\n\n- (1,6): '1'\n\n- (1,7): '3'\n\n- (1,8): '.'\n\n- (1,9): '.'\n\nSimilarly, row 0:\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n\nSo, (0,6): '1', (0,7): '1', (0,8): '.', (0,9): '.'\n\nRow 2:\n\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n\nSo, (2,6): '1', (2,7): '.', (2,8): '.', (2,9): '.'\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the possibility that some squares are not correctly identified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the area around (7,4):\n\n(7,4): '1', which has one bomb around it.\n\nAround (7,4):\n\n- (6,3): '1'\n\n- (6,4): '1'\n\n- (6,5): '_'\n\n- (7,3): '1'\n\n- (7,5): '1'\n\n- (8,3): '1'\n\n- (8,4): '1'\n\n- (8,5): '.'\n\nOnly (6,5) and (8,5) are unexplored.\n\nSo, one bomb is either at (6,5) or (8,5).\n\nSimilarly, (7,5): '1', which has one bomb around it.\n\nAround (7,5):\n\n- (6,4): '1'\n\n- (6,5): '_'\n\n- (6,6): '_'\n\n- (7,4): '1'\n\n- (7,6): '1'\n\n- (8,4): '1'\n\n- (8,5): '.'\n\n- (8,6): '.'\n\nUnexplored squares: (6,5), (6,6), (8,5), (8,6).\n\nBut from (7,4), we know that only (6,5) and (8,5) can have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, (7,5)'s '1' must have one bomb among its adjacent squares.\n\nGiven that (6,5) and (8,5) are the only possible bomb locations around (7,4), and (7,5) shares (6,5) and (8,5) as adjacent squares, it's possible that one of them is a bomb.\n\nBut (7,5) has a '1', meaning only one bomb around it.\n\nSo, if (6,5) is a bomb, then (8,5) is safe, and vice versa.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine which one is the bomb.\n\nMaybe I need to look at another number connected to these squares.\n\nLooking at (6,5): It's unexplored, and it's adjacent to (6,4): '1', (6,6): '_', (7,4): '1', (7,5): '1'.\n\nWait, (6,6) is '_', which is safe.\n\nSo, for (6,4): '1', which has one bomb around it.\n\nAround (6,4):\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\n- (5,4): '1'\n\n- (5,5): '_'\n\n- (6,3): '1'\n\n- (6,5): '_'\n\n- (7,3): '1'\n\n- (7,4): '1'\n\n- (7,5): '1'\n\nUnexplored squares: (5,5) and (6,5).\n\nSo, one bomb is either at (5,5) or (6,5).\n\nBut earlier, from (7,4), we have that one bomb is at either (6,5) or (8,5).\n\nSo, combining these:\n\n- From (6,4): one bomb at (5,5) or (6,5)\n\n- From (7,4): one bomb at (6,5) or (8,5)\n\nTherefore, there must be a bomb at (6,5), because it's the common square in both possibilities.\n\nSo, I should flag (6,5) as a bomb.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf I flag (6,5), then:\n\n- (6,4)'s '1' is satisfied (one bomb adjacent)\n\n- (7,4)'s '1' is satisfied (one bomb adjacent)\n\n- (7,5)'s '1' would also be satisfied if (6,5) is a bomb.\n\nWait, but (7,5)'s '1' has adjacent squares:\n\n- (6,4): '1' (safe)\n\n- (6,5): flagged as bomb\n\n- (6,6): '_' (safe)\n\n- (7,4): '1' (safe)\n\n- (7,6): '1' (safe)\n\n- (8,4): '1' (safe)\n\n- (8,5): '.'

(unexplored)\n\nSo, (7,6)'s '1' has one bomb adjacent, which is at (6,5), so no more bombs around it.\n\nTherefore, (8,6) and (8,7) are safe.\n\nSimilarly, (7,7): '1', with adjacent squares:\n\n- (6,6): '_'\n\n- (6,7): '1'\n\n- (6,8): '1'\n\n- (7,6): '1'\n\n- (7,8): '1'\n\n- (8,6): '.'
