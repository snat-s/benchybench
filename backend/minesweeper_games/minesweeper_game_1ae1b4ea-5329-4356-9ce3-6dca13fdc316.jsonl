The optimal starting point is typically a corner or the center, as these positions provide the most information about the board.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "EXPLANATION: Let's analyze the current state of the board. We have three revealed numbers: a '2' at (4,5), a '1' at (4,6), and a '2' at (5,5), a '1' at (5,6), and a '1' at (6,4), a '2' at (6,5), and a '2' at (6,6). \n\nStarting with the '1' at (4,6): The adjacent squares to this tile are (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), and (5,7). The '2' at (4,5) already indicates two bombs in its adjacent squares, and since (4,6) is adjacent to (4,5), it's likely that one of the bombs for (4,5) is in (3,5) or (3,6). Therefore, the '1' at (4,6) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares, which is already accounted for by the '2' at (4,5). This means that none of the other adjacent squares to (4,6) can contain bombs. \n\nLooking at the '1' at (5,6): The adjacent squares are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), and (6,7). The '2' at (5,5) already indicates two bombs adjacent to it, which are likely in (4,5) and (4,6). Therefore, the '1' at (5,6) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares, which is already accounted for by the '2' at (5,5). This means that none of the other adjacent squares to (5,6) can contain bombs.\n\nConsidering the '1' at (6,4): The adjacent squares are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), and (7,5). The '2' at (6,5) already indicates two bombs adjacent to it, which are likely in (5,5) and (5,6). Therefore, the '1' at (6,4) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares, which is already accounted for by the '2' at (6,5). This means that none of the other adjacent squares to (6,4) can contain bombs.\n\nBased on this analysis, the squares (3,7), (5,7), and (6,3) are safe to reveal because they cannot contain bombs according to the numbers and their adjacent flags.\n\nMOVE: 3,7,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . 2 1 . . .\n5 . . . . . 2 1 . . .\n6 . . . . 1 2 2 . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
