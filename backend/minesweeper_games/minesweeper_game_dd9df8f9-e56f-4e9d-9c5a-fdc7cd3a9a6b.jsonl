{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 1, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "### Step 1: Understanding the Current Board State\n\nFirst, I'll take a close look at the current state of the Minesweeper board to understand where the revealed numbers, flags, and unexplored spaces are located.\n\n**Board Layout:**\n\n```\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0  . . F . . . . . . .\n1  . . 1 1 2 . . . . .\n2  . . 1 _ 1 . . . . .\n3  . 2 1 _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n4  1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n5  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n6  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n7  _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1\n8  1 2 1 1 _ 1 . . . .\n9  . . . 1 _ 1 . . . .\n```\n\n**Legend:**\n- `.`: Unexplored space\n- `F`: Flagged space\n- `_`: Empty revealed space\n- `1-8`: Number indicating adjacent bombs\n\nFrom this, I can see that there's one flag at position (0,2). There are numbers scattered across the board, which provide clues about the locations of adjacent bombs.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Flag at (0,2)\n\nThe flag at (0,2) suggests that there's a bomb there. However, I need to verify if this placement is correct based on the surrounding numbers.\n\n**Adjacent Tiles to (0,2):**\n- (0,1)\n- (0,3)\n- (1,1)\n- (1,2)\n- (1,3)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n- (1,2) has a `1`, indicating there's exactly one bomb in its adjacent tiles.\n\nGiven that (0,2) is flagged as a bomb, this aligns with the `1` at (1,2), meaning there should be no other bombs adjacent to (1,2) besides (0,2).\n\n### Step 3: Exploring the Number `1` at (1,2)\n\nSince (1,2) shows a `1` and there's already a flag at (0,2), I can deduce that:\n- There are no other bombs adjacent to (1,2).\n\n**Adjacent Tiles to (1,2):**\n- (0,1)\n- (0,2) \u2013 Flagged\n- (0,3)\n- (1,1)\n- (1,3)\n- (2,1)\n- (2,2)\n- (2,3)\n\nFrom this, I can safely reveal all these adjacent tiles except for (0,2), which is flagged.\n\n### Step 4: Revealing Safe Tiles Adjacent to (1,2)\n\nGiven that (1,2) has only one adjacent bomb (the flagged tile at (0,2)), the following tiles can be safely revealed:\n\n- (0,1)\n- (0,3)\n- (1,1)\n- (1,3)\n- (2,1)\n- (2,2)\n- (2,3)\n\nHowever, looking back at the board:\n- (0,1) and (0,3) are unexplored (`.`).\n- (1,1) is unexplored.\n- (1,3) has a `1`.\n- (2,1) is unexplored.\n- (2,2) is `_` (empty revealed space).\n- (2,3) is `_` (empty revealed space).\n\nSo, the unexplored tiles adjacent to (1,2) that can be safely revealed are:\n- (0,1)\n- (0,3)\n- (1,1)\n- (2,1)\n\n### Step 5: Choosing the Next Move\n\nAmong these, I need to select one to reveal. I'll consider the potential impact of revealing each tile.\n\n**Option 1: Reveal (0,1)**\n- This is a corner tile, which might limit the number of adjacent tiles affected.\n\n**Option 2: Reveal (0,3)**\n- Similar to (0,1), it's a corner tile.\n\n**Option 3: Reveal (1,1)**\n- This tile is adjacent to multiple numbered tiles, which could provide more information.\n\n**Option 4: Reveal (2,1)**\n- This tile is at the edge and adjacent to (1,1) and (2,2).\n\nI think revealing (1,1) might be the most beneficial because it's adjacent to multiple numbered tiles, potentially providing more clues about the surrounding bombs.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Safety of the Chosen Tile\n\nBefore revealing (1,1), I need to ensure that it's indeed safe based on the current information.\n\nLooking at the number at (1,2):\n- It shows `1`, and there's already a flag at (0,2).\n- Therefore, there should be no other bombs adjacent to (1,2).\n\nSince (1,1) is adjacent to (1,2), and there's no indication from other numbers that (1,1) is a bomb, it's safe to reveal.\n\n### Step 7: Making the Move\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll choose to reveal the tile at (1,1).\n\n**Move:**\n```\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (1,1) is safe because (1,2) has a '1' with only one adjacent flag at (0,2), meaning there are no other bombs nearby.\nMOVE: 1,1,false\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (1,1) is safe because (1,2) has a '1' with only one adjacent flag at (0,2), meaning there are no other bombs nearby.\nMOVE: 1,1,false\n```", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . .
