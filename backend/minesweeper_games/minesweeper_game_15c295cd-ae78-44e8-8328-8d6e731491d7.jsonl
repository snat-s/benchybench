In Minesweeper, an initial move is usually a guess because the board is all unexplored. To proceed, I will reveal a tile that is not on the edge to maximize the probability of revealing a large empty area. This approach increases the chance of getting more useful information for subsequent turns, as corner and edge selections typically provide less information.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Currently, there is no adjacent flag, suggesting a bomb might be in one of the adjacent unexplored spaces, primarily at positions (2,2) and (3,2).\n- At (3,3), the number '2' indicates two adjacent bombs. One is flagged adjacent or must be at either position (3,2) or (2,2), but we'd need to explore these further before confirming a flag placement.\n- Position (3,6) has a '1' which could safely have a bomb at one of its unexplored adjacent tiles, specifically (2,6).\n\nGiven the above, I will attempt to reveal a tile with a straightforward interpretation:\nLet's focus on the tile (6,4). Given that (5,4) has already been revealed as '1' and (5,6) has also shown '1', there are unexplored tiles around these that need to be checked, especially since the '1' of (5,4) suggests a bomb is not at (6,4) if it were next to other uncovered tiles.\n\nMOVE: 6,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 . 2 2 2 2 1 _ 1 2 2\n4 . . . . . 1 _ 1 . .\n5 . . . . 3 2 1 1 . .\n6 . . . . 1 . 1 . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "EXPLANATION: Let's analyze the board based on the revealed numbers and unexplored spaces. We particularly focus on the numbers on row 3 and row 4, where some numbers and unexplored spaces are adjacent. We will check for situations where the number of unexplored spaces exactly matches the number of bombs indicated by the numbers, allowing us to either place flags or safely reveal tiles.\n\n1. On row 3, the number '2' at position (3,8) is surrounded by two unexplored tiles: (2,7) and (3,7). Since one bomb is already indicated at (3,8), the unexplored tiles may have one bomb, but it's not distinct enough to flag.\n\n2. The number '2' at position (3,9) similarly surrounded by two unexplored tiles: (2,8) and (3,8). This also indicates one unexplored bomb situation. Both these adjacent '2's at (3,8) and (3,9) imply that both (2,7) (coming vertically from row 2) and (2,8) could be potential flags. However, revealing one could give clarity.\n\n3. Look at space (3,5) which is marked one '1' near two unexplored spaces (4,4 and 4,6). The surrounding situation implies that unexplored space adjacent to (3,6) confounds the situation with (3,4). Among these three, one unexplored space might be a bomb.\n\n4. Since we know (3,5) only has one unexplored bomb space possibly, the unexplored space at (4,6) has same treat. Also, explore (4,7) may help. \n\nGiven the current situation, it's still less risky to try revealing a tile starting leaving new flag. Therefore, revealing unexplored bombard percent stack/reveal reduces risk.\n\nMOVE: 4,6,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 . 2 2 2 2 1 _ 1 2 2\n4 . . . . . 1 _ 1 . .\n5 . . . . 3 2 1 1 . .\n6 . . . . 1 . 1 . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
