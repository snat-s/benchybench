This means there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (0,8).\n   - At position (1,8): Number '2' has one adjacent flag at (1,9). This means there must be one more bomb adjacent to (1,8).\n   - At position (2,8): Number '2' has one adjacent flag at (2,9). This means there must be one more bomb adjacent to (2,8).\n   - At position (3,8): Number '2' has one adjacent flag at (3,9). This means there must be one more bomb adjacent to (3,8).\n   - At position (4,8): Number '1' has one adjacent flag at (4,9). This means there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (4,8).\n\n2. **Look for Obvious Conflicts:**\n   - No obvious conflicts found.\n\n3. **Consider Remaining Flags vs Bombs:**\n   - Flags remaining: 10\n   - Bombs: 10\n   - No flags have been placed yet, so all flags are available.\n\n4. **Decide on Next Move:**\n   - Position (1,7) is unexplored and adjacent to (1,8) (which requires one more bomb). It is a good candidate for revealing or flagging.\n   - Since we need to confirm if it's a bomb, we should reveal it first.\n\n### EXPLANATION:\nRevealing (1,7) will help determine if it is the required bomb for (1,8). If it is a bomb, we can place a flag. If not, it will give us more information about adjacent squares.\n\n### MOVE:\nMOVE: 1,7,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . 1 _\n1 . . . . . . . . 2 _\n2 . . . . . . . . 2 _\n3 . . . 1 1 1 3 . 2 _\n4 . . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n5 . . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}

It has adjacent unexplored tiles at (0,7) and (1,6).\n\n**Step 2: Check for Direct Flag Placements**\n\nUsing the critical flag placement rules:\n\n1. **If a number matches the adjacent flags:** The remaining adjacent tiles are safe to reveal.\n2. **If a number has fewer adjacent flags than required:** There must be additional bombs in the remaining adjacent tiles.\n3. **If a number has more adjacent flags than required:** There is a conflict; the flags are incorrect.\n\n**Applying the Rules:**\n\nLet's take position (0,6) with the number `1`:\n\n- Adjacent tiles: (0,7) and (1,6)\n- Currently, there are no flags adjacent to (0,6)\n- Therefore, one of these adjacent tiles must contain a bomb.\n\n**Step 3: Look for Safe Moves**\n\nI searched for numbered tiles where the number of adjacent flags equals the number on the tile, indicating that all adjacent bombs have been flagged, and the remaining adjacent tiles are safe to reveal.\n\n**Example:**\nAt position (6,0), the number is `1`. Adjacent tiles: (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1).\n\nIf there's a flag at (5,0) and no other adjacent flags, and the number is `1`, then (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1) are safe to reveal.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Potential Bomb Locations**\n\nFor numbered tiles where the number exceeds the adjacent flags, I tried to deduce where the additional bombs must be.\n\n**Example:**\nAt position (1,6), the number is `3`. Adjacent tiles: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7).\n\nAssuming there's already a flag at (0,6), there are still two more bombs to place among the remaining adjacent tiles.\n\n### **Identifying Clear Moves**\n\nAfter analyzing several positions, I looked for the most straightforward moves that don't involve guesswork.\n\n**Move 1: Reveal Safe Tile**\n\nAt position (0,7):\n\n- Adjacent to (0,6) with number `1`\n- No flags adjacent to (0,6)\n- Therefore, (0,7) is likely a safe tile to reveal.\n\n**Move 2: Flagging a Bomb**\n\nAt position (1,6):\n\n- Number `3`\n- Adjacent tiles: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n- Assuming a flag at (0,6), there are still two bombs among the remaining tiles\n- After further analysis, (1,7) seems like a probable bomb location.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nConsidering the analysis, the safest and most logical move is to reveal the tile at (0,7), as it is adjacent to a number `1` with no flags, making it a low-risk choice.\n\n**EXPLANATION:**  \nThe tile at (0,7) is adjacent to the number `1` at (0,6) with no adjacent flags, indicating it's safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:**  \n0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . 1 . 1 _\n1 . . . . . . 3 2 2 _\n2 . . . . . . 3 . 2 _\n3 . . . 1 1 1 3 . 2 _\n4 . . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _\n5 . . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": false}
