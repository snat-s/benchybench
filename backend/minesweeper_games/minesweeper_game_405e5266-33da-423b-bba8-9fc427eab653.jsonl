This means there cannot be any other bomb adjacent to (4,2). The squares adjacent to (4,2) are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3). Since (4,3) is flagged, none of these other squares can be bombs.\n\n2. **Look for forced moves:**\n   - The number '2' at (5,5) has only one adjacent flag at (4,5). Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (5,5). The adjacent squares are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), and (6,6). Since (4,5) is already flagged, the bomb must be at one of the other unexplored squares: (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), or (6,6). However, (5,4) is adjacent to the number '1' at (5,5), and since there is already a flag at (4,5), (5,4) cannot be a bomb. Similarly, (6,4) is adjacent to the number '1' at (6,5) and cannot be a bomb. This leaves (4,4), (4,6), (5,6), and (6,6) as possible bomb locations.\n\n3. **Determine the safest move:**\n   - Since (4,4), (4,6), (5,6), and (6,6) are all potential bomb locations, it is safer to reveal a square that is not adjacent to any number that requires a bomb. For example, (6,6) is adjacent to the number '2' at (5,5) and the number '2' at (6,5), so it is a potential bomb location. Instead, we can reveal (6,7), which is unexplored and not adjacent to any numbers that require a bomb.\n\n### EXPLANATION:\nThe safest move is to reveal (6,7) because it is unexplored and not adjacent to any numbers that require a bomb, minimizing the risk of hitting a bomb.\n\n### MOVE:\n6,7,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n2 _ 1 1 1 . . . . . .\n3 _ 1 . 1 1 1 . . . .\n4 _ 1 1 F _ 1 1 . . .\n5 _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 . . .\n7 1 2 1 1 1 . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 8, "y": 1, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "### Step 1: Check all revealed numbers against existing flags\n\nFirst, I'll scan the board to see if any revealed numbers are already satisfied by adjacent flags. For example, if a '1' has one adjacent flag, then all other adjacent squares must be safe.\n\n### Step 2: Look for obvious conflicts\n\nNext, I'll check for any conflicts where a number has more adjacent flags than it should. For instance, if a '1' has two adjacent flags, that's a conflict.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\n\nThere are 10 bombs on the board and 9 flags remaining. This means there's one bomb that hasn't been flagged yet.\n\n### Step 4: Decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile\n\nBased on the above analysis, I'll look for squares that must be bombs or must be safe.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n1. **Position (4,3)**: This is flagged as a bomb ('F'). Let's verify if this is correct.\n   - Adjacent to (4,3) are positions (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4).\n   - Looking at (3,3): It shows '1'. Since (4,3) is flagged, there should be no other bombs adjacent to (3,3).\n   - Looking at (4,2): It shows '1'. Since (4,3) is flagged, there should be no other bombs adjacent to (4,2).\n   - Looking at (5,3): It shows '1'. Since (4,3) is flagged, there should be no other bombs adjacent to (5,3).\n   - This seems consistent.\n\n2. **Position (7,1)**: It shows '2'. Let's see how many adjacent flags it has.\n   - Adjacent to (7,1) are positions (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2).\n   - There are no adjacent flags. So, there must be two bombs adjacent to (7,1).\n\n3. **Position (7,6)**: It shows '2'. Let's see how many adjacent flags it has.\n   - Adjacent to (7,6) are positions (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7).\n   - There are no adjacent flags. So, there must be two bombs adjacent to (7,6).\n\n4. **Position (5,5)**: It shows '2'. Let's see how many adjacent flags it has.\n   - Adjacent to (5,5) are positions (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n   - There are no adjacent flags. So, there must be two bombs adjacent to (5,5).\n\n5. **Position (6,6)**: It shows '2'. Let's see how many adjacent flags it has.\n   - Adjacent to (6,6) are positions (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n   - There are no adjacent flags. So, there must be two bombs adjacent to (6,6).\n\n6. **Position (7,7)**: It shows '1'. Let's see how many adjacent flags it has.\n   - Adjacent to (7,7) are positions (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8).\n   - There are no adjacent flags. So, there must be one bomb adjacent to (7,7).\n\n7. **Position (7,9)**: It shows '1'. Let's see how many adjacent flags it has.\n   - Adjacent to (7,9) are positions (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9).\n   - There are no adjacent flags. So, there must be one bomb adjacent to (7,9).\n\n### Potential Moves:\n\n1. **Position (8,1)**: Adjacent to (7,1) which shows '2'. Since there are no adjacent flags, and we need two bombs, this could be a bomb.\n   - However, we need to confirm if placing a flag here would conflict with other numbers.\n\n2. **Position (8,6)**: Adjacent to (7,6) which shows '2'. Since there are no adjacent flags, and we need two bombs, this could be a bomb.\n   - Similarly, we need to confirm if placing a flag here would conflict with other numbers.\n\n3. **Position (6,5)**: Adjacent to (5,5) which shows '2'. Since there are no adjacent flags, and we need two bombs, this could be a bomb.\n   - We need to confirm if placing a flag here would conflict with other numbers.\n\n4. **Position (6,7)**: Adjacent to (6,6) which shows '2'. Since there are no adjacent flags, and we need two bombs, this could be a bomb.\n   - We need to confirm if placing a flag here would conflict with other numbers.\n\n5. **Position (8,7)**: Adjacent to (7,7) which shows '1'. Since there are no adjacent flags, and we need one bomb, this could be a bomb.\n   - We need to confirm if placing a flag here would conflict with other numbers.\n\n6. **Position (8,9)**: Adjacent to (7,9) which shows '1'. Since there are no adjacent flags, and we need one bomb, this could be a bomb.\n   - We need to confirm if placing a flag here would conflict with other numbers.\n\n### Decision:\n\nAfter analyzing the potential moves, I notice that **position (8,1)** is adjacent to (7,1) which shows '2'. Since there are no adjacent flags, and we need two bombs, placing a flag here would help satisfy the '2' at (7,1). Additionally, this move doesn't conflict with any other numbers on the board.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Placing a flag at (8,1) satisfies the '2' at (7,1) and doesn't conflict with any other numbers on the board.\n\n**MOVE:** 8,1,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . 1 _\n1 _ _ _ 1 . . 2 1 1 _\n2 _ 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ 1 . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _\n4 _ 1 1 F _ 1 1 1 _ _\n5 _ _ _ _ 1 2 . 1 _ _\n6 _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 1 _ _\n7 1 2 1 1 1 . 2 1 2 1\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

The board is a 10x10 grid with some squares revealed, some unexplored (marked with '.'), and some flagged (marked with 'F'). The numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that square.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Key Areas\n\nI notice several areas with numbers that might help determine where bombs are:\n\n- At (0,3): '1' \u2013 indicating one bomb in the adjacent squares.\n- At (1,6): '2' \u2013 indicating two bombs adjacent.\n- At (2,1): '1' \u2013 indicating one bomb nearby.\n- At (3,1): '1' \u2013 indicating one bomb nearby.\n- At (4,1): '1' \u2013 indicating one bomb nearby.\n- And so on for other numbered squares.\n\n### Step 3: Checking Existing Flags\n\nThere are currently three flags placed on the board:\n\n- At (4,2): 'F'\n- At (6,1): 'F'\n- At (8,1): 'F'\n\nI need to verify if these flags are correctly placed based on the adjacent numbers.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing Specific Squares\n\nLet's start with the flagged square at (4,2):\n\n- Adjacent squares to (4,2) are: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n- Looking at (3,1): '1' \u2013 one bomb adjacent.\n- (3,2): '.' \u2013 unexplored.\n- (3,3): '1' \u2013 one bomb adjacent.\n- (4,1): '1' \u2013 one bomb adjacent.\n- (4,3): 'F' \u2013 but there's no flag here; it's a '.'.\n  \nWait, there seems to be a confusion here. Let's correct that.\n\nWait, (4,3) is 'F'? Looking back at the board:\n\n```\n4 _ 1 1 F _ 1 1 1 _ _\n```\n\nYes, (4,3) is 'F'. So, adjacent to (4,2), we have (3,1): '1', (3,2): '.', (3,3): '1', (4,1): '1', (4,3): 'F', (5,1): '.', (5,2): '.', (5,3): '.'.\n\nSince (4,3) is flagged, it's considered a bomb for adjacent squares.\n\nSo, (3,1): '1' \u2013 adjacent bombs: (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nWait, let's re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at (3,1): '1'.\n\nAdjacent squares to (3,1): (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n```\n2 _ 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ 1 . 1 1 1 1 _ _ _\n4 _ 1 1 F _ 1 1 1 _ _\n```\n\nSo, (3,1): '1' \u2013 adjacent squares:\n\n- (2,0): '_'\n- (2,1): '1'\n- (2,2): '1'\n- (3,0): '_'\n- (3,2): '.'\n- (4,0): '_'\n- (4,1): '1'\n- (4,2): '1'\n\nNow, '1' means there's exactly one bomb adjacent.\n\nLooking at these squares:\n\n- (2,0): '_' \u2013 revealed, safe.\n- (2,1): '1' \u2013 number, not a bomb.\n- (2,2): '1' \u2013 number, not a bomb.\n- (3,0): '_' \u2013 revealed, safe.\n- (3,2): '.' \u2013 unexplored.\n- (4,0): '_' \u2013 revealed, safe.\n- (4,1): '1' \u2013 number, not a bomb.\n- (4,2): '1' \u2013 number, not a bomb.\n\nSo, the only possible bomb adjacent to (3,1) is at (3,2).\n\nTherefore, (3,2) must be a bomb.\n\n### Step 5: Placing a Flag\n\nBased on the above analysis, I should place a flag at (3,2).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The square at (3,1) shows '1', and the only adjacent unexplored square is (3,2).

So, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (7,1).\n\n   - Adjacent cells to (7,1): (7,0), (7,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n   \n   - Flag at (6,1) covers one bomb.

So, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (7,1).\n\n   - Adjacent cells to (7,1): (7,0), (7,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n   \n   - Flag at (8,1) covers one bomb. Therefore, one more bomb is adjacent to (7,1).\n\n   - **Cell (7,0):** '.' \u2014 unexplored; potential bomb.\n\n   - **Cell (7,2):** '1' \u2014 already shows '1', so it cannot have a bomb.\n\n   - **Cell (6,0):** '.' \u2014 unexplored; potential bomb.\n\n   - **Cell (6,2):** '.' \u2014 unexplored; potential bomb.\n\n   - **Cell (8,0):** '.' \u2014 unexplored; potential bomb.\n\n   - **Cell (8,2):** '.' \u2014 unexplored; potential bomb.\n\n   **Conclusion:** No direct conflict, but need to identify where the second bomb adjacent to (7,1) is.\n\n### **Step 3: Considering the Remaining Number of Flags vs Bombs**\n\n**Flags Remaining:** 3\n\n**Bombs:** 10\n\n**Flags Placed:** 4 (at (3,2), (4,3), (6,1), (8,1))\n\nWait a minute, the initial info says \"Flags remaining: 3\", but I see 4 flags on the board. There might be a discrepancy here.\n\nUpon re-examining the board, I see the following flags:\n\n- **Row 3:** (3,2)\n- **Row 4:** (4,3)\n- **Row 6:** (6,1)\n- **Row 8:** (8,1)\n\nThat's 4 flags, but the game info says only 3 flags are remaining, implying a total of 3 flags. This suggests that there might be an error in the initial info or in my count.\n\nAssuming that the \"Flags remaining: 3\" is accurate, and considering that the board shows 4 flags, it's possible that one of the flags is incorrectly placed or that the initial information is incorrect.\n\nFor the sake of proceeding, I'll assume that there are indeed 3 flags remaining, meaning that the total flags placed are 7 (10 bombs - 3 remaining). However, only 4 flags are visible on the board. This inconsistency suggests that some flags may have been removed or there's a miscommunication in the provided data.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I'll proceed by focusing on the visible flags and ensuring that they are correctly placed according to the numbers.\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying Safe Moves**\n\nGiven the potential flag count discrepancy, I'll prioritize revealing safe cells rather than placing new flags.\n\n#### **Safe Cells Based on Existing Flags:**\n\n1. **Cell (3,0):** Adjacent to (3,1) which shows '1' and has a flag at (3,2). Therefore, (3,0) must be safe.\n\n2. **Cell (4,0):** Adjacent to (4,1) which shows '1' and has a flag at (4,3). Therefore, (4,0) must be safe.\n\n3. **Cell (5,1):** Adjacent to (4,1) which shows '1' and has a flag at (4,3). Therefore, (5,1) must be safe.\n\n4. **Cell (5,2):** Adjacent to (4,2) which shows '1' and has a flag at (4,3). Therefore, (5,2) must be safe.\n\n5. **Cell (5,3):** Adjacent to (4,3) which is flagged. Therefore, (5,3) must be safe.\n\n6. **Cell (6,0):** Adjacent to (6,1) which is flagged and (7,1) which shows '2'. Since one bomb is already flagged at (6,1), there must be one more bomb adjacent to (7,1). However, (6,0) is adjacent to (7,1) and could be the second bomb. Therefore, it's not definitively safe.\n\n7. **Cell (7,0):** Adjacent to (7,1) which shows '2' and has a flag at (6,1). Therefore, one more bomb is adjacent to (7,1), and (7,0) is a potential candidate. It's not safe.\n\n8. **Cell (8,0):** Adjacent to (8,1) which is flagged and (7,1) which shows '2'. Since one bomb is already flagged at (8,1), there must be one more bomb adjacent to (7,1). (8,0) is a potential candidate. It's not safe.\n\n9. **Cell (8,2):** Adjacent to (8,1) which is flagged and (7,1) which shows '2'. Since one bomb is already flagged at (8,1), there must be one more bomb adjacent to (7,1). (8,2) is a potential candidate. It's not safe.\n\n#### **Conclusion on Safe Cells:**\n\nThe safe cells that I can confidently reveal are:\n\n- (3,0)\n\n- (4,0)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (5,3)\n\nAmong these, I'll choose the one that seems most likely to provide new information.\n\n### **Step 5: Deciding the Next Move**\n\nRevealing cell (5,1) could potentially open up more information in that area, as it's adjacent to multiple unexplored cells.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Revealing cell (5,1) is safe because it's adjacent to cell (4,1) which shows '1' and has a flag at (4,3), ensuring that (5,1) cannot be a bomb. Revealing this cell may provide new numbers that can help in identifying more bombs or safe cells.\n\n**MOVE:** 5,1,false", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . 1 _\n1 _ _ _ 1 . . 2 1 1 _\n2 _ 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ 1 F 1 1 1 1 _ _ _\n4 _ 1 1 F _ 1 1 1 _ _\n5 _ _ _ _ F 2 . 1 _ _\n6 _ F _ _ F . 2 1 _ _\n7 F 2 1 1 1 . 2 1 2 1\n8 .

Let's verify the flags on the board:\n     - (3,2): Flag\n     - (4,2): Flag\n     - (6,1): Flag\n     - (6,4): Flag\n   - So, there are 4 flags placed, but only 3 flags remaining. This indicates a conflict.\n\n4. **Identify the conflict:**\n   - The game indicates 3 flags remaining, but 4 flags are placed on the board. This suggests that one of the flags is incorrect.\n\n5. **Resolve the conflict:**\n   - Check the flags:\n     - (3,2): The '1' at (3,3) already has this flag, so no additional bombs adjacent.\n     - (4,2): The '1' at (4,3) already has this flag, so no additional bombs adjacent.\n     - (6,1): Check adjacent numbers:\n       - (5,1): Unexplored\n       - (5,0): Unexplored\n       - (6,0): Unexplored\n       - (7,0): Flag\n       - (7,1): '2' with a flag at (7,0). Needs one more bomb adjacent: (6,1) or (7,2).\n       - (7,2): '1' with no adjacent flags. Possible bomb at (6,1) or (7,2).\n       - Since (6,1) is flagged, (7,2) must be safe.\n     - (6,4): Check adjacent numbers:\n       - (5,4): Flag\n       - (5,3): Unexplored\n       - (5,5): '2' with a flag at (5,4).

Adjacent squares include (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n   - Since (5,5) is `2` and (5,7) is `1`, and (6,7) is `1`, the bombs must be among (5,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\n   **Potential Flag:** If we can determine that one of these squares is a bomb, we can flag it.\n\n2. **Position (7,1) has a `2`:**\n   - Adjacent squares include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0) [flagged], (7,2), (8,0), (8,1) [flagged], (8,2).\n   - Since (7,0) and (8,1) are flagged, there's one more bomb among (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (8,0), (8,2).\n\n   **Potential Flag:** If we can determine that one of these squares is a bomb, we can flag it.\n\n### **Deciding the Next Move**\n\nGiven the analysis, the safest immediate move is to reveal a square that we are confident is safe. Revealing (3,0) is a good choice because it's adjacent to (3,1), which only has one adjacent bomb (flagged at (3,2)), making (3,0) safe.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Position (3,0) is adjacent to (3,1), which already has a flagged bomb at (3,2).

The adjacent tile (2,2) shows '1', and the only adjacent flag is at (3,2). This is consistent.\n   - At (4,3), there\u2019s a flag (F). The adjacent tile (4,2) shows '1', and the only adjacent flag is at (4,3). This is also consistent.\n   - At (5,4), there\u2019s a flag (F). The adjacent tile (5,5) shows '2', and there\u2019s only one adjacent flag at (5,4). This means there must be another bomb adjacent to (5,5).\n   - At (6,4) and (6,5), there are flags (F). The adjacent tile (6,7) shows '2', and there are two adjacent flags at (6,4) and (6,5). This is consistent.\n\n2. **Potential Bombs**:\n   - At (5,5), it shows '2', and there\u2019s only one adjacent flag at (5,4). Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (5,5). The only unexplored adjacent tile is (4,4).\n   - At (7,0), there\u2019s a flag (F). The adjacent tile (7,1) shows '2', and there\u2019s only one adjacent flag at (7,0). Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (7,1). The unexplored adjacent tiles are (6,0) and (6,1).\n   - At (8,1), there\u2019s a flag (F). The adjacent tile (7,1) shows '2', and there\u2019s only one adjacent flag at (8,1). Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (7,1). The unexplored adjacent tiles are (6,0) and (6,1).\n\n3. **Safe Moves**:\n   - At (0,3), it shows '1', and there\u2019s one adjacent flag at (0,8). Therefore, all other adjacent tiles are safe. The unexplored adjacent tile is (0,4).\n   - At (1,6), it shows '2', and there\u2019s one adjacent flag at (1,8). Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (1,6). The unexplored adjacent tiles are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (2,5), (2,6), and (2,7). However, (0,8) is already flagged, so (0,7) is safe.\n\n### CONCLUSION:\nThe safest move is to reveal (0,4), as it is guaranteed to be safe based on the numbers and flags.\n\nEXPLANATION: The number '1' at (0,3) with one adjacent flag at (0,8) means the adjacent tile at (0,4) is safe to reveal.\nMOVE: 0,4,false", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . 1 _\n1 _ _ _ 1 . . 2 1 1 _\n2 _ 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ 1 F 1 1 1 1 _ _ _\n4 _ 1 1 F _ 1 1 1 _ _\n5 _ _ _ _ F 2 . 1 _ _\n6 _ _ _ _ F F 2 1 _ _\n7 F 2 1 1 1 . 2 1 2 1\n8 .
