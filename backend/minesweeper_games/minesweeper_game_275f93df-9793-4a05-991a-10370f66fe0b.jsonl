{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nLet's analyze the current state of the game.\n\nThe board is completely unexplored (all positions are '.'), and we have 10 flags remaining to mark 10 bombs. The board size is 10x10.\n\nSince we have no revealed squares yet, we don't have any information about where the bombs might be. In Minesweeper, the best strategy for the very first move is to click on a random square, preferably near the center of the board. The first move is always a bit of a gamble.\n\nCentrally located squares are often strategically better for the first move because they give you more information about the surrounding area compared to corner or edge squares. If we reveal a square in the center, we'll get information about 8 adjacent squares (assuming it's not a bomb).\n\nSo I'll choose a square near the center of the board, such as (4,4) or (5,5).\n\nLet's go with (4,4) for our first move.\n\nThe move format should be:\nx,y,flag\n\nWhere:\n- x is the ROW (vertical position)\n- y is the COLUMN (horizontal position)\n- flag is true/false (true to place a flag, false to reveal a tile)\n\nSince we want to reveal a tile at position (4,4), our move would be:\n4,4,false\n</think>\n# Minesweeper First Move Analysis\n\n## Current Situation\n- We have a completely unexplored 10x10 board\n- There are 10 bombs total\n- No information is available yet about bomb locations\n\n## Strategy for First Move\nThe first move in Minesweeper is always a calculated risk. Statistically, the best approach is to click near the center of the board rather than at the edges or corners. This is because:\n\n1. A center position gives maximum information (potential to reveal 8 adjacent cells)\n2. Corner positions only provide information about 3 adjacent cells\n3. Edge positions only provide information about 5 adjacent cells\n4. The probability of hitting a bomb on the first click is relatively low (10/100 = 10%)\n\n## Decision\nI'll select a position near the center of the board for maximum information gain.\n\nEXPLANATION: Making first move near the center of the board to maximize information gain from the first revealed square.\nMOVE: 4,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
