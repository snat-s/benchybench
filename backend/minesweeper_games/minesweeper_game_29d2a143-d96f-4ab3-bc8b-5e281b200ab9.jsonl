{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nI'm playing Minesweeper on a 10x10 board with 10 bombs. I need to analyze the current board state and make my next move.\n\nLooking at the current board state, I see that it's completely unexplored - every position is marked with \".\". This means I'm at the very beginning of the game. \n\nIn this situation, there's no information to work with yet. I need to make my first move, which should be to reveal a square. Since there's no information to go on, any square is equally likely to contain a bomb. The probability of hitting a bomb is 10/100 = 0.1 or 10%.\n\nStrategy-wise, a common approach in Minesweeper is to start in the middle of the board rather than at the edges or corners. This is because revealing a square in the middle has a higher chance of creating a larger opening with more revealed numbers, giving more information for subsequent moves. The corners and edges are more constrained and often leave fewer options.\n\nSo, I'll choose a position near the center of the board - let's say (4,4) which is near the center of our 10x10 board.\n\nI need to reveal this square, not flag it, so the flag parameter will be false.\n\nMy move will be: 4,4,false\n</think>\nLooking at the board, I see it's completely unexplored. This is the start of the game, and I need to make my first move.\n\nIn Minesweeper, a good starting strategy is to click in the middle of the board rather than at the edges. This is because a central location has the potential to reveal more information and create larger openings if I'm lucky.\n\nWith 10 bombs on a 10\u00d710 board, there's a 10% chance any given square contains a bomb. Since I have no information yet, I'll select a position near the center of the board.\n\nEXPLANATION: Making my first move in the center of the board to maximize information gain in case I hit an empty area.\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
