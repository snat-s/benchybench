{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "### Step 1: Understanding the Board\nFirst, I looked at the current state of the board. The board is a 10x10 grid with some squares revealed, some unexplored, and one flagged square at position (4,5). There are 10 bombs in total, and 9 flags remain to be placed.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Revealed Numbers and Flags\nI started by examining each revealed number to see if it aligns with the current flags:\n\n- **Position (0,7):** Shows a '1'. The adjacent squares are:\n  - (0,6): Unexplored\n  - (0,8): Revealed as safe\n  - (1,7): Revealed as '1'\n  - (1,6): Unexplored\n  - (1,8): Revealed as '1'\n\nSince (0,7) shows '1', and none of the adjacent squares except (0,6) and (1,6) are unexplored, one of these must be a bomb.\n\n- **Position (1,7):** Also shows a '1'. Adjacent squares:\n  - (0,7): '1'\n  - (0,6): Unexplored\n  - (0,8): Revealed\n  - (1,6): Unexplored\n  - (1,8): '1'\n  - (2,7): Unexplored\n  - (2,6): Unexplored\n  - (2,8): Revealed\n\nGiven that (1,7) is '1', and considering (0,7) is already '1', it's likely that one of (0,6) or (1,6) is a bomb.\n\n### Step 3: Checking for Conflicts\nLooking at position (1,7), if we assume (0,6) is a bomb, then (1,6) should be safe. Similarly, if (1,6) is a bomb, then (0,6) is safe. There's no immediate conflict, but we need to verify further.\n\n### Step 4: Examining Other Numbers\n- **Position (3,3):** Shows a '3'. Adjacent squares:\n  - (2,2): Revealed '1'\n  - (2,3): Revealed '1'\n  - (2,4): Revealed '1'\n  - (3,2): Revealed '2'\n  - (3,4): Revealed '.'\n  - (4,2): Revealed '.'\n  - (4,3): Revealed '.'\n  - (4,4): Revealed '2'\n\nGiven that (3,3) is '3', and adjacent to it are three unexplored squares: (3,4), (4,3), and (4,4). Since (4,5) is flagged, which is adjacent to (4,4), and (4,4) shows '2', this suggests that there might be another bomb adjacent to (4,4).\n\n### Step 5: Deciding the Next Move\nBased on the analysis, I need to decide whether to place a flag or reveal a tile. Given that position (0,6) and (1,6) are potential bomb locations adjacent to (0,7) and (1,7), it's safer to first reveal one of these squares to gather more information.\n\n### Step 6: Choosing the Specific Move\nI'll choose to reveal (0,6) because if it's a bomb, it will be flagged automatically, and if it's safe, it will help in determining the status of adjacent squares.\n\n### Final Decision\n**EXPLANATION:** Position (0,6) is adjacent to (0,7), which shows '1'. Revealing (0,6) will help determine if it's a bomb or safe, aiding in further deductions.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,6,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n2 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _\n3 . 2 2 3 . 1 _ 1 1 1\n4 . . . . 2 F _ 1 . .\n5 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1\n6 . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n7 . . . . . . 2 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 1 1 1\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "### **Understanding the Current Board State**\n\nBefore making any move, it's essential to comprehend the current state of the board. Here's a breakdown:\n\n- **Unexplored Squares (`.`)**:\n  - These are squares that haven't been revealed yet. They could either be safe or contain bombs.\n  \n- **Revealed Empty Squares (`_`)**:\n  - These squares have been revealed and are safe, indicating that they do not contain bombs.\n\n- **Numbered Squares (`1-8`)**:\n  - These indicate the number of bombs in the adjacent eight squares. For example, a `1` means there's one bomb in the neighboring squares.\n\n- **Flagged Squares (`F`)**:\n  - These are squares where the player has marked as containing a bomb.\n\nGiven the board size is 10x10 with a total of 10 bombs and 9 flags remaining, every move must be calculated to optimize the chances of success.\n\n### **Identifying Potential Bombs**\n\nThe first step is to look for squares where bombs are definitively located based on the numbers revealed.\n\n**Example 1: Square (0,8) with value `1`**\n- Adjacent squares: (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)\n- Square (0,9) is already revealed as `.`, meaning it's unexplored.\n- Square (1,8) is flagged (`F`), indicating a bomb.\n  - Since (0,8) shows `1` and there's already one bomb flagged at (1,8), there cannot be another bomb in its adjacent squares.\n  - Therefore, squares (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), and (1,9) are safe and can be revealed.\n\n**Example 2: Square (3,8) with value `1`**\n- Adjacent squares: (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9)\n- Square (4,7) is flagged (`F`), indicating a bomb.\n  - Since (3,8) shows `1` and there's already one bomb flagged at (4,7), there cannot be another bomb in its adjacent squares.\n  - Therefore, squares (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,8), and (4,9) are safe and can be revealed.\n\n**Example 3: Square (8,6) with value `2`**\n- Adjacent squares: (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n- There are no flagged squares adjacent to (8,6).\n  - Since it shows `2`, there must be two bombs in the adjacent squares.\n  - Without additional information, it's uncertain which specific squares contain bombs, so we'll need to look for more clues elsewhere.\n\n### **Looking for Safe Squares to Reveal**\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify several squares that are safe to reveal.\n\n**Safe Squares from Example 1:**\n- (0,7)\n- (0,9)\n- (1,7)\n- (1,9)\n\n**Safe Squares from Example 2:**\n- (2,7)\n- (2,8)\n- (2,9)\n- (3,7)\n- (3,9)\n- (4,8)\n- (4,9)\n\nOut of these, let's choose the square that might provide the most information or lead to further deductions.\n\n**Choosing Square (0,7):**\n- Revealing (0,7) might help in determining the status of surrounding squares, especially since it's adjacent to (0,8) which is already a `1`.\n\n### **Potential Flag Placements**\n\nNext, we need to consider where to place flags, ensuring that each flag aligns with the numbers on the board.\n\n**Example 4: Square (4,5) with value `F` (Flagged)**\n- Adjacent squares: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n- Square (4,5) is already flagged, so we need to ensure that the numbers around it are consistent.\n  \n**Example 5: Square (3,1) with value `2`**\n- Adjacent squares: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n- There's a flagged bomb at (4,1).\n  - Since (3,1) shows `2` and there's one bomb flagged at (4,1), there must be one more bomb in its adjacent squares.\n  - Looking at the adjacent unexplored squares: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2)\n  - Without additional information, we cannot definitively place a flag here yet.\n\n**Example 6: Square (6,6) with value `1`**\n- Adjacent squares: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n- There are no flagged squares adjacent to (6,6).\n  - It shows `1`, so there must be one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n  - All adjacent squares are unexplored, so we need more information to place a flag.\n\n### **Considering the Number of Flags Remaining**\n\nThere are 9 flags remaining, and 10 bombs in total. This means we need to place all 9 flags to mark all bombs, leaving one bomb unmarked. However, it's crucial to place flags only where we are certain there's a bomb to avoid conflicts with the numbers on the board.\n\n### **Making the Decision**\n\nGiven the above analysis, the most logical next move is to reveal a safe square that can provide more information about the surrounding area.\n\n**Choosing Square (0,7):**\n- Revealing this square will help confirm the status of its adjacent squares and potentially lead to more deductions.\n\n### **Final Move**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Revealing square (0,7) is safe based on the fact that square (0,8) shows `1` with one bomb already flagged at (1,8). Revealing (0,7) will help determine the status of the surrounding squares, particularly (0,9) and (1,7), aiding in further bomb identification.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,7,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n2 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _\n3 . 2 2 3 . 1 _ 1 1 1\n4 . . . . 2 F _ 1 . .\n5 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1\n6 . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n7 . . . . . . 2 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 1 1 1\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Since the number is `3`, there should be two more bombs adjacent.\n\n### Step 2: Looking for Obvious Conflicts\n\nI need to ensure that no number has more adjacent flags than it should.\n\n**Potential Conflict Check:**\n\n- **Position (4,4)**: Flagged (`F`).\n  - Adjacent positions: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n  - Let's check the numbers around it:\n    - (3,4): `3` (already has one flag at (4,4), needs two more).\n    - (4,5): `1` (no flags adjacent).\n    - (5,4): `1` (no flags adjacent).\n  - No immediate conflicts detected.\n\n### Step 3: Considering Remaining Flags vs. Bombs\n\nThe game info states there are **10 bombs** and **9 flags remaining**. This means there's one bomb that hasn't been flagged yet.\n\n### Step 4: Deciding the Next Move\n\nBased on the analysis, I need to decide whether to place a new flag or reveal a tile.\n\n**Potential Moves:**\n\n1. **Position (2,0)**: Unexplored (`.`).\n   - Adjacent to `1` at (1,0).\n   - Since (1,0) already has a `1` and no adjacent flags, it's unlikely to be a bomb.\n   - **Decision**: Reveal this tile.\n\n2. **Position (4,5)**: Unexplored (`.`).\n   - Adjacent to `F` at (4,4) and `1` at (4,6).\n   - The `1` at (4,6) already has a flag at (4,4), so there are no more bombs adjacent to it.\n   - **Decision**: Reveal this tile.\n\n3. **Position (6,6)**: Unexplored (`.`).\n   - Adjacent to `1` at (6,5) and `1` at (6,7).\n   - Both `1`s don't have adjacent flags, so these tiles could be bombs.\n   - **Decision**: Consider placing a flag here.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nGiven the analysis, the most strategic move is to **reveal position (2,0)**, as it's adjacent to a `1` with no adjacent flags, indicating it's likely safe.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Position (2,0) is adjacent to a revealed `1` at (1,0) with no adjacent flags, suggesting it's safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,0,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1\n2 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _\n3 . 2 2 3 . 1 _ 1 1 1\n4 . . . . 2 F _ 1 . .\n5 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 1 1\n6 . . . . 2 1 1 _ _ _\n7 . . . . . . 2 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 2 1 1 1\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
