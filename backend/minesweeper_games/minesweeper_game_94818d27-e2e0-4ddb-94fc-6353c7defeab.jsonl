Since there must be exactly 2 bombs adjacent to that \"2\" tile, and one is likely already adjacent (probably at position (8,4)), the unexplored position at (9,3) must contain a bomb.

At position (9,3) we already have a flag placed. Looking at the 1 at (9,5), it means there's only one bomb adjacent to it, which must be the already-flagged (9,3) position. This means (9,4) is safe to reveal. The 2 at (8,4) is satisfied by the flag at (9,3) and another bomb that must be either at (7,3), (7,4), or (8,3). However, I can't determine which one with certainty yet. Similarly, I need more information in other areas.
