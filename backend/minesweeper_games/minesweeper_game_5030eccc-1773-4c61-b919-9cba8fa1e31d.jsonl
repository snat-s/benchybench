This is a conflict because a '1' should only have one adjacent flag.\n\n- **At (3, 5):** The number '1' has two flags adjacent (one directly to the left and one below). This is a conflict because a '1' should only have one adjacent flag.\n\n- **At (5, 5):** The number '2' has only three flags in the adjacent squares. One flag is below the '2' at (6,5) and two flags are to the right at (5,6) & (5,7). However, these flags are not satisfying the number '2'. It suggests there is one more flag missing below it. Directly below it, there is a flag and its surrounding squares consecutively yield a flag count of 3, but '2' is left out on the top at (4,5). Hence the number '2' suggest an additional flag below it.\n\n### Decision:\n\nGiven the conflicts and the remaining unexplored squares, we need to correct the flag placement and then reveal a safe square.\n\n**Move Explanation:**\nRemove the flag at (5,5) to align with the number '2' adjacent to it and consequently reveal the adjacent square to verify new adjacency criteria.\n\n**Next Move:**\n```\nMOVE: 5,6, false for verification of new adjacency criteria\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nRemoves the current flag to conduct further adjacency count verification.
