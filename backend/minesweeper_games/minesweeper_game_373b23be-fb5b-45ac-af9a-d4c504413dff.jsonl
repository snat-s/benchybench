This means we're starting from scratch, and our first move will be a guess.\n\n### Deciding the First Move\n\nIn Minesweeper, the first move is typically a safe bet if you choose a corner or edge tile, as these have fewer adjacent squares compared to the center tiles, reducing the chance of hitting a bomb.\n\n**Possible First Moves:**\n- Corners: (0,0), (0,9), (9,0), (9,9)\n- Edges: Any tile along the perimeter\n\nI'll choose the top-left corner, position (0,0), for the first move.\n\n### Making the Move\n\n**Move:** Reveal tile at (0,0)\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\nUpon revealing (0,0), one of the following will happen:\n1. **Bomb:** Game over.\n2. **Empty:** The tile will be marked as '_' or show a number indicating adjacent bombs.\n3. **Number:** If there are bombs adjacent to (0,0), it will display a number (1-8).\n\nSince we don't have any information yet, we proceed with the reveal.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Selecting the First Tile:**\n   - Choosing a corner tile minimizes the number of adjacent tiles, reducing the risk of immediate bomb exposure.\n\n2. **Revealing the Tile:**\n   - Clicking on (0,0) will update the board with either a bomb, an empty space, or a number.\n\n3. **Interpreting the Result:**\n   - **If it's a bomb:** Unfortunately, the game ends.\n   - **If it's empty or shows a number:** We gain valuable information about adjacent tiles.\n\n4. **Planning the Next Move:**\n   - Based on the result, we can determine safe moves or flag potential bombs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince we're beginning the game and have no prior information, selecting a corner tile for the first move is a standard and safe strategy.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Starting with a corner tile minimizes the number of adjacent squares, reducing the risk of hitting a bomb on the first move.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Placing a flag here aligns with the game's rules and helps us proceed safely.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,1,true\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nEXPLANATION: By analyzing the numbers at (0,0) and (0,1), and considering the constraints they impose on their adjacent squares, we deduce that (1,1) must be a bomb.
