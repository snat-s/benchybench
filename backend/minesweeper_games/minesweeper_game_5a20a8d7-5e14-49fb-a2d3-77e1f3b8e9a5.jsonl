Since the '1' is satisfied by the flag, (0,0) must be safe.\n  \n- **Tile (1,0):** Adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,0). (0,1) has a '1' and a flagged bomb at (1,2), so (1,0) is safe.\n  \n- **Tile (2,0):** Adjacent to (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), and (3,0). (2,1) has a '1' with no adjacent flags, so one bomb is adjacent. However, since (1,1) is safe (being adjacent to '1' with a flag), (2,0) could be a bomb. Let's hold off on this.\n\n- **Tile (3,0):** Adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), and (4,0). (2,1) has a '1' with no adjacent flags, so one bomb is adjacent. Since (2,0) is unexplored, we can't be sure about (3,0).\n\nLooking at tile (0,0) and (1,0), both are safe to reveal.\n\n### Deciding the Next Move\n\nGiven the analysis, the safest move is to reveal tile (0,0). This tile is adjacent to a '1' which already has an adjacent flag, so it cannot be a bomb.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (0,0) is adjacent to a '1' at (0,1), which has an adjacent flag at (1,2).

Therefore, we should remove the flag at `(1,1)`.\n\n### Step 5: Determining the Next Move\nBased on the conflict identified, the logical next move is to remove the incorrect flag at `(1,1)`.\n\n**Move:**\n```\nEXPLANATION: The flag at (1,1) conflicts with the number '1' displayed on the tile, indicating it's incorrectly placed.

This is consistent.\n\n### **Step 2: Resolving Identified Conflicts**\n\nFrom the analysis above, the main conflicts are in Rows 0 and 2, where cells show '1' but have two adjacent flags. This suggests that at least one of these flags is incorrectly placed.\n\n#### **Analyzing Row 0 Conflicts:**\n- **Cell (0,1):** Shows '1', but has two adjacent flags at (1,1) and (1,2).\n  \n  **Possible Solutions:**\n  1. **Remove one of the flags:** Since '1' can only have one adjacent bomb, one of these flags must be incorrect.\n  \n  **Decision:** I need to determine which flag is correctly placed.\n\n#### **Analyzing Row 2 Conflicts:**\n- **Cells (2,1), (2,2), (2,3):** Each shows '1' but has two adjacent flags at (1,1) and (1,2).\n  \n  **Possible Solutions:**\n  1. **Remove one of the flags:** Similar to Row 0, only one flag should be adjacent to these cells.\n  \n  **Decision:** Again, I need to determine which flag is correctly placed.\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Correct Flag Placement**\n\nTo resolve these conflicts, I need to determine which flag among (1,1) and (1,2) is correctly placed.\n\n#### **Examining Flag at (1,1):**\n- **Adjacent numbers:**\n  - (0,0): '1' \u2013 already has one flag at (1,1).\n  - (0,1): '1' \u2013 has flags at (1,1) and (1,2).\n  - (1,0): '.'\n  - (2,0): '.'\n  - (2,1): '1'\n  - (2,2): '1'\n  \n  If (1,1) is a bomb:\n  - It satisfies the '1' at (0,0).\n  - It causes conflicts at (0,1), (2,1), and (2,2) because they show '1' but would have two adjacent flags.\n\n#### **Examining Flag at (1,2):**\n- **Adjacent numbers:**\n  - (0,1): '1' \u2013 has flags at (1,1) and (1,2).\n  - (1,1): 'F'\n  - (1,3): '.'\n  - (2,1): '1'\n  - (2,2): '1'\n  - (2,3): '1'\n  \n  If (1,2) is a bomb:\n  - It causes conflicts at (0,1), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) because they show '1' but would have two adjacent flags.\n\n**Conclusion:** Both flags at (1,1) and (1,2) seem to cause conflicts when considered individually. This suggests that only one of them should be a bomb, and the other flag is incorrect.\n\n### **Step 4: Deciding Which Flag to Remove**\n\nTo decide which flag to remove, I need to see if there's any additional information that can help determine the correct bomb placement.\n\n#### **Looking at Cell (3,4):** Shows '2'\n- Adjacent cells: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n- Flagged cells: (2,4), (3,5) are flagged ('F')\n  \n  '2' indicates two bombs adjacent, and there are two flags. This is consistent, so both flags at (2,4) and (3,5) are likely correct.\n\n#### **Looking at Cell (4,5):** Shows '1'\n- Adjacent cells: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n- Flagged cells: (3,5) is flagged ('F')\n  \n  '1' indicates one bomb adjacent, and there's one flag. This is consistent.\n\nGiven that the flags at (2,4) and (3,5) are consistent with the numbers, I can focus on resolving the conflicts in Rows 0 and 2.\n\n#### **Re-examining Row 0:**\n- **Cell (0,1):** Shows '1' with flags at (1,1) and (1,2).\n  \n  Since only one of these flags can be correct, I need to determine which one.\n\n#### **Re-examining Row 2:**\n- **Cells (2,1), (2,2), (2,3):** Each shows '1' with flags at (1,1) and (1,2).\n  \n  Similarly, only one of these flags can be correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Finding Additional Clues to Resolve the Conflict**\n\nTo further determine which flag is correct, I'll look at other cells that might be influenced by these flags.\n\n#### **Looking at Cell (1,0):** Unexplored '.'\n- Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)\n  \n  **Inference:**\n  - (0,0): '1' \u2013 already has one flag at (1,1).\n  - (0,1): '1' \u2013 has flags at (1,1) and (1,2).\n  - (2,0): '.'\n  \n  If (1,1) is a bomb:\n  - (0,0) has one bomb adjacent, which is satisfied.\n  - (0,1) has two bombs adjacent, which is a conflict.\n  \n  If (1,2) is a bomb:\n  - (0,1) has one bomb adjacent, which is satisfied if (1,1) is not a bomb.\n  \n  Therefore, it's more consistent if (1,1) is not a bomb and (1,2) is the bomb.\n\n**Decision:** Remove the flag at (1,1) and keep the flag at (1,2).\n\n### **Step 6: Executing the Move**\n\nBased on the above analysis, the next move should be to remove the flag at (1,1).\n\n```\nEXPLANATION: The flag at (1,1) is causing conflicts with multiple '1' cells in Rows 0 and 2. Removing this flag resolves the inconsistency and aligns with the numbers displayed on the board.\nMOVE: 1,1,true\n```\n\n**Note:** The flag parameter is set to `true` to indicate the removal of an existing flag. However, typically, to remove a flag, the flag parameter should be set to `false` or a separate command is used to toggle the flag. Assuming that `flag=true` is used to remove the flag, the move is correctly specified.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n```\nEXPLANATION: The flag at (1,1) causes conflicts with multiple '1' cells in Rows 0 and 2.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "### **Understanding the Board**\n\nFirst, I'll take a moment to understand the current state of the board. The Minesweeper grid is 10x10, meaning there are 10 rows and 10 columns. The coordinates are zero-indexed, so the top-left corner is (0,0), and the bottom-right corner is (9,9).\n\n### **Interpreting the Symbols**\n\nLet's decode the symbols on the board:\n\n- **Numbers (1, 2):** These indicate how many bombs are adjacent to that particular square. For example, a '1' means there's exactly one bomb in the surrounding eight squares.\n  \n- **Underscore (_):** This represents an empty revealed space, meaning it's safe and has been clicked or revealed.\n  \n- **Period (.):** This denotes an unexplored space. It could be safe or could contain a bomb.\n  \n- **'F':** This signifies a flagged space, where the player suspects a bomb is present.\n  \n- **'*':** If present, this would indicate a revealed bomb, resulting in a game over.\n\n### **Analyzing the Board Layout**\n\nLet's go through each row to identify patterns or clues:\n\n- **Row 0:** `1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _`\n  - The first two squares are '1's, indicating that each has exactly one bomb in the adjacent squares.\n  \n- **Row 1:** `. 1 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _`\n  - The second square is '1' with an adjacent flag ('F') at (1,2). Since '1' indicates exactly one bomb, and there's already a flag adjacent to it, the other adjacent squares must be safe.\n  \n- **Row 2:** `. 1 1 1 F _ _ _ _ _`\n  - Multiple '1's here. The flag at (2,4) is adjacent to the '1' at (2,3). Similar to the previous row, since '1' has exactly one bomb, and there's already a flag, the other adjacent squares are safe.\n  \n- **Row 3:** `. . . . 2 F _ _ _ _`\n  - The '2' at (3,4) has a flag at (3,5). '2' means there are exactly two bombs adjacent. Since one is already flagged at (3,5), there must be another bomb adjacent to (3,4).\n  \n- **Row 4:** `. . . . . 1 _ _ _ _`\n  - The '1' at (4,5) indicates exactly one bomb adjacent to it.\n  \n- **Row 5:** `. . . . 2 1 _ _ _ _`\n  - The '2' at (5,4) and '1' at (5,5) need careful examination.\n  \n- **Row 6:** `. . . . 2 1 _ _ _ _`\n  - Similar to Row 5.\n  \n- **Row 7:** `. . . . . 2 1 _ _ _`\n  - The '2' at (7,5) and '1' at (7,6).\n  \n- **Row 8:** `. . . . . . 1 _ 1 1`\n  - Multiple '1's in this row.\n  \n- **Row 9:** `. . . . . . 1 _ 1 .`\n  - The '1's here could help in identifying safe squares or bombs.\n\n### **Flagging Mechanics**\n\nThere are **7 flags remaining**, and **10 bombs** on the board. This means that 3 flags have already been placed. Since flags represent suspected bombs, it's crucial to ensure that each flag is correctly placed based on the numbers revealed.\n\n### **Identifying Safe Moves**\n\nLet's look for squares that can safely be revealed without the risk of hitting a bomb.\n\n#### **Examining Row 1:**\n\nAt (1,1), there's a '1' with an adjacent flag at (1,2). Since '1' indicates exactly one bomb, and there's already a flag adjacent to it, the other adjacent squares must be safe. The adjacent squares to (1,1) are:\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n- (1,0), (1,2)\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (1,2) is flagged ('F').\n- (0,0) is '1'.\n- (0,1) is '1'.\n  \nSince both (0,0) and (0,1) are '1's, and each has exactly one bomb adjacent, and we've already flagged (1,2), the other adjacent squares to (1,1) must be safe.\n\nLooking at (2,0), it's currently unexplored ('.'). Since (1,1) is '1' and has an adjacent flag at (1,2), (2,0) can't be a bomb. Therefore, it's safe to reveal.\n\n#### **Examining Row 3:**\n\nAt (3,4), there's a '2' with a flag at (3,5). '2' means exactly two bombs adjacent. Since one is already flagged at (3,5), there must be another bomb adjacent to (3,4).\n\nThe adjacent squares to (3,4) are:\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n- (3,3), (3,5)\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (3,5) is flagged ('F').\n  \nSo, one bomb is at (3,5). There must be another bomb in the remaining adjacent squares. Let's look at them:\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n  - (2,4) is flagged ('F'), so it's already counted.\n  \nWait, but (2,4) is flagged, which is adjacent to (3,4). So, both bombs adjacent to (3,4) are already flagged at (3,5) and (2,4). That satisfies the '2' at (3,4).\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check:\n\nAdjacent to (3,4):\n\n- (2,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (2,4): flagged ('F')\n- (2,5): unexplored ('.')\n- (3,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (3,5): flagged ('F')\n- (4,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (4,4): unexplored ('.')\n- (4,5): '1'\n\nSince '2' at (3,4) has two flags adjacent at (2,4) and (3,5), the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nTherefore, squares (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (4,3), and (4,4) are safe to reveal.\n\n#### **Examining Row 4:**\n\nAt (4,5), there's a '1'. We need to determine where the bomb adjacent to it could be.\n\nAdjacent squares to (4,5):\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n- (4,4), (4,6)\n- (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (3,5) is flagged ('F').\n  \nSo, the bomb adjacent to (4,5) is already flagged at (3,5). Therefore, the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nLooking at (4,4), it's unexplored ('.'). Since (4,5) is '1' and has an adjacent flag at (3,5), (4,4) can't be a bomb. Therefore, it's safe to reveal.\n\n#### **Examining Row 5:**\n\nAt (5,4), there's a '2'. We need to identify where the two bombs adjacent to it could be.\n\nAdjacent squares to (5,4):\n\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n- (5,3), (5,5)\n- (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (4,5) is '1'.\n  \nLooking at (4,5) being '1', and its adjacent squares:\n\nAdjacent to (4,5):\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n- (4,4), (4,6)\n- (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (3,5) is flagged ('F').\n  \nSo, (3,5) is the bomb adjacent to (4,5). Therefore, the other adjacent squares to (4,5) are safe.\n\nLooking back at (5,4), which is '2', and its adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (4,4): unexplored ('.')\n- (4,5): '1'\n- (5,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (5,5): '1'\n- (6,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (6,4): unexplored ('.')\n- (6,5): unexplored ('.')\n\nSince (4,5) is '1' and has an adjacent flag at (3,5), the other adjacent squares to (4,5) are safe.\n\nTherefore, (4,4) is safe, and similarly, (5,5) is '1', which needs further analysis.\n\n#### **Examining Row 6:**\n\nAt (6,4), there's a '2'. We need to identify where the two bombs adjacent to it could be.\n\nAdjacent squares to (6,4):\n\n- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n- (6,3), (6,5)\n- (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (5,4) is '2'.\n  \nLooking at (5,4), which is '2', and its adjacent squares:\n\nAdjacent to (5,4):\n\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n- (5,3), (5,5)\n- (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (4,5) is '1' with an adjacent flag at (3,5).\n  \nSo, the bomb adjacent to (4,5) is at (3,5), satisfying its '1'. Therefore, the other adjacent squares to (4,5) are safe.\n\nLooking back at (6,4), which is '2', and its adjacent squares:\n\n- (5,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (5,4): '2'\n- (5,5): '1'\n- (6,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (6,5): unexplored ('.')\n- (7,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (7,4): unexplored ('.')\n- (7,5): '2'\n\nSince (5,4) is '2', and (5,5) is '1', which has an adjacent flag at (3,5), the other adjacent squares to (5,5) are safe.\n\nTherefore, squares (5,3), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), and (7,4) are safe to reveal.\n\n#### **Examining Row 7:**\n\nAt (7,5), there's a '2'. We need to identify where the two bombs adjacent to it could be.\n\nAdjacent squares to (7,5):\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n- (7,4), (7,6)\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (6,5) is unexplored ('.').\n  \nLooking at (6,5), it's adjacent to (7,5), which is '2'. We need to determine if (6,5) is a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is unexplored ('.').\n\nTo determine if (6,5) is a bomb, let's look at (6,4), which is '2'.\n\nAdjacent to (6,4):\n\n- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n- (6,3), (6,5)\n- (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (5,4) is '2'.\n  \nLooking at (5,4), which is '2', and its adjacent squares:\n\nAdjacent to (5,4):\n\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n- (5,3), (5,5)\n- (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (4,5) is '1' with an adjacent flag at (3,5).\n  \nSo, the bomb adjacent to (4,5) is at (3,5), satisfying its '1'. Therefore, the other adjacent squares to (4,5) are safe.\n\nLooking back at (5,4), which is '2', and its adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (4,4): unexplored ('.')\n- (4,5): '1'\n- (5,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (5,5): '1'\n- (6,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (6,4): '2'\n- (6,5): unexplored ('.')\n\nSince (5,5) is '1' and has an adjacent flag at (3,5), the other adjacent squares to (5,5) are safe.\n\nTherefore, squares (5,3), (6,3), and (6,5) are safe to reveal.\n\n#### **Examining Row 8:**\n\nAt (8,6), there's a '1'. We need to determine where the bomb adjacent to it could be.\n\nAdjacent squares to (8,6):\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n- (8,5), (8,7)\n- (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (7,5) is '2'.\n  \nLooking at (7,5), which is '2', and its adjacent squares:\n\nAdjacent to (7,5):\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n- (7,4), (7,6)\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (6,5) is unexplored ('.').\n  \nSince (7,5) is '2', and we've identified that (6,5) is safe to reveal, we need to find the two bombs adjacent to (7,5).\n\nPossible bombs adjacent to (7,5):\n\n- (6,4): '2', but it's a number, not a bomb.\n- (6,5): unexplored.\n- (6,6): unexplored.\n- (7,4): unexplored.\n- (7,6): unexplored.\n- (8,4): unexplored.\n- (8,5): unexplored.\n- (8,6): '1'.\n\nGiven that (8,6) is '1', and it's adjacent to (7,5), which is '2', we can deduce that one bomb adjacent to (7,5) is at (8,6).\n\nWait, but (8,6) is '1', meaning it has exactly one bomb adjacent to it. Since (7,5) is '2', and one bomb is at (8,6), there must be another bomb adjacent to (7,5).\n\nLooking at the adjacent squares to (7,5):\n\n- (6,4): '2'\n- (6,5): unexplored.\n- (6,6): unexplored.\n- (7,4): unexplored.\n- (7,6): unexplored.\n- (8,4): unexplored.\n- (8,5): unexplored.\n- (8,6): '1'.\n\nSince (8,6) is '1', and it's adjacent to (7,5), which is '2', one bomb is at (8,6). Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (7,5) in the remaining squares: (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), or (8,4), (8,5).\n\nBut we've already deduced that (6,5) is safe to reveal, so it's not a bomb. Therefore, the other bomb must be among (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), or (8,5).\n\nThis is getting complex, so perhaps it's better to look for safer moves elsewhere.\n\n#### **Examining Row 9:**\n\nAt (9,6), there's a '1'. We need to determine where the bomb adjacent to it could be.\n\nAdjacent squares to (9,6):\n\n- (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)\n- (9,5), (9,7)\n- (10,5), (10,6), (10,7)\n\nWait, our board size is 10x10, so rows go from 0 to 9 and columns from 0 to 9. Therefore, (10,5) etc., are invalid coordinates. So, the valid adjacent squares are:\n\n- (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)\n- (9,5), (9,7)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (8,6) is '1'.\n  \nLooking at (8,6), which is '1', and its adjacent squares:\n\nAdjacent to (8,6):\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n- (8,5), (8,7)\n- (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (7,5) is '2'.\n  \nGiven that (9,6) is '1', and it's adjacent to (8,6), which is '1', we can deduce that the bomb adjacent to (9,6) is at (8,6).\n\nWait, but (8,6) is '1', meaning it has exactly one bomb adjacent to it. Since (9,6) is '1', and it's adjacent to (8,6), the bomb adjacent to (9,6) must be at (8,6).\n\nHowever, (8,6) itself is '1', indicating that it has exactly one bomb adjacent to it, not that it itself is a bomb. So, there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, let's re-examine:\n\nAt (9,6), there's a '1'. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)\n- (9,5), (9,7)\n\nWe need to determine where the bomb adjacent to (9,6) is.\n\nLooking at (8,6), which is '1', and its adjacent squares:\n\nAdjacent to (8,6):\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n- (8,5), (8,7)\n- (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\nGiven that (9,6) is '1', and it's adjacent to (8,6), which is '1', we can deduce that the bomb adjacent to (9,6) is at (8,6).\n\nBut (8,6) is '1', meaning it has exactly one bomb adjacent to it, not that it itself is a bomb. Therefore, the bomb adjacent to (9,6) cannot be at (8,6), because (8,6) is just indicating that there's one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nThis suggests that there might be an inconsistency in our earlier deductions. Let's revisit our analysis.\n\n#### **Re-evaluating Row 3:**\n\nEarlier, we concluded that at (3,4), which is '2', there are two bombs adjacent, already flagged at (3,5) and (2,4). Therefore, the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nBut let's double-check:\n\nAdjacent to (3,4):\n\n- (2,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (2,4): flagged ('F')\n- (2,5): unexplored ('.')\n- (3,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (3,5): flagged ('F')\n- (4,3): unexplored ('.')\n- (4,4): unexplored ('.')\n- (4,5): '1'\n\nSince '2' at (3,4) has two flags adjacent at (2,4) and (3,5), the other adjacent squares are indeed safe.\n\nTherefore, squares (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (4,3), and (4,4) are safe to reveal.\n\n#### **Re-examining Row 7:**\n\nAt (7,5), there's a '2'. We need to identify where the two bombs adjacent to it could be.\n\nAdjacent squares to (7,5):\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n- (7,4), (7,6)\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nWe know:\n\n- (6,5) is unexplored ('.').\n  \nFrom earlier analysis, we determined that (6,5) is safe to reveal. Therefore, the two bombs adjacent to (7,5) must be among (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), or (8,6).\n\nBut (6,4) is '2', which is a number, not a bomb. So, possible bombs are at (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), or (8,6).\n\nLooking at (8,6), which is '1', and it's adjacent to (7,5). If (8,6) were a bomb, that would satisfy one bomb adjacent to (7,5). Then, there must be another bomb adjacent to (7,5) among (6,6), (7,4), or (7,6).\n\nBut to be safe, let's look for a square that can be revealed without risk.\n\n#### **Identifying the Safest Move**\n\nAfter reviewing the board, the safest move seems to be revealing square (2,0) in Row 1. Here's why:\n\n- At (1,1), there's a '1' with an adjacent flag at (1,2).\n- Therefore, the other adjacent squares to (1,1) must be safe.\n- (2,0) is adjacent to (1,1) and currently unexplored.\n- Revealing (2,0) poses no risk of hitting a bomb.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the above analysis, the safest and most logical move is to reveal the square at (2,0).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The square at (2,0) is adjacent to a '1' at (1,1) which already has an adjacent flag at (1,2). Therefore, (2,0) cannot be a bomb and is safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,0,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . 1 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 . 1 1 1 F _ _ _ _ _\n3 . . . . 2 F _ _ _ _\n4 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . . . . 2 1 _ _ _ _\n6 . . . . 2 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 1 _ 1 1\n9 . . . . . . 1 _ 1 .", "sucess": true}

Since it's '1', there must be exactly one bomb adjacent. Currently, none are flagged, so we need to investigate further.\n\n- **Tile (0,1):** Displays '1'. Adjacent tiles are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2).\n  - (0,0): '1' (number)\n  - (0,2): '_' (empty)\n  - (1,0): '.'

Since the tile displays '1', and there's already one flag, there should be no other bombs adjacent.\n\n- **Tile (1,1):** Displays '1'.

Adjacent tiles are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3).\n  \n  Let's check if this flag is correctly placed by looking at adjacent numbered tiles.\n\n  - **Tile (0,1):** '1' \u2013 Has one adjacent flag at (1,2), which is correct.\n  - **Tile (1,1):** '1' \u2013 Has one adjacent flag at (1,2), which is correct.\n  - **Tile (2,1):** '1' \u2013 Let's check its adjacent tiles.\n  \n  - **Tile (2,1):** Displays '1'.

Since the tile displays '1', there should be no other bombs adjacent.\n\n- **Tile (2,2):** Displays '1'. Adjacent tiles are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3).\n  - (1,1): '1' (number)\n  - (1,2): 'F' (flagged)\n  - (1,3): 'F' (flagged)\n  - (2,1): '1' (number)\n  - (2,3): '1' (number)\n  - (3,1): '_' (empty)\n  - (3,2): '1' (number)\n  - (3,3): '.' (unexplored)\n\n  Two adjacent flags at (1,2) and (1,3). However, the tile displays '1', which means there should only be one bomb adjacent. This indicates a conflict.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Conflicts**\n\nFrom the analysis above, there's a conflict at tile (2,2):\n\n- **Tile (2,2):** Displays '1' but has two adjacent flags at (1,2) and (1,3). This violates the rule that a '1' tile should have exactly one adjacent bomb.\n\nThis suggests that at least one of these flags is incorrectly placed.\n\n**Step 3: Resolving the Conflict**\n\nLet's examine the flags at (1,2) and (1,3):\n\n- **Flag at (1,2):** Adjacent to tiles (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1).\n  - **Tile (0,1):** '1' \u2013 Correctly satisfied by this flag.\n  - **Tile (1,1):** '1' \u2013 Correctly satisfied by this flag.\n  - **Tile (2,1):** '1' \u2013 Correctly satisfied by this flag.\n\n  This flag seems correctly placed.\n\n- **Flag at (1,3):** Adjacent to tiles (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4).\n  - **Tile (0,2):** '_' (empty)\n  - **Tile (0,3):** '_' (empty)\n  - **Tile (0,4):** '_' (empty)\n  - **Tile (1,2):** 'F' (flagged)\n  - **Tile (1,4):** '_' (empty)\n  - **Tile (2,2):** '1' (number)\n  - **Tile (2,3):** '1' (number)\n  - **Tile (2,4):** 'F' (flagged)\n\n  Let's check the numbered tiles adjacent to (1,3):\n\n  - **Tile (2,2):** '1' \u2013 Has two adjacent flags at (1,2) and (1,3), which is a conflict.\n  - **Tile (2,3):** '1' \u2013 Adjacent tiles are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), and (3,4).\n    - (1,2): 'F' (flagged)\n    - (1,3): 'F' (flagged)\n    - (1,4): '_' (empty)\n    - (2,2): '1' (number)\n    - (2,4): 'F' (flagged)\n    - (3,2): '1' (number)\n    - (3,3): '.' (unexplored)\n    - (3,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\n    One adjacent flag at (1,2) (since (1,3) and (2,4) are also flagged, but we need to confirm). Wait, tile (2,3) displays '1' and has flags at (1,2) and (2,4). This is another conflict because it should only have one adjacent bomb.\n\nThis indicates that the flag at (1,3) is causing conflicts with both tile (2,2) and tile (2,3). Therefore, it's likely that the flag at (1,3) is incorrectly placed.\n\n**Step 4: Deciding the Next Move**\n\nGiven the conflicts identified, the best course of action is to remove the flag at (1,3) to resolve the inconsistencies.\n\n**Move: (1,3) - Remove Flag**\n\n### **Verifying the Move**\n\nAfter removing the flag at (1,3):\n\n- **Tile (2,2):** Now has one adjacent flag at (1,2), which aligns with its '1' value.\n- **Tile (2,3):** Now has one adjacent flag at (1,2), which aligns with its '1' value.\n\nThis resolves the previous conflicts.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy removing the flag at (1,3), we've resolved the conflicts in the adjacent numbered tiles, ensuring that the number of adjacent flags matches the displayed numbers. This move helps maintain the integrity of the board and brings us closer to successfully completing the Minesweeper game.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```\nEXPLANATION: Removed the flag at (1,3) to resolve conflicts with adjacent numbered tiles, ensuring the number of adjacent flags matches the displayed numbers.\nMOVE: 1,3,false\n```", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . 1 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 1 1 1 1 F _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 . 2 F _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 . . 1 _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 1 . 2 1 _ _ _ _\n6 1 1 2 . 2 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 1 _ 1 1\n9 . . . . . . 1 _ 1 .", "sucess": true}

This satisfies the condition for '1'.\n   - At (1,1): The number is '1' with one adjacent flag at (1,2). This also satisfies the condition for '1'.\n   - At (2,2): The number is '1' with one adjacent flag at (2,4). This satisfies the condition for '1'.\n   - At (3,3): The number is '1' with no adjacent flags. This suggests there is exactly one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles.\n   - At (3,4): The number is '2' with one adjacent flag at (2,4). This suggests there is one more bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles.\n   - At (4,2): The number is '2' with no adjacent flags. This suggests there are two bombs in the adjacent unexplored tiles.\n   - At (5,2): The number is '1' with no adjacent flags. This suggests there is one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles.\n   - At (6,2): The number is '2' with no adjacent flags. This suggests there are two bombs in the adjacent unexplored tiles.\n   - At (6,4): The number is '2' with no adjacent flags. This suggests there are two bombs in the adjacent unexplored tiles.\n   - At (7,5): The number is '2' with no adjacent flags. This suggests there are two bombs in the adjacent unexplored tiles.\n   - At (8,6): The number is '1' with no adjacent flags. This suggests there is one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles.\n   - At (8,8): The number is '1' with no adjacent flags. This suggests there is one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles.\n   - At (9,6): The number is '1' with no adjacent flags. This suggests there is one bomb in the adjacent unexplored tiles.\n\n2. **Looking for Obvious Conflicts:**\n   - No obvious conflicts are present in the current state.\n\n3. **Considering Remaining Flags vs Bombs:**\n   - There are 7 flags remaining and 10 bombs. This means we need to place 3 more flags.\n\n4. **Deciding the Move:**\n   - Let's focus on (3,3): The number is '1' with no adjacent flags. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Since (2,4) is already flagged, the bomb must be in one of the remaining adjacent tiles.\n   - Looking at (4,3): It is unexplored and adjacent to (3,3). Given the number '1' at (3,3) and the flag at (2,4), it is safe to reveal (4,3).\n\n### EXPLANATION:\nRevealing (4,3) is safe because the number '1' at (3,3) already has one adjacent flag at (2,4), so there cannot be another bomb in the adjacent tiles. Therefore, (4,3) is safe to reveal.\n\n### MOVE:\n4,3,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . 1 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 1 1 1 1 F _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 . 2 F _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 . . 1 _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 1 . 2 1 _ _ _ _\n6 1 1 2 . 2 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 1 _ 1 1\n9 . . . . . . 1 _ 1 .", "sucess": true}

This means there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to (2,4). The unexplored adjacent tiles are (1,3), (1,4), (3,3), and (3,5).  \n   - At (3,5), there is a '2' with one adjacent flag (at (2,5)). This means there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to (3,5). The unexplored adjacent tiles are (2,4), (3,4), and (4,5).  \n   - At (4,3), there is a '3' with no adjacent flags. This means there must be exactly three bombs adjacent to (4,3). The unexplored adjacent tiles are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), and (5,4).  \n\n2. **Obvious Moves**:  \n   - At (1,3), the tile is unexplored and adjacent to (2,4)'s '2'. Since (2,4) already has one adjacent flag at (2,5), there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to (2,4). The only unexplored adjacent tiles are (1,3), (1,4), (3,3), and (3,5).  \n   - At (1,4), the tile is unexplored and adjacent to (2,4)'s '2'. This is another candidate for the second bomb adjacent to (2,4).  \n\n3. **Flag Placement**:  \n   - Given the constraints, we can deduce that either (1,3) or (1,4) must be a bomb. However, we need more information to decide which one.  \n\n4. **Revealing Safe Tiles**:  \n   - At (3,3), the tile is unexplored and adjacent to (4,3)'s '3'. Since (4,3) requires three bombs in its adjacent tiles, and there are no flags yet, this tile could be safe to reveal.  \n\n**Decision**:  \nTo proceed safely, we will reveal the tile at (3,3) to gather more information.  \n\nMOVE: 3,3,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 . 1 F _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 1 1 1 1 F _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 . 2 F _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ 2 3 . 1 _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ 1 . 2 1 _ _ _ _\n6 1 1 2 . 2 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n8 . . . . . . 1 _ 1 1\n9 . . . . . . 1 _ 1 .", "sucess": false}
