**Adjacent to (7,1) which shows '1' and (8,1) which shows '1'.**\n   - **Analysis:**\n     - Both (7,1) and (8,1) have their bomb count satisfied by the flagged tile at (8,0).\n     - **Conclusion:** Tile (7,2) is safe to reveal.\n\n2. **Tile (8,2):**\n   - **Adjacent to (8,1) which shows '1' and (8,3) which shows '2'.**\n   - **Analysis:**\n     - (8,1) has its bomb count satisfied by the flagged tile at (8,0).\n     - (8,3) needs one more bomb adjacent, but (8,2) is already considered.\n     - **Conclusion:** Tile (8,2) is safe to reveal.\n\n3. **Tile (7,4):**\n   - **Adjacent to (7,3) which shows '2' and (8,3) which shows '2'.**\n   - **Analysis:**\n     - (7,3) already has one bomb flagged at (6,3), needing one more.\n     - (8,3) already has one bomb flagged at (9,2), needing one more.\n     - However, without additional information, it's safer to assume that (7,4) might be a bomb.\n     - **Conclusion:** It's safer to avoid revealing (7,4) without further information.\n\n4. **Tile (6,6):**\n   - **Adjacent to (5,6) which shows '3' and (6,5) which shows '3'.**\n   - **Analysis:**\n     - Both (5,6) and (6,5) require multiple bombs adjacent.\n     - Without flags adjacent to these tiles, it's uncertain whether (6,6) is safe.\n     - **Conclusion:** It's safer to avoid revealing (6,6) without further information.\n\n#### **Potential Bombs: Flagging Likely Bomb Locations**\n\n1. **Tile (6,3):** Already flagged.\n2. **Tile (8,0):** Already flagged.\n3. **Tile (9,2):** Already flagged.\n   \nBased on the analysis, here are additional potential bomb locations:\n\n4. **Tile (7,4):**\n   - **Adjacent to (7,3) which shows '2' and (8,3) which shows '2'.**\n   - **Conclusion:** Likely a bomb, as it satisfies the remaining bomb count for both tiles.\n\n5. **Tile (4,6):**\n   - **Adjacent to (3,6) which shows '2' and (5,6) which shows '3'.**\n   - **Conclusion:** Likely a bomb, as it would help satisfy the bomb count for these tiles.\n\n6. **Tile (5,6):**\n   - **Adjacent to (5,5) which shows '2' and (5,6) which shows '3'.**\n   - **Conclusion:** Likely a bomb, as it would help satisfy the bomb count for these tiles.\n\n7. **Tile (6,5):**\n   - **Adjacent to (6,4) which shows '2' and (6,5) which shows '3'.**\n   - **Conclusion:** Likely a bomb, as it would help satisfy the bomb count for these tiles.\n\n### **Deciding the Next Move**\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the **safest move** appears to be **revealing Tile (7,2)**. Here's why:\n\n- **Tile (7,2)** is adjacent to (7,1) and (8,1), both of which have their bomb counts satisfied by the flagged tile at (8,0).\n- Revealing this tile doesn't risk hitting a bomb and can provide more information about the surrounding area.\n\n**Alternative Consideration:** Flagging **Tile (7,4)** as a potential bomb.\n\nHowever, since we have **7 flags remaining** and only **3 have been used**, it's prudent to **first reveal a safe tile** to gather more information before committing to flagging additional tiles.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (7,2) is safe to reveal because the adjacent numbered tiles (7,1) and (8,1) already have their bomb counts satisfied by the flagged tile at (8,0).\n\n**MOVE:** 7,2,false\n\nThis move will help uncover more of the board safely and provide additional information to make informed decisions in subsequent steps.", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ 1 . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 1 2 2 2 . .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 2 3 . . .\n6 _ _ _ F 2 3 . . . .\n7 1 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n8 F 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n9 . 1 F 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Adjacent tiles: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n    - (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2) are unexplored.\n\n25. **Tile (8,3):** Shows `2`\n    - Adjacent tiles: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n    - (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) are unexplored.\n\n26. **Tile (9,1):** Shows `1`\n    - Adjacent tiles: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2)\n    - (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2) are unexplored.\n\n27. **Tile (9,3):** Shows `F` (Flagged)\n    - (9,3) is flagged, so it's assumed to be a bomb.\n\n**Step 2: Checking Flagged Tiles Against Numbers**\n\nWe have three flagged tiles: (6,4), (8,0), and (9,3). Let's see if these flags make sense with the adjacent numbers.\n\n1. **Flag at (6,4):**\n   - Adjacent tiles: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)\n   - Relevant numbered tiles:\n     - (5,5): `2`\n     - (6,5): `2`\n     - (7,3): `2`\n   - For (5,5): Number `2` with one adjacent flag at (6,4). So there must be one more bomb adjacent to (5,5).\n   - For (6,5): Number `2` with one adjacent flag at (6,4). So there must be one more bomb adjacent to (6,5).\n   - For (7,3): Number `2` with one adjacent flag at (6,4). So there must be one more bomb adjacent to (7,3).\n\n2. **Flag at (8,0):**\n   - Adjacent tiles: (7,0), (7,1), (8,1)\n   - Relevant numbered tiles:\n     - (7,0): `1`\n     - (7,1): `1`\n     - (8,1): `1`\n   - For (7,0): Number `1` with one adjacent flag at (8,0). So there are no other bombs adjacent to (7,0).\n   - For (7,1): Number `1` with one adjacent flag at (8,0). So there are no other bombs adjacent to (7,1).\n   - For (8,1): Number `1` with one adjacent flag at (8,0). So there are no other bombs adjacent to (8,1).\n\n3. **Flag at (9,3):**\n   - Adjacent tiles: (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4)\n   - Relevant numbered tiles:\n     - (8,3): `2`\n     - (9,1): `1`\n   - For (8,3): Number `2` with one adjacent flag at (9,3). So there must be one more bomb adjacent to (8,3).\n   - For (9,1): Number `1` with one adjacent flag at (9,3). So there are no other bombs adjacent to (9,1).\n\n**Step 3: Identifying Safe Moves**\n\nNow, let's look for tiles that can be safely revealed based on the current information.\n\n1. **Tile (7,0):** Number `1` with one adjacent flag at (8,0).\n   - Adjacent unexplored tiles: (6,0), (6,1), (7,1)\n   - Since there's already one flag at (8,0), there are no other bombs adjacent to (7,0).\n   - Therefore, (6,0), (6,1), and (7,1) are safe to reveal.\n\n2. **Tile (7,1):** Number `1` with one adjacent flag at (8,0).\n   - Adjacent unexplored tiles: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n   - Since (8,0) is flagged, there are no other bombs adjacent to (7,1).\n   - Therefore, (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,1), and (8,2) are safe to reveal.\n\n3. **Tile (8,1):** Number `1` with one adjacent flag at (8,0).\n   - Adjacent unexplored tiles: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n   - Since (8,0) is flagged, there are no other bombs adjacent to (8,1).\n   - Therefore, (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), and (9,2) are safe to reveal.\n\n4. **Tile (9,1):** Number `1` with one adjacent flag at (9,3).\n   - Adjacent unexplored tiles: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2)\n   - Since (9,3) is flagged, there are no other bombs adjacent to (9,1).\n   - Therefore, (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), and (9,2) are safe to reveal.\n\n**Step 4: Deciding the Next Move**\n\nBased on the above analysis, the safest moves are to reveal tiles that are adjacent to numbered tiles where the number of adjacent flags equals the number on the tile, indicating that all other adjacent tiles are safe.\n\nLet's choose **Tile (7,1)** to reveal, as it's adjacent to a `1` with a flagged tile at (8,0), ensuring that (7,1) is safe.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nTile (7,1) is adjacent to tile (8,0), which is flagged. Since tile (7,1) shows `1`, and there's already one adjacent flag, there are no other bombs around (7,1).

Since (9,3) shows '1', and there's already a flag adjacent, there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (9,3).\n\n### Step 4: Resolving Potential Bomb Locations\n\nFrom the analysis above, several unexplored tiles are potential bomb locations. I'll try to deduce their status based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\n#### Tile (2,4)\n\nMultiple tiles ((1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)) indicate that (2,4) could be a bomb. Since multiple '1's require a bomb here, it's highly likely that (2,4) is a bomb.\n\n**Decision:** Flag (2,4)\n\n#### Tile (0,8) and (1,8)\n\nTile (0,7) shows '1' and has two possible bomb locations: (0,8) and (1,8). Similarly, (1,7) shows '1' with possible bombs at (0,8), (1,8), and (2,8). Since there are multiple '1's pointing to these tiles, it's likely one of them is a bomb.\n\n**Decision:** Flag (0,8)\n\n#### Tile (3,2)\n\nTile (3,3) shows '1' with possible bomb at (3,2). Since no other tiles are indicating it as a bomb, I'll hold off flagging it until more information is available.\n\n#### Tile (4,4) and (4,6)\n\nTile (4,5) shows '1' with possible bombs at (4,4) and (4,6). Tile (5,5) shows '2' with a flag at (6,4), needing one more bomb at (4,4) or (4,6). This suggests that one of these is a bomb.\n\n**Decision:** Flag (4,6)\n\n#### Tile (5,7)\n\nTile (5,6) shows '3' with possible bombs at (4,6), (4,7), (5,7), and (6,7). Since (4,6) is already flagged, there should be two more bombs here.\n\n**Decision:** Flag (5,7)\n\n#### Tile (7,4)\n\nTile (7,3) shows '2' with two flags already, so no more bombs here.\n\n**Decision:** Safe to reveal\n\n#### Tile (8,4)\n\nTile (8,3) shows '2' with one flag at (9,2), needing one more bomb at (7,4) or (8,4). Since (7,4) was determined safe, (8,4) must be the bomb.\n\n**Decision:** Flag (8,4)\n\n### Step 5: Finalizing the Next Move\n\nBased on the deductions:\n\n1. **Tile (2,4):** Highly likely to be a bomb due to multiple '1's indicating it.\n2. **Tile (0,8):** One of the two possible bombs adjacent to (0,7) and (1,7).\n3. **Tile (4,6):** One of the two possible bombs adjacent to (4,5) and (5,5).\n4. **Tile (5,7):** Required to satisfy the '3' at (5,6).\n5. **Tile (8,4):** Required to satisfy the '2' at (8,3).\n\nAfter placing these flags, I'll have used 5 out of the remaining 7 flags, leaving 2 flags for other potential bombs. However, to proceed cautiously, I'll start by flagging the most certain bomb.\n\n**Most Certain Bomb:** (2,4)\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (2,4) is indicated as a bomb by multiple adjacent '1's, making it a highly probable bomb location. Flagging it will help in further deducing the positions of remaining bombs.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,4,true", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 . 1 _ 1 . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 1 2 2 2 . .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 2 3 . . .\n6 _ _ _ F 2 3 . . . .\n7 1 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n8 F 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n9 . 1 F 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Based on the surrounding numbers, **Tile (2,6)** is more likely to be incorrect because Tile (3,6) has a value of '2' and already has two adjacent flags at (2,6) and (3,5), which would exceed its count.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Consider the remaining flags and bombs**\n- There are **3 flags remaining** and **10 bombs** in total. So far, 7 flags have been placed, meaning 3 bombs are still unflagged.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Decide the next move**\n- **Remove the flag at (2,6)** because it conflicts with the number at (2,3). This will allow us to reveal the tile and gather more information.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Move**\nEXPLANATION: Remove the flag at (2,6) because it conflicts with the number '1' at (2,3).

According to the game info, there are only **3 flags remaining**, but I\u2019ve listed 6 flagged positions. This discrepancy suggests that some flags might have been placed incorrectly or perhaps the initial count was miscommunicated.\n\nHowever, since the game info specifies **3 flags remaining**, and there are **10 bombs**, it's likely that only **3 flags** have been placed so far. Let's reassess:\n\nUpon closer inspection, the flagged positions are:\n- **Position (2,4):** Flagged (`F`).\n- **Position (2,6):** Flagged (`F`).\n- **Position (5,3):** Flagged (`F`).\n\nThis aligns with the **3 flags remaining** as per the game info.\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying Flag Consistency with Numbers**\n\nNow, let's ensure that each flagged position correctly corresponds to a bomb based on the adjacent numbers.\n\n**Flagged Position (2,4):**\n- Adjacent to:\n  - (1,3): `1`\n  - (1,4): `1`\n  - (1,5): `1`\n  - (2,3): `1`\n  - (2,5): `1`\n  - (3,3): `1`\n  - (3,4): `1`\n  - (3,5): `2`\n\nSince (2,4) is flagged as a bomb, we should verify that all adjacent numbered tiles correctly account for this bomb.\n\n**Flagged Position (2,6):**\n- Adjacent to:\n  - (1,5): `1`\n  - (1,6): `_`\n  - (1,7): `1`\n  - (2,5): `1`\n  - (2,7): `1`\n  - (3,5): `2`\n  - (3,6): `2`\n  - (3,7): `2`\n\n**Flagged Position (5,3):**\n- Adjacent to:\n  - (4,2): `_`\n  - (4,3): `_`\n  - (4,4): `_`\n  - (5,2): `_`\n  - (5,4): `_`\n  - (6,2): `_`\n  - (6,3): `F`\n  - (6,4): `2`\n\nLet's check the numbers around these flagged positions to ensure consistency.\n\n**Position (2,6) - Flagged:**\n- Adjacent to `(1,5): 1`, `(1,7): 1`, `(2,5): 1`, `(2,7): 1`, `(3,5): 2`, `(3,6): 2`, `(3,7): 2`.\n  \n  Since (2,6) is flagged as a bomb, the adjacent numbered tiles should account for this bomb.\n\n**Position (5,3) - Flagged:**\n- Adjacent to `(6,4): 2`.\n  \n  The `2` at (6,4) indicates two adjacent bombs. Currently, only (5,3) is flagged adjacent to (6,4), so there must be another bomb adjacent to (6,4).\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Safe Moves**\n\nNext, let's look for squares that can be safely revealed based on the current information.\n\n**Position (6,4):** Shows `2` and has one flagged adjacent bomb at (5,3). Therefore, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (6,4).\n\nAdjacent unexplored positions to (6,4):\n- (5,4): `_`\n- (6,5): `.`\n- (7,4): `.`\n\nSince (5,4) is unexplored (`_`), it's a potential bomb location. However, let's check other areas first.\n\n**Position (3,5):** Shows `2` and has one flagged adjacent bomb at (2,6). Therefore, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (3,5).\n\nAdjacent unexplored positions to (3,5):\n- (2,4): `F` (already flagged)\n- (2,5): `1`\n- (3,4): `1`\n- (3,6): `2`\n- (4,4): `_`\n- (4,5): `1`\n- (4,6): `_`\n\nGiven that (2,4) is already flagged, the remaining bomb must be among the unexplored adjacent positions. However, (4,4) and (4,6) are both unexplored (`_`), so we need more information to determine which one might be the bomb.\n\n**Position (3,6):** Shows `2` and has one flagged adjacent bomb at (2,6). Therefore, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (3,6).\n\nAdjacent unexplored positions to (3,6):\n- (2,5): `1`\n- (2,6): `F` (already flagged)\n- (3,5): `2`\n- (3,7): `2`\n- (4,5): `1`\n- (4,6): `_`\n- (4,7): `_`\n\nHere, (4,6) and (4,7) are unexplored (`_`), so either could be the bomb.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in these positions, let's look for a more straightforward move.\n\n**Position (1,3):** Shows `1` and has one flagged adjacent bomb at (2,4). Therefore, there cannot be any other bombs adjacent to (1,3).\n\nAdjacent unexplored positions to (1,3):\n- (0,2): `_`\n- (0,3): `_`\n- (0,4): `_`\n- (1,2): `_`\n- (1,4): `1`\n- (2,2): `_`\n- (2,3): `1`\n- (2,4): `F` (already flagged)\n\nSince (2,4) is flagged and (1,3) shows `1`, all other adjacent positions must be safe. Therefore, we can safely reveal:\n\n- (0,2)\n- (0,3)\n- (0,4)\n- (1,2)\n- (2,2)\n\nAmong these, let's choose one to reveal.\n\n### **Step 4: Making the Move**\n\nBased on the analysis, revealing `(0,2)` is a safe move since it's adjacent to `(1,3): 1`, which already has one flagged adjacent bomb at `(2,4)`. Therefore, `(0,2)` cannot be a bomb.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** \nThe position `(1,3)` shows `1` and has one flagged adjacent bomb at `(2,4)`. Therefore, all other adjacent positions, including `(0,2)`, cannot contain bombs and are safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,2,false\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically analyzing the revealed numbers and existing flags, we identified that `(0,2)` is a safe position to reveal.

Since there's already a flag at (2,4), and the number is `1`, the remaining adjacent cells are safe to reveal.\n\n   - **Safe Reveal:** (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n2. **Position (2,5):** Similar to (2,3), adjacent cells are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). With a flag at (2,6) and number `1`, the remaining cells are safe.\n\n   - **Safe Reveal:** (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\n3. **Position (3,6):** Number is `2` with a flag at (2,6), so there must be one more bomb adjacent. Adjacent cells are (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). We need to determine where the second bomb is.\n\n   - **Potential Bomb:** Need more information to place a flag here.\n\n4. **Position (5,5):** Number is `2` with a flag at (5,3), so there must be one more bomb adjacent. Adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\n   - **Potential Bomb:** Need more information to place a flag here.\n\n5. **Position (6,4):** Number is `2` with a flag at (6,3), so there must be one more bomb adjacent.

Here's a breakdown of what's visible:\n\n- **Revealed Numbers:** These indicate the number of bombs in the adjacent squares.\n  \n  For example:\n  - At (0,7): `1` \u2014 one bomb nearby.\n  - At (2,5): `1` \u2014 one bomb nearby.\n  - At (3,6): `2` \u2014 two bombs nearby.\n  \n- **Flagged Squares (F):** These are squares believed to contain bombs.\n  \n  Example:\n  - At (2,4): `F` \u2014 flagged bomb.\n  - At (5,3): `F` \u2014 flagged bomb.\n  \n- **Unexplored Squares (`.`):** These are squares that haven't been revealed yet and could either be safe or contain bombs.\n\n### **Step 1: Checking Revealed Numbers Against Existing Flags**\n\nFirst, I need to verify that the existing flags correctly correspond to the numbers on the board.\n\n**Example 1: Square at (1,8) \u2014 Number `1`**\n\n- Adjacent squares: (0,7), (0,8), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8)\n  \n  - (2,7) is already flagged (`F`), which should account for the `1` bomb.\n\n  - Since there's only one bomb indicated by `1`, and one flag already placed at (2,7), there cannot be another bomb in any of the other adjacent squares.\n\n**Example 2: Square at (3,6) \u2014 Number `2`**\n\n- Adjacent squares: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n  \n  - (2,6) is flagged (`F`), accounting for one bomb.\n  \n  - Since the number is `2`, there must be one more bomb among the remaining adjacent squares.\n\n### **Identifying Obvious Conflicts**\n\nNext, I look for any clear conflicts where flags might be incorrectly placed.\n\n**Potential Conflict at (2,4): Flag `F` adjacent to (2,5) \u2014 Number `1`**\n\n- (2,5) indicates there's one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n  \n  - (2,4) is already flagged (`F`), which should be the only bomb here.\n  \n  - Therefore, any other adjacent squares to (2,5) cannot contain bombs.\n\n### **Considering the Remaining Flags vs. Bombs**\n\nThe game indicates there are **10 bombs** in total and **3 flags remaining**.\n\nCounting the existing flags:\n\n- (2,4), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,0), (9,2) \u2014 total of 6 flags placed.\n\nWait, but the game info says only **3 flags remaining**, which implies that the total number of flags that can be placed is 10 (since there are 10 bombs).\n\nThis suggests that 7 flags have already been placed (10 total - 3 remaining). However, counting the existing flags on the board shows only 6 flags. There seems to be a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (2,4): F\n\n- (5,3): F\n\n- (6,3): F\n\n- (7,3): F\n\n- (8,0): F\n\n- (9,2): F\n\nThat's 6 flags. If there are 10 bombs and 3 flags remaining, it implies that 7 flags have been placed (10 - 3). This mismatch suggests that there's an error in the flag count or the initial assumption.\n\nAssuming that the game info is correct, and there are indeed 3 flags remaining out of 10, then 7 flags should already be placed. Therefore, there must be one more flag that isn't visible in the provided board state.\n\nThis discrepancy indicates that I need to ensure all flags are accounted for before proceeding.\n\n### **Step 2: Looking for Potential Flag Placements**\n\nGiven that there's a discrepancy in the flag count, I need to look for squares where placing a flag would be justified based on the numbers.\n\n**Example: Square at (5,5) \u2014 Number `2`**\n\n- Adjacent squares: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n  \n  - Currently, no flags are adjacent to (5,5).\n  \n  - Since the number is `2`, there should be two bombs among these adjacent squares.\n  \n  - Looking at (5,4): unexplored (`.`), could be a bomb.\n  \n  - Looking at (6,5): unexplored (`.`), could be a bomb.\n  \n  - However, without more information, it's risky to place a flag here.\n\n**Example: Square at (6,6) \u2014 Number `3`**\n\n- Adjacent squares: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n  \n  - Currently, no flags are adjacent to (6,6).\n  \n  - The number `3` indicates three bombs nearby.\n  \n  - Potential bomb locations: (5,5), (6,5), (7,5) \u2014 all unexplored.\n  \n  - Placing flags here could be justified, but it's speculative without more data.\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Safe Squares to Reveal**\n\nInstead of placing flags, it might be safer to reveal squares where I'm confident there's no bomb.\n\n**Example: Square at (0,6) \u2014 Unexplored (`.`)**\n\n- Adjacent to (0,7): number `1`.\n  \n  - (0,7) already has one bomb accounted for by the flag at (0,8).\n  \n  - Therefore, (0,6) cannot be a bomb and is safe to reveal.\n\n**Example: Square at (1,3) \u2014 Unexplored (`.`)**\n\n- Adjacent to (1,4): number `1`.\n  \n  - No flags are adjacent to (1,4).\n  \n  - Since the number is `1`, there must be one bomb among the adjacent squares.\n  \n  - If I can determine that none of the other adjacent squares are bombs, (1,3) might be safe.\n\nHowever, without more information, revealing (0,6) seems like a safer bet.\n\n### **Step 4: Making the Move**\n\nBased on the analysis, the safest move appears to be revealing the square at (0,6), as it's adjacent to a number that already has its bomb accounted for by an existing flag.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The square at (0,6) is adjacent to (0,7) which shows a `1`. Since there's already a flag at (0,8) accounting for that bomb, (0,6) cannot be a bomb and is safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,6,false\n\nBy revealing this square, I can gather more information to make informed decisions in subsequent moves.", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 F 1 F 1 . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 1 2 2 2 . .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n5 _ _ _ F _ 2 3 . . .\n6 _ _ _ F 2 3 . . . .\n7 1 1 _ F . . . . . .\n8 F 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n9 . 1 F 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

The board is a 10x10 grid, with the following legend:\n\n- `_` : Empty revealed space\n- `.` : Unexplored space\n- `F` : Flagged space\n- `*` : Revealed bomb (game over)\n- `1-8` : Number indicating adjacent bombs\n\n**Coordinates:**\n- Rows are labeled from `0` to `9` (top to bottom).\n- Columns are labeled from `0` to `9` (left to right).\n\n**Game Info:**\n- **Board size:** 10x10\n- **Flags remaining:** 3\n- **Bombs:** 10\n\n### **Analyzing the Current Board**\n\nLet's examine the board row by row to identify any immediate patterns or areas that need attention.\n\n**Row 0:**\n```\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n```\n- The last revealed number is `1` at position `(0,7)`.\n\n**Row 1:**\n```\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n```\n- Numbers `1` at positions `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`, `(1,5)`, and `(1,7)`.\n\n**Row 2:**\n```\n2 _ _ _ 1 F 1 F 1 . .\n```\n- Numbers `1` at positions `(2,3)` and `(2,5)`.\n- Flags `F` at positions `(2,4)` and `(2,6)`.\n\n**Row 3:**\n```\n3 _ _ _ 1 1 2 2 2 . .\n```\n- Numbers `1` at positions `(3,3)` and `(3,4)`.\n- Number `2` at positions `(3,5)`, `(3,6)`, and `(3,7)`.\n\n**Row 4:**\n```\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n```\n- Number `1` at position `(4,5)`.\n\n**Row 5:**\n```\n5 _ _ _ F _ 2 3 . . .\n```\n- Flag `F` at position `(5,3)`.\n- Numbers `2` at position `(5,6)` and `3` at position `(5,7)`.\n\n**Row 6:**\n```\n6 _ _ _ F 2 3 . . . .\n```\n- Flag `F` at position `(6,3)`.\n- Numbers `2` at position `(6,4)` and `3` at position `(6,5)`.\n\n**Row 7:**\n```\n7 1 1 _ F . . . . . .\n```\n- Numbers `1` at positions `(7,0)` and `(7,1)`.\n- Flag `F` at position `(7,3)`.\n\n**Row 8:**\n```\n8 F 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n```\n- Flag `F` at position `(8,0)`.\n- Number `1` at position `(8,1)` and `2` at position `(8,3)`.\n\n**Row 9:**\n```\n9 . 1 F 1 . . . . . .\n```\n- Number `1` at positions `(9,1)` and `(9,3)`.\n- Flag `F` at position `(9,2)`.\n\n### **Identifying Potential Moves**\n\n**1. Checking for Completed Numbers:**\n\nA number indicates exactly how many bombs are adjacent to it. If a number has the exact number of adjacent flags, all other adjacent tiles can be safely revealed.\n\nLet's look for such instances:\n\n- **Position `(2,3)` with number `1`:**\n  - Adjacent tiles: `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`, `(2,2)`, `(2,4)`, `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`\n  - Flag at `(2,4)`.\n  - Since the number is `1` and there's already one adjacent flag, all other adjacent tiles are safe.\n\n  **Safe tiles to reveal:** `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`, `(2,2)`, `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`\n\n- **Position `(2,5)` with number `1`:**\n  - Adjacent tiles: `(1,4)`, `(1,5)`, `(1,6)`, `(2,4)`, `(2,6)`, `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`, `(3,6)`\n  - Flag at `(2,6)`.\n  - Number is `1` with one adjacent flag, so all other adjacent tiles are safe.\n\n  **Safe tiles to reveal:** `(1,4)`, `(1,5)`, `(1,6)`, `(2,4)`, `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`, `(3,6)`\n\nHowever, many of these tiles are already revealed or flagged. Let's identify which of these tiles are unexplored (` . `).\n\nFrom the above, the following unexplored tiles can be safely revealed:\n\n- `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`, `(2,2)`, `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`, `(1,5)`, `(1,6)`, `(3,5)`, `(3,6)`\n\nBut looking at the board:\n\n- `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`, `(1,5)`, `(2,4)`, `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`, `(3,6)` are either revealed or flagged.\n\nSo, the safe unexplored tiles are: `(1,2)`, `(2,2)`, `(3,2)`, `(1,6)`\n\n**2. Evaluating Flags:**\n\nNext, let's ensure that all placed flags are correctly identifying bombs based on adjacent numbers.\n\nLet's check each flag:\n\n- **Flag at `(2,4)`:** Adjacent to `(2,3)` (number `1`) and `(2,5)` (number `1`).\n  - `(2,3)` has only one adjacent flag (`(2,4)`), which matches its number.\n  - `(2,5)` has one adjacent flag (`(2,6)`), which matches its number.\n  - This flag seems correctly placed.\n\n- **Flag at `(2,6)`:** Adjacent to `(2,5)` (number `1`) and `(3,6)` (number `2`).\n  - `(2,5)` has one adjacent flag (`(2,6)`), which matches its number.\n  - `(3,6)` has number `2`. Adjacent tiles: `(2,5)`, `(2,6)`, `(2,7)`, `(3,5)`, `(3,7)`, `(4,5)`, `(4,6)`, `(4,7)`\n    - Flags: `(2,6)` and `(3,6)` is not flagged.\n    - So, total adjacent flags: `1` (only `(2,6)`).\n    - Number `2` requires two adjacent flags. Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to `(3,6)`.\n\n  **Potential bomb locations adjacent to `(3,6)`:** `(2,5)`, `(2,7)`, `(3,5)`, `(3,7)`, `(4,5)`, `(4,6)`, `(4,7)`\n  \n  - `(2,5)` is already safe (number `1` with flag `(2,6)`).\n  - `(2,7)` is unexplored.\n  - `(3,5)` is already revealed with number `1`.\n  - `(3,7)` is unexplored.\n  - `(4,5)` is revealed with number `1`.\n  - `(4,6)` and `(4,7)` are unexplored.\n\n**3. Assessing Remaining Flags and Bombs:**\n\nWe have **3 flags remaining** and **10 bombs** in total. Looking at the board, let's count how many bombs have been flagged so far.\n\nFlags on the board:\n\n- `(2,4)`, `(2,6)`, `(5,3)`, `(6,3)`, `(7,3)`, `(8,0)`, `(9,2)`.\n\nThat's **7 flags**, but according to the game info, only **3 flags** remain. This suggests that some flags might be incorrectly placed.\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. Let's re-examine the game info:\n\n**Game Info:**\n- **Flags remaining:** 3\n- **Bombs:** 10\n\nIf there are 10 bombs and 3 flags remaining, that means **7 flags have already been placed**.\n\nLooking back at the board, the flags are at:\n\n- `(2,4)`, `(2,6)`, `(5,3)`, `(6,3)`, `(7,3)`, `(8,0)`, `(9,2)`.\n\nSo, **7 flags** have been placed, which aligns with the game info.\n\n**4. Identifying Potential Incorrect Flags:**\n\nSince we have 7 flags placed and 3 remaining, but the game info says only 3 flags remain, there might be a miscalculation. However, based on the board, there are indeed 7 flags placed. Perhaps the game info was misread, or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAssuming the game info is correct and we have 3 flags remaining, meaning only 7 flags have been placed, let's proceed.\n\n**5. Deciding the Next Move:**\n\nGiven that we've identified safe tiles to reveal, our next logical step is to reveal one of these safe tiles to gather more information.\n\nFrom the safe tiles identified earlier: `(1,2)`, `(2,2)`, `(3,2)`, `(1,6)`\n\nLet's choose `(1,2)` to reveal.\n\n**Potential Outcomes:**\n\n- Revealing `(1,2)` might uncover a number, which could help us deduce the locations of more bombs.\n- If `(1,2)` is safe and reveals a number, we can further analyze adjacent tiles.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, the safest move is to reveal tile `(1,2)`.\n\n**EXPLANATION:**  \nThe number `1` at position `(2,3)` already has one adjacent flag at `(2,4)`. Therefore, all other adjacent tiles, including `(1,2)`, are safe to reveal. Revealing `(1,2)` will provide more information to proceed with placing flags or revealing more tiles.\n\n**MOVE:**  \n`1,2,false`  \n*(Reveal tile at row 1, column 2)*", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 F 1 F 1 . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 1 2 2 2 . .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n5 _ _ _ F _ 2 3 . . .\n6 _ _ _ F 2 3 . . . .\n7 1 1 _ F . . . . . .\n8 F 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n9 . 1 F 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

The grid is a 10x10 matrix with various symbols indicating the state of each cell:\n\n- **_ (Underscore)**: An empty revealed space.\n- **.**: An unexplored space.\n- **F**: A flagged space, indicating a suspected bomb.\n- **Numbers (1-8)**: Revealed cells indicating the number of adjacent bombs.\n\n**Flags Remaining:** 3  \n**Total Bombs:** 10\n\nGiven that there are already several flags placed, it's essential to ensure that these flags are correctly positioned based on the revealed numbers. Incorrect flags can lead to contradictions or the risk of stepping on a bomb.\n\n### **Step 1: Reviewing Existing Flags and Numbers**\n\nLet's start by examining the existing flags and the numbers adjacent to them to ensure consistency.\n\n1. **Flag at (2,4):** Adjacent to numbers at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5).\n   - Number at (1,3): 1\n   - Number at (1,4): 1\n   - Number at (1,5): 1\n   - Number at (2,3): 1\n   - Number at (2,5): 1 (Flagged)\n   - Number at (3,3): 1\n   - Number at (3,4): 1\n   - Number at (3,5): 2\n\n   Since the flag at (2,4) is adjacent to multiple '1's, we need to ensure that each '1' has exactly one bomb adjacent to it.\n\n2. **Flag at (2,6):** Adjacent to numbers at (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), and (3,7).\n   - Number at (1,5): 1\n   - Number at (1,6): _ (Empty)\n   - Number at (1,7): 1\n   - Number at (2,5): 1 (Flagged)\n   - Number at (2,7): 1\n   - Number at (3,5): 2\n   - Number at (3,6): 2\n   - Number at (3,7): 2\n\n   The flag at (2,6) affects these numbers, so we need to verify that each '1' and '2' has the correct number of adjacent bombs.\n\n3. **Flag at (5,3):** Adjacent to numbers at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), and (6,4).\n   - Number at (4,2): _\n   - Number at (4,3): _\n   - Number at (4,4): _\n   - Number at (5,2): _\n   - Number at (5,4): 2\n   - Number at (6,2): _\n   - Number at (6,3): 2\n   - Number at (6,4): 3\n\n   This flag impacts these numbers, ensuring that the adjacent '2's and '3' have the correct number of bombs.\n\n4. **Flag at (6,3):** Adjacent to numbers at (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), and (7,4).\n   - Number at (5,2): _\n   - Number at (5,3): F\n   - Number at (5,4): 2\n   - Number at (6,2): _\n   - Number at (6,4): 3\n   - Number at (7,2): _\n   - Number at (7,3): .\n   - Number at (7,4): .\n\n   This flag affects these numbers, so we need to ensure consistency.\n\n5. **Flag at (7,3):** Adjacent to numbers at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), and (8,4).\n   - Number at (6,2): _\n   - Number at (6,3): F\n   - Number at (6,4): 3\n   - Number at (7,2): 1\n   - Number at (7,4): .\n   - Number at (8,2): 1\n   - Number at (8,3): 2\n   - Number at (8,4): .\n\n   This flag impacts these numbers, so we need to verify the adjacent bomb counts.\n\n6. **Flag at (8,0):** Adjacent to numbers at (7,0), (7,1), (8,1).\n   - Number at (7,0): 1\n   - Number at (7,1): 1\n   - Number at (8,1): 1\n\n   This flag is adjacent to multiple '1's, so we need to ensure that each '1' has exactly one bomb adjacent.\n\n7. **Flag at (9,2):** Adjacent to numbers at (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3).\n   - Number at (8,1): 1\n   - Number at (8,2): 1\n   - Number at (8,3): 2\n   - Number at (9,1): 1\n   - Number at (9,3): 1\n\n   This flag affects these numbers, so we need to ensure that each '1' and '2' has the correct number of adjacent bombs.\n\n### **Step 2: Checking for Potential Conflicts**\n\nNow, let's check if any of the existing flags are in conflict with the adjacent numbers.\n\n1. **Flag at (2,4):** Adjacent to multiple '1's. Each '1' should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since there's a flag at (2,4), which is adjacent to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5), we need to ensure that no other bomb is adjacent to these '1's. However, the flag at (2,5) is already adjacent to the flag at (2,4), which could cause a conflict if the flag at (2,5) is incorrect. But since the flag at (2,5) is also adjacent to the '1' at (2,5), which is satisfied by the flag at (2,4), there's no immediate conflict.\n\n2. **Flag at (2,6):** Adjacent to '1's at (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), and (2,7), and '2's at (3,5), (3,6), and (3,7). The '1's should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The flag at (2,6) satisfies the '1's at (1,5), (1,7), and (2,7). The '1' at (2,5) is satisfied by the flag at (2,4). The '2's at (3,5), (3,6), and (3,7) should have two bombs adjacent. The flag at (2,6) covers one bomb for these '2's, so there should be one more bomb adjacent to each '2'. We'll need to explore these areas further.\n\n3. **Flag at (5,3):** Adjacent to '2' at (5,4), '2' at (6,3), and '3' at (6,4). The '2's should have two bombs adjacent. The flag at (5,3) covers one bomb for the '2' at (5,4) and the '2' at (6,3). The '3' at (6,4) should have three bombs adjacent. The flag at (5,3) covers one bomb for the '3' at (6,4), so there should be two more bombs adjacent to it.\n\n4. **Flag at (6,3):** Adjacent to '2' at (5,4), '3' at (6,4), and unexplored cells. The '2' at (5,4) is already adjacent to the flag at (5,3), so the flag at (6,3) would be the second bomb adjacent to it, satisfying the '2'. The '3' at (6,4) requires three bombs adjacent. The flag at (6,3) covers one bomb, and the unexplored cells around it may contain the remaining bombs.\n\n5. **Flag at (7,3):** Adjacent to '1's at (7,2) and (8,2), and '2' at (8,3). The '1's should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The flag at (7,3) satisfies the '1's at (7,2) and (8,2). The '2' at (8,3) should have two bombs adjacent. The flag at (7,3) covers one bomb, so there should be one more bomb adjacent to it.\n\n6. **Flag at (8,0):** Adjacent to '1's at (7,0), (7,1), and (8,1). The '1's should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The flag at (8,0) satisfies the '1's at (7,0), (7,1), and (8,1). There's no immediate conflict here.\n\n7. **Flag at (9,2):** Adjacent to '1's at (8,1), (8,2), (9,1), and '2' at (8,3). The '1's should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The flag at (9,2) satisfies the '1's at (8,1), (8,2), and (9,1). The '2' at (8,3) should have two bombs adjacent. The flag at (9,2) covers one bomb, so there should be one more bomb adjacent to it.\n\nSo far, none of the existing flags seem to create direct conflicts with the adjacent numbers. However, we need to ensure that all numbers are satisfied and that there are no contradictions.\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Safe Moves**\n\nGiven that there are no immediate conflicts, let's look for cells that can be safely revealed or flags that can be confidently placed.\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number at (3,5): 2**\n\nThe cell at (3,5) shows a '2', indicating that there are two bombs in its adjacent cells. Let's list its adjacent cells:\n\n- (2,4): Flagged (F)\n- (2,5): Flagged (F)\n- (2,6): Flagged (F)\n- (3,4): 1\n- (3,6): 2\n- (4,4): _\n- (4,5): _\n- (4,6): _\n\nCurrently, there are three flags adjacent to (3,5): at (2,4), (2,5), and (2,6). However, the number at (3,5) is '2', meaning only two of these flags can be correct. This indicates that one of these flags is incorrectly placed.\n\n**Possible Incorrect Flags:**\n\n1. **Flag at (2,4):** If this flag is incorrect, then the adjacent '1's at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5) would need to have their bomb counts reassessed.\n\n2. **Flag at (2,5):** If this flag is incorrect, it affects the '1's at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6).\n\n3. **Flag at (2,6):** If this flag is incorrect, it affects the '1's at (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), and (3,7).\n\nGiven that the number at (3,5) is '2' and there are three flags adjacent, one of these flags must be incorrect. To determine which one, we need to look for additional clues.\n\nLet's examine the numbers adjacent to each flag to see if removing any flag would resolve the inconsistency.\n\n**Flag at (2,4):** Adjacent to multiple '1's. If we remove this flag, we need to ensure that each '1' still has exactly one bomb adjacent.\n\n**Flag at (2,5):** Also adjacent to multiple '1's. Removing this flag would require adjusting the bomb counts for these '1's.\n\n**Flag at (2,6):** Adjacent to '1's and '2's. Removing this flag would affect these numbers.\n\nGiven that all three flags are adjacent to '1's that require exactly one bomb, it's challenging to determine which flag is incorrect without more information. Therefore, we might need to explore other areas of the board to gather more clues.\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number at (6,4): 3**\n\nThe cell at (6,4) shows a '3', indicating three bombs in its adjacent cells. Let's list its adjacent cells:\n\n- (5,3): Flagged (F)\n- (5,4): 2\n- (5,5): _\n- (6,3): Flagged (F)\n- (6,5): _\n- (7,3): Flagged (F)\n- (7,4): _\n- (7,5): _\n\nCurrently, there are three flags adjacent to (6,4): at (5,3), (6,3), and (7,3). The number at (6,4) is '3', so all three flags could be correct. However, we need to ensure that these flags do not conflict with other numbers.\n\nLet's check the adjacent numbers:\n\n- **Number at (5,4): 2**\n  - Adjacent to (5,3): Flagged (F)\n  - Adjacent to (5,5): _\n  - Adjacent to (6,3): Flagged (F)\n  - Adjacent to (6,4): 3\n  - Adjacent to (6,5): _\n  - Adjacent to (7,3): Flagged (F)\n  - Adjacent to (7,4): _\n  - Adjacent to (7,5): _\n\nThe '2' at (5,4) requires two bombs adjacent. The flags at (5,3) and (6,3) are adjacent to (5,4), so both flags could be the bombs for this '2'. This seems consistent.\n\n- **Number at (6,3): 2**\n  - Adjacent to (5,2): _\n  - Adjacent to (5,3): Flagged (F)\n  - Adjacent to (5,4): 2\n  - Adjacent to (6,2): _\n  - Adjacent to (6,4): 3\n  - Adjacent to (7,2): _\n  - Adjacent to (7,3): Flagged (F)\n  - Adjacent to (7,4): _\n\nThe '2' at (6,3) requires two bombs adjacent. The flags at (5,3) and (7,3) are adjacent to (6,3), so both flags could be the bombs for this '2'. This is consistent.\n\n- **Number at (7,3): 1**\n  - Adjacent to (6,2): _\n  - Adjacent to (6,3): Flagged (F)\n  - Adjacent to (6,4): 3\n  - Adjacent to (7,2): _\n  - Adjacent to (7,4): _\n  - Adjacent to (8,2): 1\n  - Adjacent to (8,3): 2\n  - Adjacent to (8,4): _\n\nThe '1' at (7,3) requires one bomb adjacent. The flag at (6,3) is adjacent, so this is consistent.\n\nGiven this analysis, the flags at (5,3), (6,3), and (7,3) seem to be correctly placed, satisfying the '3' at (6,4) without creating conflicts with adjacent numbers.\n\n#### **Analyzing the Number at (8,3): 2**\n\nThe cell at (8,3) shows a '2', indicating two bombs in its adjacent cells. Let's list its adjacent cells:\n\n- (7,2): _\n- (7,3): Flagged (F)\n- (7,4): _\n- (8,2): 1\n- (8,4): _\n- (9,2): Flagged (F)\n- (9,3): 1\n- (9,4): _\n\nCurrently, there are two flags adjacent to (8,3): at (7,3) and (9,2). The number at (8,3) is '2', so both flags could be correct. We need to verify if these flags are consistent with the adjacent numbers.\n\nLet's check the adjacent numbers:\n\n- **Number at (7,3): 1**\n  - Adjacent to (6,2): _\n  - Adjacent to (6,3): Flagged (F)\n  - Adjacent to (6,4): 3\n  - Adjacent to (7,2): _\n  - Adjacent to (7,4): _\n  - Adjacent to (8,2): 1\n  - Adjacent to (8,3): 2\n  - Adjacent to (8,4): _\n\nThe '1' at (7,3) requires one bomb adjacent. The flag at (6,3) is adjacent, so this is consistent.\n\n- **Number at (9,2): 1**\n  - Adjacent to (8,1): 1\n  - Adjacent to (8,2): 1\n  - Adjacent to (8,3): 2\n  - Adjacent to (9,1): 1\n  - Adjacent to (9,3): 1\n\nThe '1' at (9,2) requires one bomb adjacent. The flag at (9,2) itself cannot be a bomb (since it's a flag), so the bomb must be among its adjacent cells. However, the flag at (9,2) is adjacent to (8,2), (8,3), and others, but since the flag at (9,2) is already placed, and it's adjacent to (8,3), which has a '2', which is satisfied by the flags at (7,3) and (9,2), this seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the flags at (7,3) and (9,2) are correctly placed, satisfying the '2' at (8,3).\n\n### **Step 4: Looking for Safe Cells to Reveal**\n\nNow that we've verified the existing flags, let's look for cells that can be safely revealed.\n\n#### **Examining the Number at (4,5): 1**\n\nThe cell at (4,5) shows a '1', indicating one bomb in its adjacent cells. Let's list its adjacent cells:\n\n- (3,4): 1\n- (3,5): 2\n- (3,6): 2\n- (4,4): _\n- (4,6): _\n- (5,4): 2\n- (5,5): _\n- (5,6): _\n\nCurrently, there are no flags adjacent to (4,5). Therefore, the bomb must be among the unexplored cells adjacent to it: (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), and (5,6).\n\nHowever, the number at (5,4) is '2', and it's adjacent to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,3), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5), and (6,6). The flag at (5,3) is adjacent to (5,4), satisfying one bomb for the '2' at (5,4). Therefore, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (5,4) among (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5), and (6,6).\n\nGiven that (4,5) is '1', and it's adjacent to (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), and (5,6), and considering that (5,4) already has one bomb adjacent (the flag at (5,3)), the remaining bomb for (5,4) must be among (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,5), and (5,6).\n\nBut (4,5) is '1', so it can only have one bomb adjacent. Therefore, if (4,5) is adjacent to the bomb required by (5,4), then (4,5)'s bomb is already accounted for, and the other adjacent cells to (4,5) can be safely revealed.\n\nLet's consider the cells adjacent to (4,5):\n\n- (4,4): _\n- (4,6): _\n- (5,4): 2 (has one bomb adjacent at (5,3))\n- (5,5): _\n- (5,6): _\n\nSince (5,4) needs one more bomb adjacent, and (4,5) can only have one bomb adjacent, let's analyze the possibilities.\n\n**Scenario 1:** If the bomb adjacent to (4,5) is at (4,4):\n\n- Then, (4,4) is a bomb.\n- This would satisfy the '1' at (4,5).\n- The '2' at (5,4) would have bombs at (5,3) and (4,4), satisfying its count.\n- Therefore, (4,6), (5,5), and (5,6) can be safely revealed.\n\n**Scenario 2:** If the bomb adjacent to (4,5) is at (4,6):\n\n- Then, (4,6) is a bomb.\n- This would satisfy the '1' at (4,5).\n- The '2' at (5,4) would have bombs at (5,3) and (4,6), satisfying its count.\n- Therefore, (4,4), (5,5), and (5,6) can be safely revealed.\n\n**Scenario 3:** If the bomb adjacent to (4,5) is at (5,5):\n\n- Then, (5,5) is a bomb.\n- This would satisfy the '1' at (4,5).\n- The '2' at (5,4) would have bombs at (5,3) and (5,5), satisfying its count.\n- Therefore, (4,4), (4,6), and (5,6) can be safely revealed.\n\nIn all scenarios, there is at least one cell that can be safely revealed. However, to minimize risk, we should choose the cell that is least likely to be a bomb based on the current information.\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells to (4,5):\n\n- (4,4) and (4,6) are both unexplored and could be bombs.\n- (5,5) and (5,6) are unexplored, but (5,5) could be a bomb to satisfy the '2' at (5,4).\n\nGiven that, revealing (4,4) or (4,6) is safer because if they are bombs, they would satisfy both the '1' at (4,5) and the '2' at (5,4). Revealing (5,5) would only satisfy the '2' at (5,4) if it's a bomb, but if it's not, it could still be safe.\n\nHowever, since (4,5) is '1', and it's adjacent to (4,4) and (4,6), both of which are unexplored, and considering that the '2' at (5,4) needs one more bomb adjacent, it's safer to reveal one of (4,4) or (4,6) first.\n\nBetween (4,4) and (4,6), there's no immediate preference, so we can choose either.\n\n**Decision:** Reveal (4,4).\n\n### **Step 5: Finalizing the Move**\n\nBased on the analysis, revealing (4,4) is a safe move because:\n\n1. The cell at (4,5) is '1', indicating one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n2. The adjacent cells to (4,5) are (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), and (5,6).\n3. The number at (5,4) is '2', and it already has one bomb adjacent at (5,3), so it needs one more bomb among its adjacent cells.\n4. If (4,4) is revealed and it's a bomb, it satisfies both the '1' at (4,5) and the '2' at (5,4).\n5. If (4,4) is safe, then the bomb must be at (4,6), which we can handle in subsequent moves.\n\nTherefore, revealing (4,4) provides valuable information without risking stepping on a bomb.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Revealing cell (4,4) is a safe move because it helps satisfy the '1' at (4,5) and the '2' at (5,4) without conflicting with existing flags. If (4,4) is a bomb, it fulfills the adjacent bomb counts; if not, it allows us to proceed safely.\n\n**MOVE:** 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 F 1 F 1 . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 1 2 2 2 . .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n5 _ _ _ F _ 2 3 . . .\n6 _ _ _ F 2 3 . . . .\n7 1 1 _ F . . . . . .\n8 F 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n9 . 1 F 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

No conflict here.\n\n- **Tile (3,7): 'F'** is adjacent to (3,6): '2'.\n  \n'2' with one flag adjacent; implies one more bomb around (3,6).

According to the board, the flags are at:\n\n(2,4), (3,7), (4,6), (5,6), (6,3), (7,3), (8,0)\n\nBut in the \"GAME INFO,\" it's stated that **Flags remaining: 2**. This implies that total flags placed = Total bombs - Flags remaining = 10 - 2 = 8 flags.\n\nHowever, on the board, I can see only 7 flags. There must be one more flag that's not visible on the provided board state, or perhaps I've missed counting one.\n\nLooking back:\n\nLooking at row 8:\n\n8 F 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n\nFlag at (8,0).\n\nRow 9:\n\n9 . 1 F 1 . . . . . .\n\nFlag at (9,3).\n\nWait, earlier I didn't count (9,3) as a flag. Let's recount:\n\n(2,4), (3,7), (4,6), (5,6), (6,3), (7,3), (8,0), (9,3) \u2013 That's 8 flags.\n\nSo, total flags placed: 8\n\nFlags remaining: 2\n\nTotal bombs: 10\n\nThus, all flags have been placed correctly as per the count.\n\n### Step 4: Deciding the Next Move\n\nGiven that all 8 flags are placed, and there are 10 bombs, there are still 2 bombs left to flag. However, since we have only 2 flags remaining, we need to carefully choose where to place them.\n\nLet's identify potential bomb locations based on the analysis:\n\n1. **Adjacent to (3,6): '2' with one flag (3,7):**\n   - Possible bomb locations: (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (4,5), (4,7)\n   \n2. **Adjacent to (5,5): '2' with one flag (5,6):**\n   - Possible bomb locations: (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,6)\n   \n3. **Adjacent to (6,5): '3' with one flag (5,6):**\n   - Possible bomb locations: (5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n   \n4. **Adjacent to (6,4): '2' with one flag (6,3):**\n   - Possible bomb locations: (5,3), (5,4), (7,4), (7,5)\n   \n5. **Adjacent to (8,2): '2' with one flag (8,0):**\n   - Possible bomb locations: (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), (8,3), (9,2), (9,3)\n   \n6. **Adjacent to (9,1): '1' with one flag (8,0):**\n   - No additional bombs needed here.\n   \n7. **Adjacent to (9,3): '1' with no adjacent flags:**\n   - Need to find one bomb in adjacent squares: (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4)\n   \nNow, let's try to find overlaps or certain bomb locations.\n\n#### Analyzing (6,5): '3' with one flag\n\nAdjacent to (6,5):\n\n(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\nFlags: (5,6) is flagged.\n\nSo, two more bombs among: (5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\nLooking at (5,5): '2' with one flag (5,6), so one more bomb among: (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,6)\n\nComparing with (6,5), overlapping possible bomb locations: (5,4), (6,4), (6,6)\n\nSo, likely one bomb among (5,4), (6,4), (6,6)\n\nLooking at (6,4): '2' with one flag (6,3), so one more bomb among: (5,3), (5,4), (7,4), (7,5)\n\nPotential overlaps: (5,4)\n\nSo, (5,4) is a strong candidate for a bomb.\n\n#### Placing a Flag at (5,4)\n\nLet's consider placing a flag at (5,4).\n\n**Impact:**\n\n- (5,5): '2' with one flag (5,6) and one flag at (5,4) \u2013 satisfies the '2'.\n- (6,4): '2' with one flag (6,3) and one flag at (5,4) \u2013 satisfies the '2'.\n- (6,5): '3' with one flag (5,6) and one flag at (5,4) \u2013 still needs one more bomb.\n\nSo, placing a flag at (5,4) seems valid.\n\n#### Next, Identifying the Second Bomb\n\nWe have one more flag to place.\n\nLooking at (3,6): '2' with one flag (3,7), so one more bomb among: (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (4,5), (4,7)\n\nLooking at (4,5): '1' with one flag (4,6), so no other bombs adjacent to it. Therefore, (4,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at (2,6): Unexplored, potential bomb.\n\nLooking at (2,7): Unexplored, potential bomb.\n\nLooking at (3,5): Unexplored, potential bomb.\n\nLooking at (4,7): Unexplored, potential bomb.\n\nAmong these, let's see if any are more likely.\n\nConsidering (2,7) and (4,7) are unexplored, let's see if there's any clue.\n\nLooking at (2,7): Adjacent to (2,6): '1' with no adjacent flags.\n\nIf we place a flag at (2,7):\n\nImpact on (2,6): '1' with one flag at (2,7) \u2013 no other bombs should be adjacent.\n\nBut (2,6) has other adjacent squares: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n\nFlags: (2,7) is flagged.\n\nSo, no other bombs adjacent to (2,6).\n\nThis seems valid.\n\n#### Placing a Flag at (2,7)\n\n**Impact:**\n\n- (3,6): '2' with one flag (3,7) and one flag at (2,7) \u2013 satisfies the '2'.\n  \nThus, placing a flag at (2,7) also seems valid.\n\n### Verifying the Flag Placements\n\nLet's ensure that placing flags at (5,4) and (2,7) doesn't create any conflicts.\n\n1. **Flag at (5,4):**\n   - Adjacent to (5,5): '2' with flags at (5,6) and (5,4) \u2013 satisfies '2'.\n   - Adjacent to (6,4): '2' with flags at (6,3) and (5,4) \u2013 satisfies '2'.\n   - Adjacent to (6,5): '3' with flags at (5,6) and (5,4) \u2013 still needs one more bomb, which is acceptable.\n\n2. **Flag at (2,7):**\n   - Adjacent to (3,6): '2' with flags at (3,7) and (2,7) \u2013 satisfies '2'.\n   - Adjacent to (2,6): '1' with flag at (2,7) \u2013 no other bombs should be adjacent.\n\nNo conflicts observed.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical next moves are to place flags at (5,4) and (2,7) to mark the remaining bombs.\n\nHowever, since we can make only one move at a time, we'll choose one of these.\n\n**Choosing to place a flag at (5,4):**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Placing a flag at (5,4) satisfies the '2' on both (5,5) and (6,4) and partially satisfies the '3' on (6,5), while avoiding any conflicts with adjacent numbers.\n\n**MOVE:** 5,4,true\n\n### Potential Next Move\n\nAfter placing the flag at (5,4), the next logical step would be to place the remaining flag at (2,7).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Placing a flag at (2,7) satisfies the '2' on (3,6) and ensures that (2,6) has no other adjacent bombs.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,7,true\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all bombs are correctly flagged without violating any of the Minesweeper rules.", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 F 1 _ 1 . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 1 2 F 2 . .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F . . .\n5 _ _ _ F _ 2 3 . . .\n6 _ _ _ F 2 3 . . . .\n7 1 1 _ F . . . . . .\n8 F 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n9 . 1 F 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Let's examine each numbered tile and see if we can deduce the locations of bombs or safe squares.\n\n#### Tile (0,7): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)\n\n- (0,8) and (1,8) are unexplored (`.`).\n- (1,7) is flagged (`F`) at (2,7), which is adjacent to (1,7).\n\nSince there's already a flag adjacent to (0,7), there cannot be another bomb adjacent to it. Therefore, (0,8) and (1,8) are safe to reveal.\n\n#### Tile (1,3): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n- (2,4) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nWith one flag adjacent, there are no other bombs around (1,3). So, all other adjacent tiles are safe.\n\n#### Tile (1,4): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\n- (2,4) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nSimilar to (1,3), there's one flag adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\n#### Tile (1,7): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)\n\n- (2,7) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nAgain, one flag adjacent means the other adjacent tiles are safe.\n\n#### Tile (2,3): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n- (2,4) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nOne flag adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\n#### Tile (3,3): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n- (2,4) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nOne flag adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\n#### Tile (3,5): Number '2'\nAdjacent tiles: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\n- (2,4) and (3,6) are flagged (`F`).\n  \nWith two flags adjacent, the number '2' is satisfied, so the remaining adjacent tiles are safe.\n\n#### Tile (3,7): Number '2'\nAdjacent tiles: (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\n- (3,6) and (4,7) are flagged (`F`).\n  \nTwo flags adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\n#### Tile (4,5): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\n- (3,6) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nOne flag adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\n#### Tile (5,5): Number '2'\nAdjacent tiles: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n- (5,4) and (6,5) are flagged (`F`).\n  \nTwo flags adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\n#### Tile (5,6): Number '3'\nAdjacent tiles: (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\n- (5,4) and (6,5) are flagged (`F`).\n  \nOnly two flags adjacent, but the number is '3'. This indicates that there is one more bomb adjacent. Let's look at the unexplored tiles: (4,7), (5,7), (6,7).\n\n#### Tile (6,5): Number '3'\nAdjacent tiles: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n- (5,4) and (6,4) are flagged (`F`).\n  \nTwo flags adjacent, so there's one more bomb among: (5,6), (7,5), (7,6).\n\n#### Tile (7,0): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (6,-1), (6,0), (6,1), (7,-1), (7,1), (8,-1), (8,0), (8,1)\n\nSince some coordinates are out of bounds, we consider only (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1).\n\n- (8,0) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nOne flag adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\n#### Tile (7,1): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n\n- (8,0) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nOne flag adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\n#### Tile (8,1): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\n- (8,0) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nOne flag adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\n#### Tile (8,3): Number '2'\nAdjacent tiles: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n\n- (7,3) and (9,3) are flagged (`F`).\n  \nTwo flags adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\n#### Tile (9,1): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,0), (10,1), (10,2)\n\nSince (10,0), (10,1), (10,2) are out of bounds, we consider (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2).\n\n- (8,0) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nOne flag adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\n#### Tile (9,3): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4)\n\nConsidering in-bounds tiles: (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4).\n\n- (9,3) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nWait, looking back: (9,3) is flagged (`F`), but we're analyzing tile (9,3) which is a number '1'. This seems contradictory. Let's double-check.\n\nWait, reviewing the board:\n\n```\n9 . 1 F 1 . . . . .\n```\n\nYes, tile (9,2) is '1', (9,3) is flagged (`F`), and (9,4) is '1'.\n\nSo, for tile (9,2): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3)\n\nConsidering in-bounds tiles: (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3).\n\n- (9,3) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nOne flag adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\nFor tile (9,4): Number '1'\nAdjacent tiles: (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,3), (9,5), (10,3), (10,4), (10,5)\n\nConsidering in-bounds tiles: (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,3), (9,5).\n\n- (9,3) is flagged (`F`).\n  \nOne flag adjacent, so the rest are safe.\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify several safe moves:\n\n1. **Tile (0,8)**: Adjacent to (0,7) which has a '1' with one flag adjacent.\n2. **Tile (1,8)**: Adjacent to (1,7) which has a '1' with one flag adjacent.\n3. **Tile (2,2)**: Adjacent to (1,3) which has a '1' with one flag adjacent.\n4. **Tile (2,5)**: Adjacent to (1,4) which has a '1' with one flag adjacent.\n5. **Tile (4,6)**: Adjacent to (3,5) which has a '2' with two flags adjacent.\n\nLet's choose one of these to reveal.\n\n### Choosing the Next Move\n\nConsidering the potential to uncover multiple safe tiles, revealing **Tile (2,2)** seems promising as it's adjacent to multiple numbered tiles and could provide more information.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Tile (2,2) is adjacent to (1,3) which has a '1' with one flag adjacent, ensuring (2,2) is safe.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,2,false", "flags_remaining": 0, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 F 1 _ F . .\n3 _ _ _ 1 1 2 F 2 F .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 1 F . . .\n5 _ _ _ F _ 2 3 . . .\n6 _ _ _ F 2 3 . . . .\n7 1 1 _ F . . . . . .\n8 F 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n9 . 1 F 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

This matches the number '2', so no conflict here.\n   - At position (5,6), the number '3' has three flags adjacent: (5,5), (6,5), and (7,3). This matches the number '3', so no conflict here.\n   - At position (6,4), the number '2' has one flag adjacent: (6,3). This means there must be another bomb adjacent to (6,4). The only unexplored adjacent tile is (6,5), which must be a bomb.\n\n2. **Flag Placement:**\n   - Since we have identified that (6,5) must be a bomb, we should place a flag there.\n\n3. **Flag Remaining:**\n   - The game info states that there are 0 flags remaining, but we have identified a bomb that needs to be flagged. This suggests that one of the existing flags might be incorrectly placed. However, based on the current analysis, all existing flags seem correct. Therefore, we should proceed to reveal a safe tile.\n\n### Next Move:\nGiven that we have identified a bomb at (6,5) but have no flags remaining, we should reveal a safe tile. The tile at (6,6) is unexplored and should be safe to reveal.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The number '2' at (6,4) has one adjacent flag at (6,3), so the unexplored tile at (6,5) must be a bomb.
