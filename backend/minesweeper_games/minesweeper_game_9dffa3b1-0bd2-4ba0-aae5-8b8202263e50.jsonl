Looking at position (5,2), this must be where a bomb is located because:\n- It satisfies the \"2\" next to it\n- It explains the \"1\" to its left and right\n- No other configuration would satisfy all these numbers simultaneously\n\n3. There are no obvious conflicts between numbers and flags (since no flags are placed yet).\n\n4. This is a safe deduction based on the numbers we can see.\n\nEXPLANATION: Position (5,2) must be a bomb based on the pattern \"1 2 . 1\" in row 5.
