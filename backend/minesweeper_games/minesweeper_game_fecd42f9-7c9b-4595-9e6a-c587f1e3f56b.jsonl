This means it still needs 2 more bombs adjacent to it. The only remaining unexplored spaces next to this 3 are at (0,8), (1,8), and (2,8). Since we need exactly 2 more bombs among these 3 spaces, I can't determine with certainty which ones contain bombs.\n\nHowever, I notice that at position (7,3) there's a 1, which means exactly one bomb is adjacent. Looking at the unexplored squares around it, positions (7,2) and (7,4) are candidates. The position (6,4) is already revealed as a 1, and this 1 can only have its bomb at (7,4) since all other adjacent squares are either revealed or cannot contain bombs based on other revealed numbers.
