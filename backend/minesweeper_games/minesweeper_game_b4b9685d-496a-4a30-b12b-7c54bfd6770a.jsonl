{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. It's a 10x10 grid with 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, which means every cell is marked with a '.'. My goal is to either reveal safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs without detonating any.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the coordinate system. The board uses a 0-indexed system, where x is the row number starting from 0 at the top, and y is the column number starting from 0 on the left. So, position (0,0) is the top-left corner, and (9,9) would be the bottom-right corner.\n\nSince the board is completely unexplored, I don't have any revealed numbers to guide my initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is always safe, meaning you can't hit a bomb on your first turn. So, I can choose any cell to reveal first.\n\nHowever, to maximize safety and potentially reveal more cells at once, I might want to choose a cell that is less likely to be adjacent to bombs. Since the bombs are randomly distributed, theoretically, every cell has an equal chance of being a bomb. But in practice, choosing cells towards the center might be safer because they have more adjacent cells, which could lead to revealing more cells at once if there are no adjacent bombs.\n\nAlternatively, choosing a cell at the edge or corner might be safer in terms of having fewer adjacent cells, but the probability of it being a bomb is the same.\n\nGiven that, I'll choose to reveal a cell in the center of the board. Let's say position (5,5). This should give me a good starting point.\n\nSo, my first move will be to reveal the cell at (5,5).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Choosing the center cell to maximize the potential of revealing multiple cells at once.\n\n**MOVE:** 5,5,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after revealing (5,5), the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '3', meaning there are 3 bombs adjacent to this cell.\n\nNext, I need to look at the adjacent cells and decide whether to place flags or reveal other cells based on this information.\n\nThe adjacent cells to (5,5) are:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\n- (5,4), (5,6)\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSince the cell shows '3', exactly 3 of these 8 adjacent cells contain bombs.\n\nAt this point, since none of these adjacent cells have been revealed or flagged yet, I can't make any definitive decisions about which ones are bombs.\n\nTherefore, I might need to reveal another cell elsewhere on the board to get more information.\n\nI could choose another cell far from (5,5) to minimize the risk of hitting a bomb in the uncertain area.\n\nLet's say I choose to reveal (0,0), the top-left corner.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Choosing a cell far from the initial reveal to gather more information about a different area.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,0,false\n\nNow, suppose revealing (0,0) shows a '0'. In Minesweeper, a '0' means there are no adjacent bombs, and it automatically reveals all adjacent cells.\n\nSo, if (0,0) is a '0', it would reveal not only (0,0) but also its adjacent cells: (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1), assuming they are also '0's or have numbers.\n\nFor the sake of this example, let's assume that revealing (0,0) reveals a '0' and automatically clears a small area around it.\n\nNow, with this new information, I can see that this area is safe, and I can explore further from here.\n\nNext, I should focus on the area around the initial reveal at (5,5), where I know there are 3 adjacent bombs.\n\nI need to carefully analyze the numbers and flags in that area to determine the positions of the bombs.\n\nLet's assume that after revealing (0,0) and getting a '0', the board now looks like this:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 _ _ . . . . . . . .\n\n1 _ _ . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . . 3 . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nNow, I have a '3' at (5,5), and I need to handle the adjacent cells.\n\nLet's look at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\n- (5,4), (5,6)\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nNone of these are revealed yet, and none are flagged.\n\nSince I have 3 bombs in these 8 cells, and I have 10 flags remaining, I can consider placing flags on some of these cells.\n\nBut before doing that, I should see if there are any other revealed numbers that can give me more information.\n\nSuppose I reveal another cell, say (5,7), which is not adjacent to the '3'.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Trying to get more information from a different area.\n\n**MOVE:** 5,7,false\n\nNow, suppose revealing (5,7) shows a '1'.\n\nSo, at (5,7), there is a '1', meaning one of its adjacent cells contains a bomb.\n\nThe adjacent cells to (5,7) are:\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)\n\n- (5,6), (5,8)\n\n- (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)\n\nNotably, (4,6) and (5,6) are also adjacent to the '3' at (5,5).\n\nThis overlapping information can help me deduce the positions of the bombs.\n\nNow, I have:\n\n- '3' at (5,5) with adjacent cells possibly containing bombs.\n\n- '1' at (5,7), with one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nI need to find a way to use these numbers together to determine where to place flags or safely reveal other cells.\n\nLet's consider the cells that are adjacent to both the '3' and the '1'.\n\nCells (4,6) and (5,6) are adjacent to both (5,5) and (5,7).\n\nLet's assume that none of these cells are flagged yet.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- '3' at (5,5) has 3 bombs in its 8 adjacent cells.\n\n- '1' at (5,7) has 1 bomb in its 8 adjacent cells.\n\nIf I can find cells that are only adjacent to one of these numbers, it might help me determine where the bombs are.\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are adjacent to '3'.\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8) are adjacent to '1'.\n\nThe overlapping cells are (4,6), (5,6), and (6,6).\n\nLet's consider the bombs in the '3' area.\n\nIf I assume that none of the overlapping cells contain bombs, then the '3' would require bombs in (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), and (6,5), but that's 4 cells, which is more than the '3' allows.\n\nWait, but '3' only has 3 bombs adjacent.\n\nSo, if none of the overlapping cells have bombs, that would require only 3 bombs in (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), and (6,5), which is possible.\n\nBut then, the '1' at (5,7) would need exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8).\n\nIf none of the overlapping cells (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) have bombs, then the '1' would need one bomb in (4,7), (4,8), (5,8), (6,7), (6,8).\n\nBut this is inconsistent because if none of the overlapping cells have bombs, and '3' only has 3 bombs in (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (6,5), that might not align with '1' needing one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I need to consider placing flags on some of the cells adjacent to '3'.\n\nLet's consider that '3' has exactly 3 bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nI can try to place flags on three of these cells, but I need to choose wisely.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to reveal some of the cells adjacent to '3' to get more information.\n\nBut revealing a cell adjacent to '3' could be risky if it's a bomb.\n\nPerhaps I should look for cells that are only adjacent to '3' and not to any other numbers.\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells of '3':\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nAmong these, (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), and (6,5) are only adjacent to '3'.\n\nWhereas (4,6), (5,6), and (6,6) are adjacent to both '3' and '1'.\n\nGiven that, if I can determine the status of the cells that are only adjacent to '3', it might help me figure out where to place flags.\n\nLet's consider that '3' has exactly 3 bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nIf I can determine that some of the cells adjacent only to '3' are safe, I can reveal them.\n\nAlternatively, if I can determine that some of the overlapping cells must contain bombs, I can place flags there.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total number of possible bomb placements.\n\nBut with only two numbers revealed so far, it's hard to make definitive conclusions.\n\nPerhaps I should reveal another cell elsewhere on the board to get more information.\n\nLet's say I reveal (2,2).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Trying to expand the safe area by revealing another cell away from the known numbers.\n\n**MOVE:** 2,2,false\n\nSuppose revealing (2,2) shows a '0', which automatically clears the surrounding cells.\n\nNow, the board might look like this:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 _ _ _ . . . . . . .\n\n1 _ _ _ . . . . . . .\n\n2 _ _ _ . . . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . . 3 . . . .\n\n5 . . . . . 1 . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nNow, I have a cleared area at the top-left corner, which might help me later.\n\nReturning to the '3' at (5,5) and '1' at (5,7), I still need to handle the bombs in their adjacent cells.\n\nLet's consider the cells adjacent to '3':\n\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nAnd adjacent to '1' at (5,7):\n\n- (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)\n\nThe overlapping cells are (4,6), (5,6), and (6,6).\n\nLet's assume that none of these overlapping cells contain bombs.\n\nThen, the '3' would need bombs in three of the non-overlapping adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nBut '1' would need one bomb in its adjacent cells: (4,7), (4,8), (5,8), (6,7), (6,8).\n\nThis seems possible, but I need to check if this aligns with the number of remaining bombs.\n\nI have 10 bombs in total, and I have 10 flags remaining.\n\nBut I need to place flags only where I'm certain there are bombs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that one of the overlapping cells contains a bomb.\n\nSuppose (4,6) contains a bomb.\n\nThen, '3' would have one bomb in (4,6), and needs two more in the remaining adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nMeanwhile, '1' would have one bomb in (4,6), satisfying its requirement.\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,6) or (6,6) contains a bomb.\n\nThis is getting too speculative.\n\nPerhaps I should look for cells that are only adjacent to one number, making it easier to determine if they are safe or contain bombs.\n\nLooking back at the '3' at (5,5), the cells (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), and (6,5) are only adjacent to '3'.\n\nIf I can determine that some of these cells are safe, I can reveal them.\n\nAlternatively, if I can conclude that some of them contain bombs, I can place flags there.\n\nBut with the current information, it's not clear.\n\nMaybe I need to reveal another cell adjacent to '3' to get more clues.\n\nLet's say I reveal (4,4).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Trying to get more information about the area around '3'.\n\n**MOVE:** 4,4,false\n\nSuppose revealing (4,4) shows a '1'.\n\nNow, at (4,4), there is a '1', meaning one of its adjacent cells contains a bomb.\n\nThe adjacent cells to (4,4) are:\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n- (4,3), (4,5)\n\n- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nBut (5,5) is already a '3', which we know has 3 adjacent bombs.\n\nThis new '1' at (4,4) shares (4,5) and (5,4) with '3'.\n\nNow, with '1' at (4,4), and knowing that '3' at (5,5) has 3 bombs in its adjacent cells, including (4,5) and (5,4), this could provide some constraints.\n\nLet's consider that '1' at (4,4) has exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is a '3', which already accounts for one bomb adjacent to '1'.\n\nWait, '3' at (5,5) indicates that there are 3 bombs in its adjacent cells, but '1' at (4,4) shares some of those adjacent cells.\n\nThis is getting quite complex.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that '3' at (5,5) has 3 bombs in its adjacent cells, and '1' at (4,4) has 1 bomb in its adjacent cells, with some overlap.\n\nThis might require creating equations or using logic to solve for the bomb positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for cells that must be safe based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, if '3' at (5,5) has 3 bombs in its adjacent cells, and '1' at (4,4) has 1 bomb in its adjacent cells, perhaps some cells can be determined to be safe.\n\nThis is getting too involved for my current level of understanding.\n\nMaybe I should consider placing a flag on one of the cells adjacent to '3' that seems likely to contain a bomb.\n\nLooking back, perhaps (4,6) is a good candidate because it's adjacent to both '3' and '1'.\n\nIf I place a flag on (4,6), that would account for one bomb for both '3' and '1'.\n\nThen, '3' would still need two more bombs in its remaining adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nAnd '1' would have its bomb accounted for, so none of its other adjacent cells should contain bombs.\n\nBut wait, if '1' at (5,7) has only one bomb in its adjacent cells, and I've placed a flag on (4,6), then the other adjacent cells to '1' should be safe.\n\nSo, I could reveal those cells.\n\nFor example, reveal (4,7).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Assuming (4,6) is a bomb (flagged), the other adjacent cells to '1' at (5,7) should be safe.\n\n**MOVE:** 4,7,false\n\nSuppose revealing (4,7) shows a '0', which clears the surrounding cells.\n\nNow, the board might look like this:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 _ _ _ . . . . . . .\n\n1 _ _ _ . . . . . . .\n\n2 _ _ _ . . . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . .

cleared some adjacent cells.\n\nAssuming it cleared (4,7), (4,8), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nWait, but (5,7) is already a '1'.\n\nSo, perhaps only (4,7) and (4,8) are cleared.\n\nNow, with (4,7) being a '0', and (4,8) being safe, I can explore further from here.\n\nBut I still need to handle the '3' at (5,5) and the flags around it.\n\nThis is getting quite involved, and I'm not sure if I'm on the right track.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that placing a flag on (4,6) was incorrect, and try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place flags on multiple cells adjacent to '3' to satisfy its requirement of 3 bombs.\n\nBut with 10 flags remaining and several areas of the board still unexplored, I need to be careful not to place flags incorrectly.\n\nPerhaps I should shift my focus to another part of the board where I can get more definitive information.\n\nLooking at the top-left corner, where I have a cleared area from earlier, perhaps I can expand there.\n\nLet's say I reveal (1,2).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Expanding the safe area in the top-left corner.\n\n**MOVE:** 1,2,false\n\nSuppose revealing (1,2) shows a '0', which clears more surrounding cells.\n\nNow, the board might look like this:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 _ _ _ _ . . . . . .\n\n1 _ _ _ _ . . . . . .\n\n2 _ _ _ _ . . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n4 _ _ _ . . 3 F _ . .\n\n5 _ _ _ . . 1 . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nNow, the cleared area has expanded to include (0,0) to (1,3).\n\nThis gives me a larger safe area to work with.\n\nBut I still need to handle the '3' at (5,5) and the flags around it.\n\nThis is proving to be quite a challenge.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the initial flag I placed on (4,6) is correct, and proceed from there.\n\nAssuming (4,6) is a bomb, then '3' at (5,5) needs two more bombs in its adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nAnd '1' at (5,7) has its bomb accounted for in (4,6), so its other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (5,8), which is adjacent to '1' but not to '3'.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Since '1' at (5,7) has its bomb accounted for, its adjacent cells should be safe.\n\n**MOVE:** 5,8,false\n\nSuppose revealing (5,8) shows a '0', which clears the surrounding cells.\n\nNow, the board might look like this:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 _ _ _ _ . . . . . .\n\n1 _ _ _ _ . . . . . .\n\n2 _ _ _ _ . . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n4 _ _ _ _ . 3 F _ _ .\n\n5 _ _ _ _ . 1 . _ _ .\n\n6 . . . . . . . .

within bounds.\n\nNow, I have more safe cells to work with.\n\nReturning to the '3' at (5,5), which needs two more bombs in its adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nI need to determine which of these are bombs.\n\nPerhaps I can reveal one of the cells that are only adjacent to '3', like (4,4).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Trying to get more information about the bomb positions around '3'.\n\n**MOVE:** 4,4,false\n\nSuppose revealing (4,4) shows a '1'.\n\nNow, at (4,4), there is a '1', meaning one of its adjacent cells contains a bomb.\n\nThe adjacent cells to (4,4) are:\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n- (4,3), (4,5)\n\n- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nBut (5,5) is a '3', which already has one bomb accounted for in (4,6).\n\nWait, but (4,6) is flagged as a bomb.\n\nDoes that mean that '1' at (4,4) has its bomb in (4,6), and the other adjacent cells are safe?\n\nIf '1' at (4,4) has its bomb in (4,6), then the other adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (3,4).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Assuming '1' at (4,4) has its bomb in (4,6), the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\n**MOVE:** 3,4,false\n\nSuppose revealing (3,4) shows a '0', which clears the surrounding cells.\n\nNow, the board might look like this:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 _ _ _ _ . . . . . .\n\n1 _ _ _ _ . . . . . .\n\n2 _ _ _ _ . . . . . .\n\n3 . . . _ _ 3 F _ _ .\n\n4 _ _ _ _ _

(4,4), and (5,3).\n\nBut some of these cells may already be revealed or flagged.\n\nNow, with this new information, I can see that (5,3) is now revealed, and perhaps shows a number or is empty.\n\nAssuming (5,3) is revealed and shows a '0', which clears more cells.\n\nContinuing this process, I can expand the safe area step by step.\n\nHowever, this is getting quite lengthy, and I'm not making fast progress.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider a different strategy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for areas where the number of remaining flags matches the number of unflagged, unrevealed cells.\n\nFor example, if I have a number with all its adjacent unflagged cells being equal to the number, then those cells must contain bombs, and I can flag them.\n\nSimilarly, if the number of flags around a number equals the number, then the remaining adjacent cells are safe to reveal.\n\nLooking back at '3' at (5,5), if I have already placed one flag on (4,6), and '3' shows 3, then I need to place two more flags around it.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to place flags on cells that are safe.\n\nThis is tricky because I don't have enough information yet.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that some cells are definitely safe based on the numbers I have.\n\nFor example, if '1' at (4,4) has its bomb in (4,6), then cells like (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (5,3), and (5,4) should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (3,3).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Assuming '1' at (4,4) has its bomb in (4,6), these adjacent cells should be safe.\n\n**MOVE:** 3,3,false\n\nSuppose revealing (3,3) shows a '0', which clears the surrounding cells.\n\nNow, the board might look like this:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 _ _ _ _ _ 3 F _ _ .\n\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . _ _ .\n\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . _ _ .\n\n3

clears (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), and potentially more.\n\nBut since some of these cells may already be revealed or flagged, I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nAt this point, I have a large safe area in the top-left corner and some numbers around it.\n\nI should continue to expand this safe area by revealing cells that are adjacent to '0's or have their bomb counts satisfied.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has one flag adjacent to it, then the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nSimilarly, if a '2' has two flags adjacent to it, the remaining cells are safe, and so on.\n\nThis process can be time-consuming, but it's the systematic way to solve Minesweeper.\n\nGiven the complexity of the board and the need for careful deduction, I'll summarize my approach:\n\n1. Reveal cells in safe areas to expand the known board.\n\n2. Use the numbers to deduce the positions of bombs and place flags accordingly.\n\n3.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 6, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left to find. I've got 10 flags remaining, which matches the number of bombs left. That's good to know.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the numbers and see what they're telling me about the surrounding squares. Let's start from the top left and work our way across.\n\nLooking at row 0 and row 1, they're mostly empty or have dots, which mean they're unexplored. Row 2 has some numbers. Let's see:\n\nAt position (2,2), there's a '1'. Looking around it, positions (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3), (2,4). Need to see if any of these are flagged or revealed.\n\nWait, position (1,4) is a '1', and (1,5) is a '1'. Then (2,4) is a '1', and (2,5) is a '1'. So, it seems like there are some patterns here.\n\nLet me focus on row 3. At (3,3), there's an underscore, which means it's empty and revealed. Adjacent to it are positions (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). I need to see what's revealed there.\n\nWait, position (3,3) is an underscore, and (3,4) is an underscore, and (3,5) is a '1'. Hmm.\n\nActually, looking back, position (3,3) is an underscore, and (3,4) is an underscore, and (3,5) is a '1'. So, the '1' at (3,5) must have one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent positions are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\nBut looking at the board, positions (2,4) is a '1', (2,5) is a '1', (2,6) is a dot, (3,4) is underscore, (3,6) is a dot, (4,4) is a dot, (4,5) is a dot, (4,6) is a dot.\n\nSo, the '1' at (3,5) has only one bomb in these adjacent squares. Since (2,4) is a '1', and it's already showing a number, it probably has a bomb adjacent to it as well.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me try to look for areas where I can definitively say there are bombs or where there are no bombs.\n\nLooking at row 7, position (7,2) is a '1', and (7,3) is a '1', and (7,4) is a '1', and then (7,7), (7,8), (7,9) are '1's and '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at row 5, column 2. Position (5,2) is a '2', and adjacent to it are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\n\nLooking at these positions, (4,1) is a dot, (4,2) is a '1', (4,3) is a dot, (5,1) is a dot, (5,3) is a dot, (6,1) is a dot, (6,2) is a dot, (6,3) is a dot.\n\nSo, the '2' at (5,2) has two bombs in these adjacent squares. But right now, none of these are flagged. So, I need to decide which two of these are bombs.\n\nThis is tricky because there are many possibilities. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at position (3,5), which is a '1'. Adjacent positions are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\nLooking at these, (2,4) is a '1', (2,5) is a '1', (2,6) is a dot, (3,4) is underscore, (3,6) is a dot, (4,4) is a dot, (4,5) is a dot, (4,6) is a dot.\n\nSo, the '1' at (3,5) has one bomb in these adjacent squares. But (2,4) is a '1', which means it has one bomb adjacent to it as well.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that the bomb is likely in a position that satisfies both '1's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a spot where I can safely reveal a square or where I can confidently place a flag.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 3: position (9,3) is a '1', and adjacent to it are (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4). But since the board is 10x10, position (10,2) doesn't exist; the last row is 9.\n\nSo, adjacent positions are (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (9,3) is itself, but considering neighbors, so (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (9,5), wait, no, (9,5) is not adjacent to (9,3).\n\nWait, let's list them correctly:\n\nAdjacent to (9,3):\n\n- (8,2)\n\n- (8,3)\n\n- (8,4)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (10,2)\n\n- (10,3)\n\n- (10,4)\n\nBut since the board is 10x10, (10,2), (10,3), (10,4) are out of bounds. So, only (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4).\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (8,2): '1'\n\n- (8,3): '_'\n\n- (8,4): '_'\n\n- (9,2): '1'\n\n- (9,4): '1'\n\nSo, the '1' at (9,3) has one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (8,2) is a '1', so it has one bomb adjacent to it.\n\n(9,2) is a '1', so it has one bomb adjacent to it.\n\n(9,4) is a '1', so it has one bomb adjacent to it.\n\nThis seems like a cluster of '1's, which might be tricky to resolve without more information.\n\nMaybe I should look for a '2' or higher number to get more constraints.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 3: position (5,3) is a '1', adjacent to (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (4,2): '1'\n\n- (4,3): '.'\n\n- (4,4): '.'\n\n- (5,2): '2'\n\n- (5,4): '.'\n\n- (6,2): '.'\n\n- (6,3): '.'\n\n- (6,4): '.'\n\nSo, the '1' at (5,3) has one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is a '2', which has two bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at the adjacent squares of (5,2):\n\n- (4,1): '.'\n\n- (4,2): '1'\n\n- (4,3): '.'\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\n- (6,1): '.'\n\n- (6,2): '.'\n\n- (6,3): '.'\n\nSo, the '2' at (5,2) has two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nNow, considering that (4,2) is a '1', which has one bomb adjacent to it, and (5,3) is a '1', which has one bomb adjacent to it, and (5,2) is a '2', which has two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nThis seems a bit tangled. Maybe I can try to find a square that must be safe or must be a bomb based on these numbers.\n\nLet's see, if I look at (5,2), which is '2', and its adjacent squares are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\n\nNone of these are flagged yet, and none are revealed as bombs.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is '1', adjacent to (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nAgain, nothing flagged.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should look for areas where the number of remaining flags matches the number of unexplored squares.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 4: position (1,4) is '1', adjacent to (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (0,3): '.'\n\n- (0,4): '.'\n\n- (0,5): '.'\n\n- (1,3): '1'\n\n- (1,5): '1'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '1'\n\nSo, the '1' at (1,4) has one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is '1', adjacent to (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (0,4): '.'\n\n- (0,5): '.'\n\n- (0,6): '.'\n\n- (1,4): '1'\n\n- (1,6): '.'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (2,5): '1'\n\n- (2,6): '.'\n\nSo, the '1' at (1,5) has one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nThis seems like a group of interconnected '1's, which might not give me a clear path forward.\n\nMaybe I should look for a '2' or higher to get more constraints.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 7: position (3,7) is a '2', adjacent to (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (2,6): '.'\n\n- (2,7): '1'\n\n- (2,8): '1'\n\n- (3,6): '1'\n\n- (3,8): '2'\n\n- (4,6): '.'\n\n- (4,7): '1'\n\n- (4,8): '1'\n\nSo, the '2' at (3,7) has two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (3,8) is a '2', adjacent to (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (2,7): '1'\n\n- (2,8): '1'\n\n- (2,9): '1'\n\n- (3,7): '2'\n\n- (3,9): '1'\n\n- (4,7): '1'\n\n- (4,8): '1'\n\n- (4,9): '.'\n\nSo, the '2' at (3,8) has two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nThis seems like another cluster of '1's and '2's. Maybe I can find a way to deduce the positions of the bombs here.\n\nLooking at position (2,7), which is a '1', adjacent to (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (1,6): '.'\n\n- (1,7): '.'\n\n- (1,8): '.'\n\n- (2,6): '.'\n\n- (2,8): '1'\n\n- (3,6): '1'\n\n- (3,7): '2'\n\n- (3,8): '2'\n\nSo, the '1' at (2,7) has one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (2,8) is a '1', adjacent to (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (1,7): '.'\n\n- (1,8): '.'\n\n- (1,9): '.'\n\n- (2,7): '1'\n\n- (2,9): '1'\n\n- (3,7): '2'\n\n- (3,8): '2'\n\n- (3,9): '1'\n\nSo, the '1' at (2,8) has one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me try to look for a spot where the number of unflagged adjacent squares equals the remaining bomb count for that number.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has only one unflagged adjacent square, then that must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, if a '2' has exactly two unflagged adjacent squares, those must be bombs.\n\nLooking back at the board, I don't see any immediate examples of this.\n\nAlternatively, if a group of squares is constrained by multiple numbers, I might be able to deduce the positions.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should just pick a square that seems safe based on the numbers I see.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 4: position (6,4) is a '1', adjacent to (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\n- (5,4): '.'\n\n- (5,5): '.'\n\n- (6,3): '1'\n\n- (6,5): '.'\n\n- (7,3): '1'\n\n- (7,4): '1'\n\n- (7,5): '1'\n\nSo, the '1' at (6,4) has one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nThis doesn't give me enough information to make a definitive decision.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total number of flags left and see if I can place them in logical positions.\n\nI have 10 flags left and 10 bombs remaining. So, every flag must be on a bomb.\n\nI need to make sure that wherever I place a flag, it doesn't contradict the numbers I see on the board.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to reveal a square that seems safe.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 6: position (4,6) is a dot, which means it's unexplored.\n\nAdjacent to it are (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (3,5): '1'\n\n- (3,6): '.'\n\n- (3,7): '1'\n\n- (4,5): '.'\n\n- (4,7): '1'\n\n- (5,5): '.'\n\n- (5,6): '.'\n\n- (5,7): '.'\n\nThis seems like a relatively safe spot, as it's not adjacent to any higher numbers.\n\nMaybe I can try to reveal (4,6).\n\nBut before doing that, let me check if there's any risk.\n\nThe '1' at (3,5) has one bomb in its adjacent squares, which include (4,5) and (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, the '1' at (3,7) has one bomb in its adjacent squares, which include (4,7) and (4,6).\n\nSo, (4,6) is adjacent to two '1's: (3,5) and (3,7).\n\nIf I reveal (4,6), and it's a bomb, that would satisfy both '1's, but I only have one bomb to place there.\n\nWait, but I have to consider that each '1' can have its bomb in different positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both '1's share the same bomb in (4,6).\n\nBut then, that would mean that (4,6) is a bomb, which would satisfy both '1's.\n\nBut I need to make sure that placing a bomb there doesn't contradict other numbers.\n\nLooking at (4,5), which is adjacent to (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nIf (4,6) is a bomb, then (4,5) would be adjacent to one bomb, so it should be a '1'.\n\nBut (4,5) is currently a dot, meaning unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, (4,7) is adjacent to (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (5,7), (5,8).\n\nIf (4,6) is a bomb, then (4,7) would be adjacent to one bomb, which matches its '1'.\n\nSo, if I place a bomb at (4,6), it seems consistent with the '1's at (3,5) and (3,7), and the '1's at (4,5) and (4,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nLooking at (5,6), which is adjacent to (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7).\n\nIf (4,6) is a bomb, then (5,6) would be adjacent to one bomb, so it should be a '1'.\n\nBut (5,6) is currently a dot, meaning unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) and (5,7) would each be adjacent to one bomb if (4,6) is a bomb.\n\nSo, revealing (4,6) would either confirm it's a bomb or reveal a number.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs, and considering the above, perhaps it's safe to reveal (4,6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag there.\n\nBut if I place a flag at (4,6), I need to ensure that it doesn't contradict other numbers.\n\nGiven that both (3,5) and (3,7) are '1's, and assuming (4,6) is a bomb, that would satisfy both '1's.\n\nThen, for (4,5) and (4,7), which are both dots, they would each be adjacent to one bomb, so they should be '1's.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) would be adjacent to one bomb, so it should be a '1'.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nBut I need to make sure that placing a flag at (4,6) doesn't create conflicts elsewhere.\n\nLooking at (5,5), which is adjacent to (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,5).\n\nIf (4,6) is a bomb, then (5,5) would be adjacent to one bomb, so it should be a '1'.\n\nBut (5,5) is currently a dot, so revealing it would either show a '1' or another number, depending on surrounding bombs.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSimilarly, (5,7) would be adjacent to one bomb if (4,6) is a bomb, so it should be a '1'.\n\nAgain, it's currently a dot.\n\nSo, placing a flag at (4,6) seems consistent with the numbers I have.\n\nGiven that, and considering I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs, perhaps I should place a flag at (4,6).\n\nBut before doing that, let me see if there are other spots where I can place flags with more certainty.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 3: position (8,3) is a '1', adjacent to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (7,2): '1'\n\n- (7,3): '1'\n\n- (7,4): '1'\n\n- (8,2): '1'\n\n- (8,4): '1'\n\n- (9,2): '1'\n\n- (9,3): '1'\n\n- (9,4): '1'\n\nSo, the '1' at (8,3) has one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nThis is another cluster of '1's, which doesn't give me much to work with.\n\nMaybe I should look for a '2' or higher to get more constraints.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 2: position (5,2) is a '2', adjacent to (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (4,1): '.'\n\n- (4,2): '1'\n\n- (4,3): '.'\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\n- (6,1): '.'\n\n- (6,2): '.'\n\n- (6,3): '.'\n\nSo, the '2' at (5,2) has two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at (4,2), which is a '1', adjacent to (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (3,1): '.'\n\n- (3,2): '1'\n\n- (3,3): '_'\n\n- (4,1): '.'\n\n- (4,3): '.'\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\n- (5,2): '2'\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\nSo, the '1' at (4,2) has one bomb in these adjacent squares.\n\nThis is getting too interconnected, and I'm not making progress.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total number of possible bomb placements and see if I can find a unique solution.\n\nBut that seems too time-consuming for this stage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a spot where revealing a square would give me more information without risking a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 5: position (4,5), adjacent to (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nPositions:\n\n- (3,4): '_'\n\n- (3,5): '1'\n\n- (3,6): '.'\n\n- (4,4): '.'\n\n- (4,6): '.'\n\n- (5,4): '.'\n\n- (5,5): '.'\n\n- (5,6): '.'\n\nSo, revealing (4,5) might give me more information.\n\nBut considering that (3,5) is a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent squares, including (4,5) and (4,6).\n\nIf I reveal (4,5) and it's a bomb, that would satisfy the '1' at (3,5).\n\nBut I have to be careful not to hit a bomb.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags left and 10 bombs, perhaps I should consider placing a flag where I think there's a bomb.\n\nLooking back at (4,6), it seems like a likely spot for a bomb, given its adjacency to multiple '1's.\n\nTherefore, I'll decide to place a flag at (4,6).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the adjacency to multiple '1's and the need to satisfy their bomb counts, position (4,6) appears to be a likely location for a bomb. Placing a flag here seems consistent with the current board information.\n\n**MOVE:** 4,6,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . 1 1 . . . .\n2 . . 1 1 1 1 . . . .\n3 . . 1 _ _ 1 1 2 1 1\n4 . . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1\n8 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 1, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. I need to be careful not to step on any bombs while trying to clear the board.\n\nFirst, I should look at the numbers and see what they're telling me about the surrounding squares. Let's start from the top left since that's where the coordinates begin.\n\nLooking at row 0 and row 1, they seem mostly unexplored, with some numbers appearing in row 1 and row 2. Let's focus on row 3, column 3 to column 5, where there are some underscores and numbers.\n\nAt position (3,3), it's an underscore, which means it's an empty revealed space. Adjacent to it are more underscores and some numbers. Wait, position (3,4) is also an underscore, and (3,5) is a '1'. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the board, position (3,3) is a '1', and (3,4) is an underscore, (3,5) is another underscore, and (3,6) is a '1'. Similarly, row 4 has some flags and underscores.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for areas where the numbers clearly indicate the location of bombs.\n\nLet's see, in row 4, column 2, there's a '1', and next to it is a flag at (4,3). So, the '1' has one adjacent bomb, which is already flagged at (4,3). That means the other adjacent squares to (4,2) should be safe to reveal.\n\nLet's list the adjacent squares to (4,2):\n\n- (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\nAmong these, (4,3) is flagged, which accounts for the '1' at (4,2). So, the other squares should be safe.\n\nBut wait, (3,3) is an underscore, which is already revealed, so it's safe. Similarly, (4,1) is an underscore, so safe. (5,2) is an underscore, and (5,3) is an underscore. (3,1) and (3,2) are dots, meaning unexplored.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal (3,1) and (3,2), since the '1' at (4,2) is already accounted for by the flag at (4,3).\n\nBut before I do that, let's check if there are any other constraints or if revealing those squares might uncover more information.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, column 2, there's a '2', with adjacent squares including (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\n\nAt (5,2), '2' indicates two adjacent bombs. Currently, (4,3) is flagged, which is one bomb, so there should be one more bomb among the other adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at the adjacent squares:\n\n- (4,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (4,2): '1'\n\n- (4,3): flag\n\n- (5,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (5,3): underscore (safe)\n\n- (6,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (6,2): '1'\n\n- (6,3): underscore (safe)\n\nSo, among these, the only unaccounted for square is (6,2), which is a '1'. But (6,2) being a '1' means it has one adjacent bomb. Let's see its adjacent squares:\n\n- (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nAmong these, (5,2) is '2' and (7,2) is '1'. But this seems a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should focus on another area.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 2, there's a '1', and adjacent to it are some underscores and dots.\n\nWait, position (7,2): '1'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)\n\nLooking at these:\n\n- (6,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (6,2): '1'\n\n- (6,3): underscore (safe)\n\n- (7,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (7,3): '1'\n\n- (8,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (8,2): '1'\n\n- (8,3): '1'\n\nSo, the '1' at (7,2) should have one adjacent bomb. Among its adjacent squares, all are either underscores or '1's, with no flags. So, perhaps the bomb is in one of the unexplored squares nearby, but I need to be careful.\n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the flags that are already placed. There are 9 flags remaining, but one has already been placed. So, 10 bombs in total, meaning one flag has been used.\n\nLooking at the board, there's only one flagged square at (4,7), which is an 'F'.\n\nBut wait, in the board you provided, there are multiple 'F's. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 4: . . 1 _ _ 1 1 F _ _\n\nSo, position (4,7) is flagged.\n\nAre there any other flags? In row 5: . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nNo flags there. Row 6: . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\nNo flags. Row 7: . . 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1\n\nWait, that's beyond column 9, maybe a typo.\n\nWait, the board is 10 columns, but in the provided board state, some rows have more than 10 columns in the text. I need to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly.\n\nAssuming the board is 10x10, with rows 0 to 9 and columns 0 to 9.\n\nLooking at row 4: . . 1 _ _ _ F _ _ _\n\nSo, position (4,6) is flagged.\n\nIs there another flag elsewhere? In row 7: . . 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1\n\nAgain, seems like 11 columns in the text, but it should be 10.\n\nAssuming the last column is extra, position (7,8) is '1', and (7,9) is '1'.\n\nLooking at row 8: . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nPosition (8,7) is '1', and (8,9) is '.'.\n\nRow 9: . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nPosition (9,2) is '1', and (9,7) is '1'.\n\nSo, only one flag is placed at (4,6).\n\nBut earlier you said flags remaining are 9, and bombs are 10, so one flag has been placed, which matches.\n\nNow, with only one flag placed, I need to be careful about where to place the next one.\n\nLet's look for areas where the numbers indicate that there must be a bomb.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has only one unflagged adjacent square, then that square must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, if a '2' has two unflagged adjacent squares, and only two possible places for bombs, then those must be bombs.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to assume without sufficient evidence.\n\nLet's look at position (5,2), which is a '2'.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (4,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (4,2): '1'\n\n- (4,3): flag (bomb)\n\n- (5,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (5,3): underscore (safe)\n\n- (6,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (6,2): '1'\n\n- (6,3): underscore (safe)\n\nSo, the '2' at (5,2) has one confirmed bomb at (4,3), and needs one more bomb among its adjacent squares.\n\nLooking at the adjacent squares, the only unaccounted for square is (6,2), which is a '1'.\n\nBut (6,2) is a '1', which should have one adjacent bomb. It already has one adjacent bomb at (4,3), but that's two rows up. Wait, is (4,3) adjacent to (6,2)? No, they are diagonally two steps apart.\n\nWait, adjacency in Minesweeper is only immediate neighbors: up, down, left, right, and diagonals.\n\nSo, (6,2) is adjacent to:\n\n- (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nAmong these, (5,2) is '2', which is not a bomb, and (7,2) is '1', which is not a bomb.\n\nWait, no, '2' and '1' are numbers, not bombs. Bombs are flags or revealed bombs.\n\nIn this case, only (4,6) is flagged as a bomb.\n\nSo, for (6,2), which is a '1', it should have one adjacent bomb.\n\nIts adjacent squares:\n\n- (5,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (5,2): '2' (safe)\n\n- (5,3): underscore (safe)\n\n- (6,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (6,3): underscore (safe)\n\n- (7,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (7,2): '1' (safe)\n\n- (7,3): underscore (safe)\n\nWait, none of these are flagged as bombs, but (4,6) is a flag, which is not adjacent to (6,2). So, there must be a bomb somewhere else adjacent to (6,2), but currently, none are flagged.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the '2' at (5,2) needs another bomb in its adjacency, but I can't see where it would be without conflicting with the '1' at (6,2).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the potential moves where I can safely place a flag or reveal a square without risking a bomb.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 3:\n\nPosition (3,3): '1'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (2,2): '1'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): underscore (safe)\n\n- (3,4): underscore (safe)\n\n- (4,2): '1'\n\n- (4,3): flag (bomb)\n\n- (4,4): underscore (safe)\n\nSo, the '1' at (3,3) has one adjacent bomb, which is flagged at (4,3). Therefore, the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nThus, I can safely reveal (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), and (4,4).\n\nBut wait, some of these are already numbers or underscores.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- (2,2): '1' (already revealed)\n\n- (2,3): '1' (already revealed)\n\n- (2,4): '1' (already revealed)\n\n- (3,2): underscore (safe)\n\n- (3,4): underscore (safe)\n\n- (4,2): '1' (already revealed)\n\n- (4,4): underscore (safe)\n\nSo, I can safely reveal (3,2), (3,4), and (4,4), since they are adjacent to (3,3) and the bomb is already accounted for at (4,3).\n\nLet's choose to reveal (3,2).\n\nBut before doing that, let's check if revealing (3,2) might give me more information.\n\nPosition (3,2): underscore, which is already revealed as safe.\n\nWait, it's already revealed, so I don't need to reveal it again.\n\nPerhaps I should look for another '1' or a number that can help me determine the location of a bomb.\n\nLooking at position (4,2): '1'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (3,1): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (3,2): underscore (safe)\n\n- (3,3): '1' (already accounted for)\n\n- (4,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (4,3): flag (bomb)\n\n- (5,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (5,2): '2' (safe)\n\n- (5,3): underscore (safe)\n\nSo, the '1' at (4,2) has one adjacent bomb, which is flagged at (4,3). Therefore, the other adjacent squares should be safe.\n\nThus, I can safely reveal (3,1), since it's the only unexplored square adjacent to (4,2).\n\nSo, my move would be to reveal (3,1).\n\nBut before finalizing that, let's see if there are any other moves that might give me more information.\n\nLooking at position (5,2): '2'\n\nIt has one flagged bomb at (4,3), so it needs one more bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares to (5,2):\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (4,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (4,2): '1' (safe)\n\n- (4,3): flag (bomb)\n\n- (5,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (5,3): underscore (safe)\n\n- (6,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (6,2): '1' (safe)\n\n- (6,3): underscore (safe)\n\nSo, none of these are flags except (4,3), which is already accounted for.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the '2' at (5,2) needs another bomb in a square that isn't adjacent to (5,2), which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted the adjacency.\n\nWait, in Minesweeper, adjacency is only immediate neighbors: up, down, left, right, and diagonals.\n\nSo, for (5,2):\n\n- Up: (4,2)\n\n- Down: (6,2)\n\n- Left: (5,1)\n\n- Right: (5,3)\n\n- Diagonals: (4,1), (4,3), (6,1), (6,3)\n\nAll of these are either underscores or numbers, with (4,3) being flagged.\n\nSo, the '2' needs two bombs in these adjacent squares. One is at (4,3), so one more is needed among the rest.\n\nBut none of the other adjacent squares are flagged, and some are unexplored.\n\nWait, (3,1) is unexplored, but it's not adjacent to (5,2). Wait, no, (3,1) is not adjacent to (5,2). Let's see:\n\nPosition (5,2):\n\n- Adjacent squares: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nAmong these, (4,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (4,2): '1' (safe)\n\n- (4,3): flag (bomb)\n\n- (5,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (5,3): underscore (safe)\n\n- (6,1): underscore (safe)\n\n- (6,2): '1' (safe)\n\n- (6,3): underscore (safe)\n\nSo, all these are safe except for the flag at (4,3). But the '2' at (5,2) needs two bombs, so there must be another bomb somewhere in its adjacency, but all adjacent squares are safe except for (4,3).\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that there might be a bomb in a square that's not directly adjacent to (5,2), but affects the numbers around it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to place a flag in a square that's adjacent to multiple numbered squares.\n\nLooking at position (4,4): underscore (safe)\n\nAdjacent to (3,3): '1' (which has its bomb at (4,3))\n\nAnd adjacent to (5,4): which is '.' (unexplored)\n\nWait, position (5,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\nSimilarly, (6,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\nMaybe I should consider that (5,4) or (6,4) could be bombs.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to be sure.\n\nPerhaps I should make a move to reveal (3,1), as previously thought, since it's adjacent to (4,2), which is a '1' with its bomb already accounted for.\n\nBefore doing that, let's check if revealing (3,1) could potentially uncover more squares and give me more information.\n\nPosition (3,1): '.'\n\nIf I reveal it, and it's a number, it could indicate how many bombs are adjacent to it.\n\nIf it's zero, it would clear out a larger area.\n\nBut since I don't know what's there, I should proceed with caution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag in a square that seems likely to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at position (6,4): '.'\n\nAdjacent to (5,3): underscore (safe)\n\n- (5,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (5,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (6,3): underscore (safe)\n\n- (6,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (7,3): underscore (safe)\n\n- (7,4): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (7,5): '.' (unexplored)\n\nThis seems too vague to determine if there's a bomb there.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the total number of flags remaining: 9, with 10 bombs in total.\n\nOne flag has already been placed at (4,6).\n\nSo, there are 9 flags left to place, and 9 bombs remaining to be flagged.\n\nIf I can find areas where the numbers indicate specific bomb locations, I can place flags there.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find areas where squares are definitely safe, I can reveal them.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should look for a '1' that has only one unflagged adjacent square, and place a flag there.\n\nOr find a '2' that has only two possible squares for bombs.\n\nLooking at position (5,2): '2'\n\nIt has one flagged bomb at (4,3), so it needs one more bomb in its adjacent squares.\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (4,1): safe\n\n- (4,2): safe\n\n- (4,3): bomb\n\n- (5,1): safe\n\n- (5,3): safe\n\n- (6,1): safe\n\n- (6,2): '1'\n\n- (6,3): safe\n\nSo, the only unaccounted for square is (6,2), which is a '1'.\n\nBut (6,2) is a '1', which should have one adjacent bomb.\n\nIf I flag (6,2) as a bomb, does that satisfy both the '2' at (5,2) and the '1' at (6,2)?\n\nWait, no, because if (6,2) is a bomb, then the '1' at (6,2) would have its bomb accounted for, and the '2' at (5,2) would have its second bomb at (6,2).\n\nBut then, the '1' at (6,2) would have only one adjacent bomb, which is at (6,2) itself, but that doesn't make sense because a square can't be its own adjacent bomb.\n\nWait, no, a bomb can't be in the same square as a number.\n\nSo, perhaps (6,2) cannot be a bomb.\n\nBut then, where is the second bomb for the '2' at (5,2)?\n\nLooking at the adjacent squares again:\n\n- (4,1): safe\n\n- (4,2): safe\n\n- (4,3): bomb\n\n- (5,1): safe\n\n- (5,3): safe\n\n- (6,1): safe\n\n- (6,2): '1'\n\n- (6,3): safe\n\nSo, perhaps the second bomb for the '2' at (5,2) is in (6,2), but (6,2) is a '1', which should have only one adjacent bomb.\n\nIf (6,2) is a bomb, then it would satisfy the '2' at (5,2), but then the '1' at (6,2) would have more than one adjacent bomb, which is invalid.\n\nBecause the '1' at (6,2) would have the bomb at (6,2) and possibly others, but it's only supposed to have one adjacent bomb.\n\nWait, no, a number indicates the number of adjacent bombs, not including itself.\n\nSo, if (6,2) is a bomb, then the '1' at (6,2) would have one adjacent bomb, which is at (6,2), but that doesn't make sense because the '1' counts the adjacent bombs, not including itself.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to consider that (6,2) cannot be a bomb, and that there's an error in my earlier assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different area of the board where I can make a safer move.\n\nLooking back at row 3, column 3:\n\nPosition (3,3): '1'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (2,2): '1'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (2,4): '1'\n\n- (3,2): safe\n\n- (3,4): safe\n\n- (4,2): '1'\n\n- (4,3): bomb\n\n- (4,4): safe\n\nSo, all adjacent squares are safe except for the flagged bomb at (4,3).\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal any unexplored squares adjacent to these safe squares.\n\nLooking at position (2,2): '1'\n\nAdjacent squares:\n\n- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (1,1): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (1,2): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (1,3): '1'\n\n- (2,1): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (3,1): '.' (unexplored)\n\n- (3,2): safe\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\nSo, the '1' at (2,2) has one adjacent bomb, which could be in any of the unexplored squares.\n\nThis doesn't give me enough information to place a flag yet.\n\nPerhaps I should consider revealing (1,3), which is a '1', but it's already a number, so it's safe.\n\nWait, no, position (1,3) is '1', which is already revealed.\n\nWait, in row 1:\n\nRow 1: . . . . 1 1 . . . .\n\nSo, position (1,4): '1', and (1,5): '1'.\n\nSimilarly, position (2,4): '1', and (2,5): '1'.\n\nThis seems like a pattern, but I'm not sure how to use it.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nGiven the confusion in earlier steps, perhaps the safest move is to reveal a square that is adjacent to a number with its bombs already accounted for.\n\nLooking back at position (4,2): '1'\n\nWith the bomb at (4,3), the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal (3,1), which is adjacent to (4,2).\n\nSo, my move is to reveal (3,1).\n\n**Final Solution**\nTo proceed in this Minesweeper game, we need to make a move that is safe based on the current state of the board. Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the next move:\n\n1. **Identify Safe Areas:**\n   - Look for numbers where the required number of adjacent bombs is already flagged.\n   - For example, a '1' with one adjacent flag indicates that the other adjacent squares are safe.\n\n2. **Analyze Specific Positions:**\n   - Examine position (4,2), which is a '1'.\n   - Adjacent to (4,2) are positions: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n   - Among these, (4,3) is flagged as a bomb, satisfying the '1' at (4,2).\n\n3. **Determine Safe Squares:**\n   - Since the '1' at (4,2) has its bomb accounted for at (4,3), the other adjacent squares are safe to reveal.\n   - These safe squares include (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3).\n\n4. **Choose a Safe Move:**\n   - Select one of these safe squares to reveal. For this step, we'll choose (3,1).\n\n**Final Solution Code**\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: The '1' at (4,2) has its adjacent bomb accounted for at (4,3), so adjacent squares like (3,1) are safe to reveal.\nMOVE: 3,1,false\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Position (4,2):** This is a '1', indicating one adjacent bomb.\n- **Flagged Bomb:** Position (4,3) is flagged, accounting for the '1' at (4,2).\n- **Safe Squares:** All other squares adjacent to (4,2) are safe to reveal.\n- **Next Move:** Reveal position (3,1) as it is adjacent to (4,2) and is safe based on the above analysis.", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . 1 1 . . . .\n2 . . 1 1 1 1 . . . .\n3 . . 1 _ _ 1 1 2 1 1\n4 . . 1 _ _ _ F _ _ _\n5 . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1\n8 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 3, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. I need to be careful not to step on any bombs while trying to clear the board.\n\nFirst, I should look at the areas where I have some numbers revealed and see if I can deduce the positions of the bombs based on those numbers. Let's start from the top-left corner and work our way across.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n\n1 _ _ 1 . 1 1 . . . .\n\n2 _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . . .\n\n3 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 2 1 1\n\n4 2 . 1 _ _ _ F _ _ _\n\n5 . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n\n7 . . 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1\n\n8 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n\nOkay, so in row 0, column 2, there's a '1'. That means there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,1)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,3)\n\nBut, (0,1) is '_', which is a revealed empty space, so it can't be a bomb. Similarly, (1,2) is a '1', which is also a revealed number, so it can't be a bomb. So, the possible bomb locations are (0,3), (1,1), and (1,3).\n\nNow, looking at (1,3), it's a '.', which is unexplored. Similarly, (1,1) is '_', which is safe. So, only (0,3) and (1,3) could be bombs. But, since the number is '1', only one of these two can be a bomb.\n\nBut, let's see if we can get more information from other squares.\n\nMoving to row 1, column 2, there's another '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (0,1)\n\n- (0,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\nWe already know that (0,2) is '1', (1,2) is '1', and (2,2) is '1'. These are all revealed numbers, so they can't be bombs. (0,1) and (1,1) are '_', safe. So, possible bomb locations are (0,3), (1,3), (2,1), and (2,3).\n\nBut, (0,3) and (1,3) are already candidates from the previous square. Let's see what else we can find.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 2, which is '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (3,3)\n\nAgain, (1,2) and (2,2) are '1's, safe. (1,1) and (2,1) are '_', safe. So, possible bomb locations are (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), and (3,3).\n\nWait a minute, (1,3) keeps appearing as a possible bomb location in multiple '1's. Maybe it's a bomb.\n\nBut let's check further.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0, which is '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (3,0)\n\nBut (2,0) is '_', safe. (2,1) is '1', safe. (3,1) is '_', safe. So, only (3,0) could be a bomb, but that would contradict other numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a better approach.\n\nLet me look for areas where I can confirm the positions of bombs.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 2, which is '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (5,3)\n\nNow, (3,2) is '1', safe. (4,2) is '.', unexplored. (3,1) is '1', safe. (3,3) is '1', safe. (5,2) is '2', which is a number, safe. So, possible bomb locations are (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), and (5,3).\n\nBut, in row 4, column 0, there's a '2'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (3,0)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (5,0)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (6,0)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (7,0)\n\nBut, (3,1) is '1', safe. (4,1) could be a bomb, as per the previous square. (5,1) could be a bomb. (3,0) is '_', safe. So, possible bomb locations are (4,1), (5,1), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (7,0).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a place where the number of possible bomb locations matches the number indicated.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 3, which is '_'. Wait, it's actually '1' in row 3, column 3.\n\nWait, no, in row 3, column 3, it's '_', but looking back, it's actually '1'.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\n3 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 2 1 1\n\nSo, row 3, columns 0 to 9: 1,1,1,_ _,1,1,2,1,1\n\nHmm, so column 3 and 4 are '_'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look more carefully.\n\nLet me try to look for a row or column with clear indications.\n\nLooking at row 7:\n\n7 . . 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1\n\nSo, columns 2 to 6 are 1,1,1,'_', '_', and then columns 7 to 9 are 1,1,1.\n\nThis seems interesting. The middle part is unexplored, but surrounded by '1's.\n\nWait, but the '1's indicate that there's only one bomb adjacent to each of them.\n\nPerhaps I can use that to figure out the positions.\n\nLet me consider the middle part of the board.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 4, which is '_'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\nBut, (3,4) is '_', (3,5) is '_', (4,3) is '_', (4,5) is '_', (5,3) is '_', (5,4) is 'F', which is flagged, and (5,5) is '_'.\n\nWait, but (4,4) is '.', unexplored.\n\nWait, no, in row 4, column 4 is '_', but looking back, it's actually '.'.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\n4 2 . 1 _ _ _ F _ _ _\n\nSo, row 4, columns 0 to 9: 2,'.',1,'_','_','_','F','_','_','_'\n\nOkay, so column 4 is '_', which is an unexplored space.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the flagged space in row 4, column 6, which is 'F'.\n\nThat means there's a bomb there.\n\nSo, the '2' in row 4, column 0, has adjacent squares:\n\n- (3,0)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (5,0)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (6,0)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (7,0)\n\nBut, (3,1) is '1', safe. (4,1) is '.', unexplored. (5,1) is '2', safe. (3,0) is '1', safe. (5,0) is '.', unexplored. (6,0) is '.', unexplored. (6,1) is '.', unexplored. (7,0) is '.', unexplored.\n\nBut, the '2' means there are exactly two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut, we have a flag in (4,6), which is outside this area, so it doesn't directly affect this '2'.\n\nWait, no, (4,6) is 'F', which is a flag, meaning there's a bomb there.\n\nBut, that's not adjacent to (4,0), which is the '2'. The adjacent squares for (4,0) are only those I listed earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 2, which is '2'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,3)\n\nNow, (4,2) is '.', unexplored. (4,3) is '_', safe. (5,3) is '_', safe. (6,2) is '.', unexplored. (6,3) is '.', unexplored. (5,1) is '.', unexplored. (4,1) is '.', unexplored. (6,1) is '.', unexplored.\n\nThe '2' means there are exactly two bombs in these adjacent squares.\n\nBut, I don't have any flags placed in these adjacent squares yet, except that there's a flag in (4,6), which is not adjacent to this '2'.\n\nSo, I need to find two bomb locations among these adjacent squares.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a square that is guaranteed to be safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 4, which is '1'. Its adjacent squares are:\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (7,3)\n\n- (7,4)\n\n- (7,5)\n\nNow, (5,4) is 'F', which is a flag, so there's a bomb there. (5,3) is '_', safe. (5,5) is '_', safe. (6,3) is '.', unexplored. (6,5) is '.', unexplored. (7,3) is '.', unexplored. (7,4) is '1', safe. (7,5) is '1', safe.\n\nSo, the '1' in (6,4) already has one adjacent bomb, which is (5,4). Therefore, there should be no more bombs adjacent to it.\n\nTherefore, squares (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), and (7,5) are all safe to reveal.\n\nWait, but (7,4) is '1', which is already revealed.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), and (7,5).\n\nBut, I need to choose one to reveal next.\n\nLet's pick (6,3).\n\nSo, my move would be to reveal (6,3).\n\nBut, before I do that, I should check if there's any conflict with existing flags.\n\nLooking back, in row 4, column 6, there's a flag, but that's not adjacent to (6,3).\n\nSo, it should be safe.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's check the adjacent squares of (6,3):\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (7,2)\n\n- (7,3)\n\n- (7,4)\n\n- (8,3)\n\nNow, (5,3) is '_', safe. (5,4) is 'F', bomb. (6,4) is '1', safe. (7,3) is '.', unexplored. (7,4) is '1', safe. (5,2) is '.', unexplored. (7,2) is '.', unexplored. (8,3) is '.', unexplored.\n\nThe '1' in (6,4) already has one adjacent bomb, which is (5,4). So, no more bombs can be adjacent to it, which includes (6,3) and (6,5).\n\nTherefore, (6,3) should be safe to reveal.\n\nSo, I'll go ahead and reveal (6,3).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed safely in this Minesweeper game, we need to make a move that minimizes risk based on the current board state. After analyzing the board, the best next move is to reveal the square at position (6,3). This decision is supported by the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Safety Confirmation**: The square at (6,3) is adjacent to a '1' at (6,4), which already has one flagged bomb adjacent to it (at (5,4)). Therefore, no additional bombs can be adjacent to (6,4), making (6,3) safe to reveal.\n\n2. **Minimizing Risk**: By choosing (6,3), we are selecting a square that is guaranteed to be safe based on the current flag placements and revealed numbers.\n\n3. **Progression**: Revealing (6,3) will provide more information about the surrounding squares, potentially leading to the safe revelation of additional squares.\n\nThus, the next move should be to reveal the square at (6,3).\n\n**MOVE: 6,3,false**", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n1 _ _ 1 . 1 1 . . . .\n2 _ _ 1 1 1 1 . . . .\n3 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 2 1 1\n4 2 . 1 _ _ _ F _ _ _\n5 . . 2 1 1 _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n7 . . 1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1\n8 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": false}
