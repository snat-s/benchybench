This means there must be exactly one more bomb among the remaining adjacent cells: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nHowever, cell (4,4) is already a '2', which we'll analyze next.\n\n#### **Cell (5,5): Number '2'**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n```\n(4,4) (4,5) (4,6)\n(5,4)      (5,6)\n(6,4) (6,5) (6,6)\n```\n\nCell (6,5) is flagged (`F`), so one bomb is already accounted for. Thus, there must be exactly one more bomb among the remaining adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6).\n\n#### **Cell (5,6): Number '3'**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n```\n(4,5) (4,6) (4,7)\n(5,5)      (5,7)\n(6,5) (6,6) (6,7)\n```\n\nCell (6,5) is flagged (`F`), accounting for one bomb. Therefore, there must be exactly two more bombs among the remaining adjacent cells: (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,6), (6,7).\n\n#### **Cell (6,4): Number '1'**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n```\n(5,3) (5,4) (5,5)\n(6,3)      (6,5)\n(7,3) (7,4) (7,5)\n```\n\nCell (6,5) is flagged (`F`), which satisfies the '1' count. Therefore, no additional bombs can be adjacent to cell (6,4). This means cells (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5) are safe to reveal.\n\n#### **Cell (6,5): Flagged ('F')**\n\nThis cell is already flagged, indicating a presumed bomb. It's important to verify if this flag is correctly placed by checking the adjacent numbers.\n\n### **Cross-Verification of Flagged Cells**\n\nLet's ensure that the flag at (6,5) is correctly placed by verifying it against adjacent numbers.\n\n**Cell (5,4): Number '2'**\n\nAdjacent cells: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nFlag at (6,5) accounts for one bomb. Therefore, exactly one more bomb must be among the remaining cells.\n\n**Cell (5,5): Number '2'**\n\nAdjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nFlag at (6,5) accounts for one bomb.

Therefore, exactly two more bombs must be among the remaining cells.\n\n**Cell (6,4): Number '1'**\n\nAdjacent cells: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5).\n\nFlag at (6,5) satisfies the '1' count. Therefore, no additional bombs can be adjacent to cell (6,4).\n\nBased on this verification, the flag at (6,5) is correctly placed as it aligns with the adjacent numbers.\n\n### **Identifying Safe Moves**\n\nNow, let's identify cells that can be safely revealed based on the current information.\n\n#### **Safe Cells Adjacent to Cell (6,4): Number '1'**\n\nSince cell (6,4) has exactly one adjacent bomb, which is already flagged at (6,5), all other adjacent cells must be safe. These cells are:\n\n- (5,3)\n- (5,4)\n- (5,5)\n- (6,3)\n- (7,3)\n- (7,4)\n- (7,5)\n\n**Decision:** Reveal these cells to uncover safe spaces.\n\n### **Determining the Next Move**\n\nAmong the safe cells identified, let's choose the one that provides the most information or is strategically advantageous.\n\n**Cell (5,5):** Adjacent to multiple numbers (2,2,3), revealing it could provide valuable information about surrounding bombs.\n\n**Cell (5,3):** Also adjacent to multiple numbers, but slightly less central compared to (5,5).\n\n**Decision:** Reveal cell (5,5) as it is central and adjacent to several numbers, which could help in further deductions.\n\n### **Finalizing the Move**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Cell (6,4) has a number '1' with the adjacent cell (6,5) already flagged as a bomb. Therefore, all other cells adjacent to (6,4) must be safe. Revealing cell (5,5) will provide more information about the surrounding bombs, aiding in further deductions.\n\n**MOVE:** 5,5,false\n\nThis move will reveal the cell at row 5, column 5, without placing a flag, as it is determined to be safe based on the current board state and the rules of Minesweeper.", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . 2 . . . . .\n5 . . . . 2 2 3 . . .\n6 . . . . 1 1 2 F . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Now, let's see what impact this has on adjacent numbers.\n\n**Adjacent to (6,7):**\n- (5,6), (5,7)\n- (6,6)\n- (7,6), (7,7)\n\n#### **Analyzing (5,6): `3`**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n- (5,5), (5,7)\n- (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nThere's **1 flag** at (6,7).

Let's try a different approach.\n\n### **Focusing on Position (6,6): `2` with 1 Flag**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n- (6,5), (6,7)\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\nThere's **1 flag** at (6,7), so we need **1 more bomb** among:\n- (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n- (6,5)\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\nLet's see if we can narrow this down.\n\n#### **Position (5,6): `3`**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n- (5,5), (5,7)\n- (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nThere's **1 flag** at (6,7), so we need **2 more bombs** among:\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n- (5,5), (5,7)\n- (6,5), (6,6)\n\nLooking at (4,5), (4,6), (4,7):\n\nThese squares are unexplored, so they could potentially be bombs.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) and (5,7) are unexplored.\n\n(6,5) is adjacent to (6,5) which shows `1`. Let's see.\n\n#### **Position (6,5): `1`**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n- (6,4), (6,6)\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\nThere are no flags adjacent to (6,5), so **1 bomb** must be among these squares.\n\nGiven that (5,5) is adjacent to both (5,5) and (6,5), and (5,5) needs **2 bombs**, it's likely that (5,5) is a bomb.\n\nIf (5,5) is a bomb, then for (6,5), which shows `1`, the bomb at (5,5) would satisfy that.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that (5,5) is a bomb.\n\n### **Placing a Flag at (5,5)**\n\nSince we've deduced that (5,5) is a bomb, it's safe to place a flag there.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the numbers at (5,5) and (6,5), it's clear that (5,5) must be a bomb to satisfy both the `2` at (5,5) and the `1` at (6,5).\n\n**MOVE:** 5,5,true\n\n### **Updating the Board After Placing the Flag**\n\nAfter placing the flag at (5,5), let's update our analysis.\n\n#### **Position (5,5): Flag**\n\nNow, this affects the adjacent numbers:\n\n**Adjacent to (5,5):**\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n- (5,4), (5,6)\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n#### **Analyzing (5,4): `2`**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n- (5,3), (5,5)\n- (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nThere's **1 flag** at (5,5). Therefore, we need **1 more bomb** among:\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n- (5,3)\n- (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\n#### **Analyzing (5,6): `3`**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n- (5,5), (5,7)\n- (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nThere's **1 flag** at (5,5) and **1 flag** at (6,7). Therefore, we need **1 more bomb** among:\n- (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n- (5,7)\n- (6,5), (6,6)\n\n#### **Analyzing (6,5): `1`**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n- (6,4), (6,6)\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\nThere's **1 flag** at (5,5). Therefore, there are **0 more bombs** needed among:\n- (5,4), (5,6)\n- (6,4), (6,6)\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\nThis means these squares are safe to reveal.\n\n### **Revealing Safe Squares**\n\nFrom the above analysis, the squares adjacent to (6,5) that are safe to reveal are:\n\n- (5,4), (5,6)\n- (6,4), (6,6)\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\nHowever, let's cross-reference with other numbers to ensure they don't indicate bombs in these positions.\n\n#### **Checking (5,4): `2`**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n- (5,3), (5,5)\n- (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nThere's **1 flag** at (5,5), so we need **1 more bomb** among:\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n- (5,3)\n- (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nIf we reveal (6,4) and it's safe, it helps reduce uncertainty.\n\n#### **Checking (6,6): `2`**\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n- (6,5), (6,7)\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\nThere's **1 flag** at (5,5) and **1 flag** at (6,7). Therefore, **0 more bombs** are needed among:\n- (5,6), (5,7)\n- (6,5)\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\nThis means these squares are safe to reveal.\n\n### **Making the Next Move**\n\nBased on this analysis, the safest move is to reveal one of the squares that we've deduced must be safe.\n\nLet's choose (6,4) to reveal.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Position (6,5) shows `1`, and there's already a flag at (5,5). Therefore, all other adjacent squares to (6,5) must be safe. Revealing (6,4) will help uncover more information about the board.\n\n**MOVE:** 6,4,false\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each revealed number and considering the existing flags, I was able to deduce the location of a bomb at (5,5) and identify safe squares to reveal. Placing the flag at (5,5) and revealing (6,4) are logical next steps that will provide more information to continue solving the Minesweeper puzzle safely.\n\n---\n\n**FINAL ANSWER:**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the numbers at (5,5) and (6,5), it's clear that (5,5) must be a bomb to satisfy both the `2` at (5,5) and the `1` at (6,5).

Considering the revealed '1' at (6,4):\n   - It has only one adjacent unexplored tile at (6,5)\n   - Since it's a '1' and there are no adjacent flags, (6,5) must be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, we should flag the tile at (6,5) as it must contain a bomb based on the '1' at (6,4).\n\nMOVE: 6,5,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . 2 . . . . .\n5 . . . . 2 2 3 . . .\n6 . . . . 1 1 2 F . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

All numbers align with the adjacent flags.\n\n3. **Remaining flags vs bombs:**\n   - Flags remaining: 8\n   - Bombs: 10\n   - Flags already placed: 2 (at (6,5) and (6,7))\n\n4. **Identify safe moves:**\n   - At (6,4): Value = 1, Adjacent flags: 1 (at (6,5)). This means there are no other bombs adjacent to (6,4). So, we can safely reveal the adjacent unexplored tiles: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5).\n   - Among these, (6,5) is already flagged, so we can reveal the others.\n\n5. **Choose the next move:**\n   - Let's reveal (5,3), as it is adjacent to (6,4) and safe to reveal.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The tile at (6,4) has a value of 1 and already has one adjacent flag at (6,5).
