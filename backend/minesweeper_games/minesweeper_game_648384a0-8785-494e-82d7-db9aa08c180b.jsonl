Since we know there exists a flag, revealing adjacent tiles is necessary.\n2. Because of the limitations of the adjacent bombs and revealed tiles, revealing is necessary at (5,5) adjacent to the revealed **2** tile to explore further options without conflicts.\n\n### Next Move:\nGiven the above analysis, my next move would be to reveal tile **(5,5)**.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (5,5) is important to explore the proximity of the numbered tiles, particularly the revealed **2** at (5,6), while also checking for any further adjacent bombs.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 2 . . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 2 . . . .\n4 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n5 . . 1 _ _ 1 F 2 2 1\n6 1 1 1 F _ _ F _ _ _\n7 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1\n8 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n9 . . 1 _ _ 1 . . . .", "sucess": true}

Could only have one more bomb nearby.\n     - (4,0), (4,1), (4,2): Each show one bomb adjacent; need to consider surrounding unexplored spaces.\n\n2. **Key Areas:**\n   - (5,6) has a flag placed already. It can't be adjacent to any more bombs (disturbed from (5,5) and can only relate to the tiles around it), meaning it must not connect to (3,5).\n   - The flagged tiles at (6,3) and (6,6) need to be assessed against revealed numbers like the 2 at (7,6), and others near (8,1).\n\n### Move Consideration:\nCurrently, there are several spaces that need to be revealed. The most strategic would involve revealing positions that are not flagged yet but show no immediate conflict with numbers.\n\n**Focusing on the revealed numbers:**\n- We can safely reveal the tile at (3,0):\n   - It's an unexplored tile adjacent to revealed bombs and numbers.\n   - Consider revealing as it doesn't create conflicts and is safe due to neighboring numbers.\n\n### Conclusion:\nI will **reveal** the tile at (3,0) as there are sufficient checks ensuring that it won\u2019t reveal a bomb and should provide further insight into surrounding tiles.\n\n**Next Move:**\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal the tile at (3,0) since it's adjacent to safe areas and there's no risk of a bomb based on current knowledge.\nMOVE: 3,0,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 2 . . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 2 . . . .\n4 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n5 . . 1 _ _ 1 F 2 2 1\n6 1 1 1 F _ _ F _ _ _\n7 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1\n8 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n9 . . 1 _ _ 1 . . . .", "sucess": true}

Therefore, one more bomb must be adjacent to (5, 6).\n   - The (5, 7) and (6, 6) are unexplored; one of these must be a bomb.\n\n2. **Row 6 (x=6)**:\n   - The cell (6, 5) shows '1', indicating that there is exactly 1 adjacent bomb; it cannot have more than 1 adjacent bomb because of this.\n   - The flags present: (6, 3) and (6, 4) are unconfirmed. \n\n3. **Row 4 (x=4)**:\n   - Checking (4, 1) indicates that this cell has three adjacent bombs. If (5, 0) and (5, 1) are not bombs, they must be flagged as bombs.\n\n\n### Further Analysis:\n- The revealed '1' at (6,5) cannot have flags surrounding it as there\u2019s only 1. If (6, 6) is a bomb, that confirms the number '1' and we wouldn\u2019t need to flag (5,6).\n\n### Deciding the Moves:\nTo reflect on the findings, I'll first select:\n- **MOVE**: I will flag (6, 6) because this square needs to account for adjacent bombs based on the revealed numbers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nKeep track of numbers to ensure conformity with revealed tiles and maintain a well-structured game board.\n\n### Final Move:\nEXPLANATION: Flagging (6, 6) ensures we respect the adjacent bomb count based on surrounding numbers.\nMOVE: 6,6,true", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 2 . . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 2 . . . .\n4 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n5 . . 1 _ _ 1 F 2 2 1\n6 1 1 1 F _ _ F _ _ _\n7 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1\n8 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n9 . . 1 _ _ 1 . . . .", "sucess": true}

This tile requires 1 bomb.\n   - For the number `1` at (4,0), it has no flags adjacent.\n   - For the number `1` at (4,1), it has no flags adjacent.\n   - For the number `1` at (5,2), it has 1 adjacent flag (at (6,0)). This means there can only be one bomb in the adjacent tiles (5,1) and (6,1).\n   - For the number `2` at (1,4), it has 1 flag adjacent (at (6,0)). There needs to be another bomb, implying there are at least two bombs in the adjacent tiles.\n   - The `2` at (5,7) has 1 flag adjacent (at (6,0)), indicating there needs to be one more bomb in the adjacent unseen spaces.\n   - The `2` at (7,6) has no flags adjacent.\n\n2. **Identifying Conflicts:**\n   - The `1` at (0,3) and the `1` at (0,0) do not have conflicts.\n   - The `1` at (5,2) and `1` at (5,7) are safe with 1 adjacent flag each, meaning they could be calling for potential bombs in unseen spaces nearby (5,1), (6,1), (6,2).\n\n3. **Remaining Flags vs. Bombs:**\n   - There are 8 flags remaining and 10 bombs in the game. Right now, I have confirmed at least one bomb from (5,2), and analyzing further could reveal more potential flags but placing a flag at the present will assure safety for revealing more spaces.\n\n4. **Deciding on the Next Move:**\n   - I will reveal tile (0,4) since it is an unexplored space adjacent to a `1` which currently has no adjacent flags, thus remains a safe move.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing the tile (0,4) seems like a straightforward move as it does not conflict with the existing numbers or adjacent flags, allowing for possible further exploration of the board without immediate risk.\nMOVE: 0,4,false", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 1 2 . . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 2 . . . .\n4 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n5 . . 1 _ _ 1 F 2 2 1\n6 1 1 1 F _ _ _ _ _ _\n7 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 2 1 1\n8 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n9 . . 1 _ _ 1 . . . .", "sucess": false}
