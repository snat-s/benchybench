For instance, revealing a tile next to a '1' could help identify where a bomb is located if there's only one possible position left for a bomb adjacent to that '1'. Considering the board's current state and the goal of maximizing information gain while minimizing risk, a good move would be to reveal a tile that is adjacent to a revealed number and has the potential to give us more insight into the board's layout.\n\nMOVE: 4,1,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . 1 _ _\n1 2 2 2 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ 1 . . 2 _ _\n3 1 1 _ _ 1 . . 1 _ _\n4 . 1 _ 1 2 3 2 1 _ _\n5 1 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _ _\n6 _ _ 1 . 3 2 _ _ _ _\n7 _ _ 1 2 . 1 _ _ _ _\n8 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
