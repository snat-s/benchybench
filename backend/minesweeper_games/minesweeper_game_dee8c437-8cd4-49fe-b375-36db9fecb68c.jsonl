The game is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining. Since the entire board is hidden, there's no information to go on. The first move in Minesweeper is usually a safe click. Typically, players start by clicking the center or a corner, but since all squares are equally likely to be safe at the beginning, maybe the best bet is to click a corner. Wait, but in Minesweeper, the first click is always safe, right? So no matter where I click, it won't be a bomb. So maybe I should click the center to maximize the chance of opening up a larger area. Wait, but in some versions, the first click might generate the bombs after the first move, ensuring that the first click is safe. So in this case, since the board is all dots, the first move is safe. So I can choose any square. Let's pick the middle, maybe (5,5). That way, when revealed, it might show a number that gives information about surrounding squares. Alternatively, maybe a corner like (0,0) to start. But in standard Minesweeper strategy, starting in the middle can open up more space. Hmm. But since the board is 10x10 and there are 10 bombs, the density is low. So the first click is safe. Let's go with (5,5) and reveal it. That's the best move here.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The entire board is unexplored. The first move in Minesweeper is always safe.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 3, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at the Minesweeper board provided. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining. The current state shows some revealed numbers in the lower middle area. Let me focus on those to find the next move.\n\nStarting with the revealed numbers. At position (4,4) there's a 2. The cells around it might have bombs. Let's check the adjacent cells. The cells around (4,4) are positions (3,3) to (5,5), except (4,4) itself. But since the board is mostly unexplored except for rows 4,5,6, maybe there are some flags already placed? Wait, looking at the board state, there are no F symbols shown. So no flags are placed yet. That means the 2 at (4,4) must have two bombs in its adjacent cells. Let's see which of those are still unexplored.\n\nLooking at the cells around (4,4). The cells to the top-left, top, top-right, left, right, bottom-left, bottom, bottom-right. Let's list them:\n\nRow 3, columns 3,4,5: all are dots (unexplored).\nRow 4, columns 3 and 5: dots. Column 4 is the 2.\nRow 5, columns 3,4,5: (5,3) is dot, (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1.\n\nWait, the cell (5,4) is a 1. So that 1 must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Let's check its adjacent cells. The cells around (5,4) would include (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). But (4,4) is a 2, (4,5) is a 1, (5,5) is a 1, (6,4) is a 3, (6,5) is a 3. So the 1 at (5,4) has some revealed numbers around it. Let's see how many bombs are already accounted for here.\n\nBut wait, since there are no flags yet, the 1 at (5,4) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent unexplored cells. Let's look at the adjacent cells of (5,4):\n\n- (4,3): unexplored (dot)\n- (4,4): 2 (already revealed)\n- (4,5): 1 (revealed)\n- (5,3): dot\n- (5,5): 1 (revealed)\n- (6,3): dot\n- (6,4): 3 (revealed)\n- (6,5): 3 (revealed)\n\nSo the only unexplored cells adjacent to (5,4) are (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). The 1 at (5,4) needs exactly one bomb among these three cells. But how does that relate to the 3s at (6,4) and (6,5)?\n\nLooking at (6,4) which is a 3. The cells around (6,4) would include (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The 3 here indicates three bombs in those cells. But again, no flags are present. So the three bombs must be in the unexplored cells around (6,4). Let's check which of those are unexplored.\n\nThe adjacent cells to (6,4) are:\n\n- (5,3): dot\n- (5,4): 1 (revealed)\n- (5,5): 1 (revealed)\n- (6,3): dot\n- (6,5): 3 (revealed)\n- (7,3): dot\n- (7,4): dot\n- (7,5): dot\n\nSo the 3 at (6,4) requires three bombs in the cells (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But since (5,4) is a 1, which requires one bomb in (5,3), (6,3), or (6,3) (wait, (5,3), (5,4) is 1's adjacent cells). Wait, the 1 at (5,4) has three unexplored cells: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). But the 3 at (6,4) has (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5) as unexplored. Let's see if there's overlap here.\n\nIf the 1 at (5,4) requires one bomb in (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), and the 3 at (6,4) requires three bombs in (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), then perhaps there's a way to deduce where the bombs are.\n\nBut let's also look at the 3 at (6,5). The cells around (6,5) would be (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). But (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (6,4) is 3, and the rest are dots. So the 3 at (6,5) needs three bombs in the adjacent cells. The adjacent unexplored cells here are (5,6), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). But (5,6) is a dot, (6,6) is a dot, and the others are dots. So that's another area to consider.\n\nBut maybe focusing on the 3s at (6,4) and (6,5) can help. Let's see. The 3 at (6,4) has three bombs in its adjacent cells. Let's consider the cells (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The 3 at (6,5) has three bombs in (5,6), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). So the cells (7,4), (7,5) are common to both. If those cells have bombs, they would contribute to both the 3s at (6,4) and (6,5). But how does that affect the count?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 at (6,4) and the 3 at (6,5) share some bomb positions. Let's think. Suppose (7,4) and (7,5) each have a bomb. Then each of those would count towards both 3s. But each 3 needs three bombs. So if (7,4) and (7,5) are bombs, then for (6,4), the remaining bombs would need to be in (5,3), (6,3), (7,3). For (6,5), the remaining bombs would be in (5,6), (6,6), (7,6). But that's a lot of bombs. But since there are only 10 bombs total, maybe this is possible. But perhaps there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLooking back at the 2 at (4,4). Since it's a 2, there must be two bombs adjacent. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). But (5,4) is a 1, (5,5) is a 1, (4,5) is a 1. So the 2 at (4,4) must have two bombs in the remaining cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (5,3). Let's see how that interacts with other numbers.\n\nThe 1 at (4,5) (row 4, column 5) has adjacent cells. Let's check those. The cells around (4,5) are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). The 1 here means exactly one bomb in those cells. But (4,4) is a 2, (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1, and the rest are dots. So the bomb must be in one of the unexplored cells: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). But how does that relate to the 2 at (4,4)?\n\nIf the 2 at (4,4) has two bombs in its adjacent cells, and the 1 at (4,5) has one bomb in its adjacent cells, perhaps there's an overlap. For example, if (3,5) is a bomb, it would count towards both the 2 at (4,4) and the 1 at (4,5). But then the 2 at (4,4) would need one more bomb in its other cells. Let's see.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's look for cells that can be safely revealed based on existing numbers.\n\nLooking at the 1 at (5,5). The cells around (5,5) are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). The 1 here means exactly one bomb in those cells. The revealed cells are (4,4)=2, (4,5)=1, (5,4)=1, (6,4)=3, (6,5)=3. The unexplored cells are (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). So the bomb must be in one of those three. But how does that interact with the 3s at (6,4) and (6,5)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1 at (5,5) has a bomb in (4,6), (5,6), or (6,6). Let's see. If (5,6) is a bomb, then that would contribute to the 3 at (6,5). But the 3 at (6,5) needs three bombs. If (5,6) is a bomb, then the remaining two bombs would need to be in (6,6) and (7,5) or others. But this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, if a number has all its required bombs already flagged, then the remaining adjacent cells can be safely revealed. But since there are no flags yet, that's not applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, look for cells where the number of adjacent unexplored cells equals the number of bombs needed. For example, if a cell with a 1 has exactly one unexplored cell adjacent, then that cell must be a bomb. But again, without flags, maybe we can find such a case.\n\nLooking at the 3 at (6,4). It has three bombs needed. The adjacent unexplored cells are (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). Let's count how many of these are unexplored. All are dots. So five cells. The 3 requires three bombs here. But how can we determine which ones?\n\nWait, maybe the 1 at (5,4) can help. The 1 at (5,4) has three unexplored cells: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). It needs exactly one bomb there. Let's say that one of those is a bomb. Then, the 3 at (6,4) would need three bombs in (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). If (5,3) or (6,3) is a bomb (as per the 1 at (5,4)), then that contributes to the 3's count. But this is still not enough to determine exact positions.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the 1 at (5,5). It needs one bomb in (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). If we can find that one of those is a bomb, perhaps we can proceed. But without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, maybe the 3 at (6,5) can help. The 3 at (6,5) has adjacent cells (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). The revealed cells here are (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1, (6,4)=3. The unexplored cells are (5,6), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). So three bombs needed here. If (5,6) is a bomb (as per the 1 at (5,5)), then that's one bomb. Then the 3 at (6,5) would need two more bombs in (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). But again, not enough info.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, if a number has all its bombs accounted for by adjacent flags, then the remaining cells can be revealed. But since there are no flags yet, that's not the case here.\n\nWait, looking at the 1 at (5,4). It has three unexplored cells: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). Let's say that one of these is a bomb. But how does that affect the 3 at (6,4)? The 3 at (6,4) needs three bombs in (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). If one of (5,3) or (6,3) is a bomb (from the 1 at (5,4)), then the 3 at (6,4) still needs two more bombs in the remaining cells. But there's no way to know exactly where.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 at (6,4) and the 3 at (6,5) share some bombs. For example, if (7,4) and (7,5) are bombs, they would count towards both 3s. But each 3 needs three bombs. So for (6,4), if (7,4) and (7,5) are bombs, then it needs one more bomb in (5,3), (6,3), or (7,3). For (6,5), those two bombs plus another in (5,6) or (6,6) or (7,6). But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be safely revealed. Let's look at the 1 at (4,5). It's a 1, so one bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). The revealed cells here are (4,4)=2, (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1. The unexplored cells are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). The 1 here requires exactly one bomb among these. Let's see if any of these cells are adjacent to other numbers that could help.\n\nFor example, (3,5) is adjacent to the 2 at (4,4). If (3,5) is a bomb, then the 2 at (4,4) would have one bomb accounted for, needing one more. But where would that be? Maybe (3,3) or (4,3) or (5,3). But this is not helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (4,6) is safe. If the 1 at (4,5) has its bomb in (3,5), then (4,6) would be safe. But how can we be sure?\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to find a cell that can be safely revealed based on existing numbers. For example, if a cell's adjacent numbers indicate that all possible bombs are already accounted for, then it's safe.\n\nLooking at the cell (5,6). It's adjacent to (4,5)=1, (5,5)=1, (6,5)=3. If (5,6) is a bomb, then the 1 at (4,5) would have that bomb, and the 1 at (5,5) would also have that bomb. But each of those 1s can only have one bomb. So if (5,6) is a bomb, then both (4,5) and (5,5) would have their bombs satisfied. But that's impossible because each 1 can only have one bomb. Therefore, (5,6) cannot be a bomb. Because if it were, then both 1s would be satisfied by the same bomb, but each 1 requires exactly one bomb in their own adjacent cells. Wait, but (5,6) is adjacent to both (4,5) and (5,5). So if (5,6) is a bomb, it would count towards both of their counts. But each of those 1s can have that bomb as their one. So that's allowed. Because a single bomb can be adjacent to multiple numbers. So that's possible. So (5,6) could be a bomb, and that would satisfy both the 1 at (4,5) and the 1 at (5,5). But then the 3 at (6,5) would have (5,6) as a bomb, contributing to its count. But the 3 at (6,5) needs three bombs. So if (5,6) is a bomb, then the remaining two bombs would need to be in (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). But this is possible.\n\nBut how does this help us? If (5,6) is a bomb, then the 1s at (4,5) and (5,5) are satisfied. But we can't know for sure yet. However, if there's a cell that can be proven safe, that's the way to go.\n\nWait, let's look at the cell (5,6). If we can determine that it's safe, we can reveal it. Alternatively, if it's a bomb, we need to flag it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the 1 at (5,5). It needs one bomb in (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). Suppose (5,6) is a bomb. Then the 1 at (5,5) is satisfied. But the 3 at (6,5) would have that bomb as part of its count. So the 3 at (6,5) would need two more bombs. But if (5,6) is a bomb, then the 3 at (6,5) would have (5,6) as one bomb, and perhaps (6,6) and (7,5) as others. But this is just a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (6,6) is a bomb. But again, no way to tell.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a cell that can be safely revealed based on the current information.\n\nLooking at the 1 at (5,4). It has three unexplored cells: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). Since it's a 1, exactly one of these is a bomb. Let's consider the 3 at (6,4). It needs three bombs in (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). If one of (5,3) or (6,3) is a bomb (from the 1 at (5,4)), then the 3 at (6,4) still needs two more bombs. But where?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (7,3) is a bomb. But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, perhaps the cell (5,3) is a bomb. If that's the case, then the 1 at (5,4) is satisfied, and the 3 at (6,4) would have one bomb accounted for. Then the 3 at (6,4) needs two more bombs in (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But again, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (6,3) is a bomb. Then the 1 at (5,4) is satisfied, and the 3 at (6,4) has one bomb. Then two more needed.\n\nThis line of thinking isn't leading to a clear conclusion. Let's try another approach.\n\nLooking at the 2 at (4,4). It needs two bombs in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). The revealed cells here are (4,5)=1, (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1. The unexplored cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (5,3). So the 2 at (4,4) must have two bombs among these five cells.\n\nNow, the 1 at (4,5) has adjacent cells (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). The 1 here needs one bomb in these cells. The unexplored cells are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). So the bomb for (4,5) must be in one of these. Let's say the bomb is in (3,5). Then that would also count towards the 2 at (4,4), since (3,5) is adjacent to (4,4). So if (3,5) is a bomb, then the 2 at (4,4) has one bomb accounted for, needing one more in (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (5,3). But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, if the bomb for (4,5) is in (3,4), then that would also count towards the 2 at (4,4). So the 2 at (4,4) would have one bomb in (3,4), needing another in (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (5,3). But again, not helpful.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let's look for a cell that can be safely revealed. For example, if a cell's adjacent numbers indicate that all possible bombs are already accounted for by other cells.\n\nLooking at the cell (3,4). It's adjacent to (4,4)=2 and (4,5)=1. If (3,4) were a bomb, then it would contribute to both the 2 and the 1. But the 1 at (4,5) can only have one bomb. So if (3,4) is a bomb, then the 1 at (4,5) is satisfied, and the 2 at (4,4) would have one bomb (from (3,4)), needing one more. But this is possible. However, we can't be sure if (3,4) is a bomb or not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (5,3) is a bomb. If so, then the 1 at (5,4) is satisfied, and the 3 at (6,4) would have one bomb. But again, no way to confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps the cell (6,3) is safe. Let's see. The 3 at (6,4) needs three bombs. If (6,3) is a bomb, then the 3 at (6,4) would have one bomb. But there's no other info to confirm this. Alternatively, if (6,3) is safe, revealing it could provide more information.\n\nBut how to determine if (6,3) is safe? Let's think. The 3 at (6,4) has three bombs in its adjacent cells. If we assume that (5,3) and (6,3) are bombs (from the 1 at (5,4) and the 3 at (6,4)), but that would mean the 1 at (5,4) has two bombs, which is impossible. So that's a conflict. Therefore, (5,3) and (6,3) cannot both be bombs. Because the 1 at (5,4) can only have one bomb in its adjacent cells. So if (5,3) is a bomb, then (6,3) cannot be a bomb. Similarly, if (6,3) is a bomb, then (5,3) cannot be. But the 3 at (6,4) needs three bombs. So if (5,3) is a bomb, then the 3 at (6,4) needs two more bombs in (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But (6,3) can't be a bomb if (5,3) is, because that would give the 1 at (5,4) two bombs. So this creates a contradiction. Therefore, (5,3) cannot be a bomb. Because if it were, the 3 at (6,4) would need two more bombs, but (6,3) can't be a bomb, leaving only (7,3), (7,4), (7,5) to provide two bombs. But that's possible. Wait, no contradiction here. The 1 at (5,4) has (5,3) as a bomb, which is one bomb. Then the 3 at (6,4) has (5,3) as one bomb, and needs two more in (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But (6,3) is adjacent to (5,4)'s 1, which already has one bomb (at (5,3)), so (6,3) can't be a bomb. Therefore, the two bombs for the 3 at (6,4) must be in (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But that's possible. So (5,3) could be a bomb, and the 3 at (6,4) gets two more bombs from (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But this is all hypothetical.\n\nAlternatively, if (5,3) is not a bomb, then the 1 at (5,4) must have its bomb in (4,3) or (6,3). Let's say it's in (6,3). Then the 3 at (6,4) would have (6,3) as one bomb, needing two more in (5,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But (5,3) is not a bomb in this scenario, so the two bombs must be in (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). Again, possible.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe I should look for a cell that can be safely revealed based on the numbers. For example, if a cell's adjacent numbers indicate that all possible bombs are already accounted for.\n\nLooking at the cell (7,4). It's adjacent to (6,4)=3, (6,5)=3, (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). But all these are unexplored except (6,4) and (6,5). The 3s at (6,4) and (6,5) might require bombs in (7,4) and (7,5). But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the cell (3,3). It's adjacent to (4,4)=2. If (3,3) is a bomb, then the 2 at (4,4) would have one bomb accounted for. But there's no other info to confirm this.\n\nHmm. Maybe the safest move is to reveal a cell that has the least chance of being a bomb based on the current numbers. For example, revealing a cell that is adjacent to lower numbers.\n\nLooking at the cell (5,6). It's adjacent to (4,5)=1, (5,5)=1, and (6,5)=3. If (5,6) is a bomb, it would satisfy both 1s. But the 3 at (6,5) would then need two more bombs. However, if (5,6) is not a bomb, then the 1s at (4,5) and (5,5) must have their bombs elsewhere. But how to determine this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (4,6) is safe. The 1 at (4,5) needs one bomb in (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). If (4,6) is safe, then the bomb must be in one of the others. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a cell that is definitely safe. For example, if a number has all its required bombs already adjacent, then the remaining cells are safe. But since there are no flags, this isn't applicable.\n\nWait, looking at the 1 at (5,5). It needs one bomb in (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). Suppose we reveal (5,6). If it's safe, then the bomb must be in (4,6) or (6,6). But this is a risky move if we don't know.\n\nAlternatively, look for cells that are not adjacent to any numbers. For example, the cells in the upper part of the board. But since the game has 10 bombs, and the lower middle area has some numbers, it's possible that the bombs are clustered there. Revealing a cell far from the numbers might be safer, but that's not guaranteed.\n\nBut according to the board state, the only revealed cells are in rows 4,5,6. The rest are all unexplored. So maybe the bombs are concentrated around the revealed numbers. Therefore, revealing a cell far away might be safer. For example, (0,0). But that's just a guess, and Minesweeper strategy usually involves working around the known numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a cell adjacent to a 1 that can be safely revealed. For example, the 1 at (5,4) has three unexplored cells. If two of them are safe, but we don't know which. But without more info, it's hard to proceed.\n\nWait, let's think about the 3 at (6,4). It needs three bombs. The cells (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). Suppose that (7,3), (7,4), (7,5) are all bombs. That would account for three bombs, satisfying the 3 at (6,4). Then the 3 at (6,5) would need three bombs in (5,6), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). But (7,4) and (7,5) are already bombs, so the 3 at (6,5) would need one more bomb in (5,6), (6,6), or (7,6). This scenario is possible, but how does that help us?\n\nIf (7,3), (7,4), (7,5) are bombs, then the 3 at (6,4) is satisfied. The 1 at (5,4) would need one bomb in (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). But in this scenario, none of those are bombs. So that's a conflict. Therefore, this scenario is invalid.\n\nSo the 3 at (6,4) can't have all three bombs in (7,3), (7,4), (7,5) because that would leave the 1 at (5,4) with no bombs in its adjacent cells, which is impossible. Therefore, at least one of (5,3), (6,3) must be a bomb to satisfy the 1 at (5,4). Let's say (5,3) is a bomb. Then the 3 at (6,4) has one bomb, needing two more. Those could be in (6,3) and (7,3), for example. But then the 1 at (5,4) has its bomb at (5,3), which is valid. The 3 at (6,4) would have bombs at (5,3), (6,3), and (7,3), totaling three. But then the 3 at (6,5) would need three bombs. Let's see: (5,6), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). If (7,4) and (7,5) are bombs, that's two, plus one more in (5,6) or (6,6) or (7,6). This is possible.\n\nBut how does this help us determine a safe move? If (5,3) is a bomb, then we can flag it. But since we have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs, but no flags placed yet, placing a flag here would be a guess. But according to the rules, we need to verify that the flag doesn't conflict with existing numbers.\n\nWait, if we place a flag at (5,3), does that conflict with any numbers? The 1 at (5,4) would have one flag adjacent, which is correct. The 3 at (6,4) would have one flag (at (5,3)), so it needs two more bombs. That's okay. So placing a flag at (5,3) is possible. But is it correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (5,3) is safe. But how to know?\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to find a cell that must be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nThe 3 at (6,4) needs three bombs. The 1 at (5,4) needs one bomb in (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). Let's assume that (5,3) is a bomb. Then the 3 at (6,4) has one bomb, needing two more. The remaining cells for the 3 at (6,4) are (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). If (6,3) is also a bomb, then the 3 at (6,4) has two bombs, needing one more. But the 1 at (5,4) already has its bomb at (5,3), so (6,3) being a bomb would not affect that. But wait, (6,3) is adjacent to (5,4)'s 1. If (6,3) is a bomb, then the 1 at (5,4) would have two bombs adjacent (5,3) and (6,3), which is impossible. Therefore, (6,3) cannot be a bomb if (5,3) is a bomb. Therefore, the 3 at (6,4) must get its remaining two bombs from (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But that's possible.\n\nSo if (5,3) is a bomb, then (6,3) cannot be a bomb. Therefore, the 3 at (6,4) must have two bombs in (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But how does that help us?\n\nIf we place a flag at (5,3), then the 1 at (5,4) is satisfied. The 3 at (6,4) would need two more bombs. But we can't place flags there yet without more info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (7,3) is a bomb. But again, no way to confirm.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Let's try to make a move based on the available information. The safest move might be to reveal a cell that is adjacent to a 1 and has the least chance of being a bomb. For example, the cell (6,3) is adjacent to the 3 at (6,4) and the 1 at (5,4). If the 1 at (5,4) has its bomb at (5,3), then (6,3) is safe. But if the bomb is at (6,3), then revealing it would lose the game. But how to decide?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cell (3,5) is a bomb. But again, no way to know.\n\nWait, let's look at the 2 at (4,4). It needs two bombs in its adjacent cells. The 1 at (4,5) needs one bomb. If the bomb for (4,5) is at (3,5), then that also counts towards the 2 at (4,4). Then the 2 at (4,4) would need one more bomb in (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (5,3). Let's say (5,3) is a bomb. Then the 2 at (4,4) is satisfied. The 1 at (5,4) would have its bomb at (5,3). The 3 at (6,4) would have one bomb at (5,3), needing two more. This scenario is possible. But how to confirm?\n\nIf this is the case, then the cell (3,5) is a bomb (for the 1 at (4,5)), and (5,3) is a bomb (for the 2 at (4,4) and the 1 at (5,4)). Then the 3 at (6,4) needs two more bombs in (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But (6,3) is adjacent to the 1 at (5,4), which already has a bomb at (5,3), so (6,3) can't be a bomb. Therefore, the two bombs must be in (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But this is possible.\n\nBut without flags, we can't mark these. So perhaps the next move is to place a flag at (5,3) or (3,5). But placing a flag requires that it doesn't conflict with existing numbers. For example, placing a flag at (5,3) would satisfy the 1 at (5,4), and the 2 at (4,4) would need one more bomb. But how do we know if that's correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (5,3) is safe. If we reveal it and it's safe, then we can proceed. But if it's a bomb, the game ends. This is risky.\n\nGiven that there are 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining, and no flags placed yet, perhaps the best move is to find a cell that is definitely safe based on the numbers. Let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a number which already has all its bombs accounted for.\n\nFor example, the cell (5,5) is a 1. If we can determine that all its adjacent bombs are already flagged, then the remaining cells are safe. But since there are no flags, this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell that is adjacent to a number which has exactly as many unexplored cells as the number. For example, if a 1 has one unexplored cell adjacent, then that cell must be a bomb. But in this case, the 1 at (5,4) has three unexplored cells, so that doesn't apply.\n\nWait, looking at the 1 at (5,5). It has three unexplored cells: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). The number is 1, so one of these must be a bomb. But we can't determine which one. So revealing any of them could be risky.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe the best move is to reveal a cell that is adjacent to a 1 and has the least number of adjacent unexplored cells. For example, the cell (5,6) is adjacent to the 1 at (5,5) and the 3 at (6,5). But this is still risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cell (3,5) is a bomb. But again, no way to confirm.\n\nWait, let's think about the 3 at (6,4) again. It needs three bombs. The 1 at (5,4) needs one bomb. If the 1's bomb is at (5,3), then the 3 at (6,4) has one bomb, needing two more. The remaining cells for the 3 are (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But (6,3) can't be a bomb because it's adjacent to the 1 at (5,4), which already has a bomb at (5,3). So the two bombs must be in (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). If we assume that two of these are bombs, then the 3 at (6,4) is satisfied. But how does that help us?\n\nIf we reveal (7,4), and it's safe, then we can proceed. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (7,4) is a bomb, but we can't know.\n\nThis is really tough. I think I need to make a move based on the most logical deduction possible. Let's go back to the 1 at (5,4). It has three unexplored cells: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). The 3 at (6,4) needs three bombs. If we assume that (5,3) is a bomb (satisfying the 1 at (5,4)), then the 3 at (6,4) needs two more bombs in (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). But (6,3) can't be a bomb because it's adjacent to the 1 at (5,4), which already has a bomb. Therefore, the two bombs must be in (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). This leaves (6,3) as safe. So revealing (6,3) would be safe.\n\nYes! Because if (5,3) is a bomb (satisfying the 1 at (5,4)), then (6,3) cannot be a bomb, so it's safe to reveal. Therefore, the cell (6,3) is safe and can be revealed.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The 1 at (5,4) requires exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells (4,3), (5,3), or (6,3). The 3 at (6,4) needs three bombs in its adjacent cells. If (5,3) is the bomb for the 1 at (5,4), then the 3 at (6,4) must have its remaining two bombs in other cells, making (6,3) safe. Revealing (6,3) is the logical next move.\n\nMOVE: 6,3,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . 2 1 1 . . .\n5 . . . . . 1 1 . . .\n6 . . . . 3 3 2 . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 4, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next move, either placing a flag or revealing a tile. Let's start by analyzing the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, the board is mostly unexplored except for the lower middle part. Let's focus on the revealed numbers and empty spaces. Starting from row 4, there's a line of numbers: 1,1,2,2,1,1. Then in row 5, there's a 1, an empty space (_), 1, then some unexplored. Row 6 has 1, empty, 2, 3, 3, 2. Rows 7,8,9 have similar patterns with empty spaces and numbers.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 2 is an empty revealed space (_). The number at (5,1) is 1. Let's check adjacent cells. The cells around (5,1) would be the 8 surrounding squares. But since (5,2) is empty, maybe there's a flag nearby. Wait, no flags are shown yet. Wait, the board legend says F is a flagged space, but the current board doesn't show any Fs. So maybe there are no flags placed yet. But the flags remaining are 10. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says the current state includes the board as shown. So looking at the given board, there are no Fs. So all the flags are remaining. So the user hasn't placed any flags yet. So the flags remaining is 10, which is the total bombs. So we need to find where to place flags based on the numbers.\n\nLet's look for cells that must be bombs. For example, the number 1 in (5,1). The adjacent cells include (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). But (5,2) is an empty revealed space, so that's safe. The number 1 at (5,1) means exactly one bomb in those adjacent cells. Let's check which of those are unexplored. The cells around (5,1):\n\n- (4,0): unexplored (.)\n- (4,1): 1 (already revealed)\n- (4,2): 1 (revealed)\n- (5,0): unexplored (.)\n- (5,2): empty (_)\n- (6,0): unexplored (.)\n- (6,1): 1 (revealed)\n- (6,2): empty (_)\n\nWait, (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. So adjacent cells would be:\n\nRow 4: columns 0,1,2\nRow 5: columns 0 and 2\nRow 6: columns 0,1,2\n\nLooking at those cells:\n\nRow 4, column 0: . (unexplored)\nRow 4, column 1: 1 (already revealed)\nRow 4, column 2: 1 (revealed)\nRow 5, column 0: . (unexplored)\nRow 5, column 2: _ (empty)\nRow 6, column 0: . (unexplored)\nRow 6, column 1: 1 (revealed)\nRow 6, column 2: _ (empty)\n\nSo the only unexplored cells adjacent to (5,1) are (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). The number is 1, so exactly one of these three must be a bomb. But how do we determine which one?\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at other numbers can help. Let's check row 6, column 3 which is a 2. The cell (6,3) is 2. Let's see its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells would include (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). But (5,2) is empty, (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is . (unexplored), (6,2) is empty, (6,4) is 3, (7,2) is empty, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is . (unexplored). Wait, the 2 at (6,3) must have two bombs adjacent. Let's see which cells are adjacent and unexplored. The adjacent cells:\n\nRow 5: columns 2,3,4. (5,2) is empty, (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is . (unexplored)\nRow 6: columns 2,4. (6,2) is empty, (6,4) is 3\nRow 7: columns 2,3,4. (7,2) is empty, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is . \n\nSo the unexplored cells adjacent to (6,3) are (5,4) and (7,4). The number is 2, so there must be two bombs in those two cells. But that's only two cells. So both (5,4) and (7,4) must be bombs. But wait, the number is 2, so exactly two bombs. If those are the only possible cells, then both must be bombs. So we can flag them. But let's check if that's correct.\n\nWait, (6,3) is 2. Let's count the adjacent bombs. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(5,2) is empty, so no bomb.\n(5,3) is 1, which is a number, so no bomb.\n(5,4) is unexplored.\n(6,2) is empty.\n(6,4) is 3, which is a number.\n(7,2) is empty.\n(7,3) is 2, a number.\n(7,4) is unexplored.\n\nSo the only possible bomb locations are (5,4) and (7,4). Since the number is 2, both must be bombs. So we can flag those two. But wait, the flags remaining are 10, and we have 10 bombs. So if we flag both, that's two flags. But let's check if there's any conflict.\n\nBut before placing flags, we need to make sure that other numbers are not conflicting. For example, (5,3) is 1. Let's check its adjacent cells. (5,3) is 1. The adjacent cells would be (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). \n\nLooking at those:\n\n(4,2) is 1 (revealed)\n(4,3) is 2 (revealed)\n(4,4) is 2 (revealed)\n(5,2) is empty\n(5,4) is . (unexplored)\n(6,2) is empty\n(6,3) is 2 (revealed)\n(6,4) is 3 (revealed)\n\nSo the only unexplored cell adjacent to (5,3) is (5,4). The number is 1, so there must be exactly one bomb in those cells. If (5,4) is a bomb (as per the previous analysis), then that's the one. So that's correct. So (5,4) is a bomb. Then (5,3) is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is 3. Let's check its adjacent cells. (6,4) is 3. Adjacent cells would be (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). \n\nLooking at those:\n\n(5,3) is 1\n(5,4) is . (unexplored)\n(5,5) is . (unexplored)\n(6,3) is 2\n(6,5) is 3 (revealed)\n(7,3) is 2\n(7,4) is . (unexplored)\n(7,5) is . (unexplored)\n\nSo the unexplored cells adjacent to (6,4) are (5,4), (5,5), (7,4), (7,5). The number is 3. If (5,4) is a bomb (as per previous), then we need two more bombs among (5,5), (7,4), (7,5). But (5,5) is adjacent to (5,4), which is a bomb. Let's see if other numbers can help.\n\nLooking at (5,5) is . (unexplored). Wait, (5,5) is part of the row 5, which has a 1 at (5,5) (no, wait row 5's columns 5 is part of the 2nd row in the given board state. Wait, looking back at the board:\n\nRow 5: . 1 _ 1 . 1 1 . . . \n\nWait, row 5's columns 0 is ., 1 is 1, 2 is _, 3 is 1, 4 is ., 5 is 1, 6 is 1, etc. So (5,5) is 1. Wait, no, the given board for row 5 is:\n\n5 . 1 _ 1 . 1 1 . . .\n\nSo columns 0: ., 1:1, 2:_, 3:1, 4:., 5:1, 6:1, etc. So (5,5) is 1. So (5,5) is a revealed 1. So adjacent to (5,5) are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). \n\n(4,4) is 2 (revealed)\n(4,5) is 2 (revealed)\n(4,6) is 1 (revealed)\n(5,4) is . (unexplored)\n(5,6) is 1 (revealed)\n(6,4) is 3 (revealed)\n(6,5) is 3 (revealed)\n(6,6) is 2 (revealed)\n\nSo the only unexplored cell adjacent to (5,5) is (5,4). The number at (5,5) is 1, so exactly one bomb in adjacent cells. If (5,4) is a bomb (as per previous analysis), then that's the one. So that's correct. So (5,4) is a bomb, which satisfies both (5,3) and (5,5).\n\nNow, back to (6,4) which is 3. The adjacent bombs would be (5,4) (bomb), and then two more from (5,5), (7,4), (7,5). But (5,5) is a revealed 1, which already has its bomb at (5,4). So (5,5) can't have any other bombs adjacent. Therefore, (5,5)'s adjacent cells (other than (5,4)) are all safe. So (5,5) is a 1, so (5,4) is the only bomb adjacent to it. Therefore, (5,5) is safe. So the remaining bombs for (6,4) must be in (7,4) and (7,5), but wait, (6,4) is 3. If (5,4) is a bomb, then we need two more bombs in (5,5), (7,4), (7,5). But (5,5) is a 1, which already has (5,4) as a bomb. So (5,5) can't have any other bombs adjacent. Therefore, the bombs must be in (7,4) and (7,5), but that's two bombs. But (6,4) is 3, so three bombs. Wait, this is conflicting. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, (6,4) is 3. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(5,3) =1, (5,4)=bomb, (5,5)=1, (6,3)=2, (6,5)=3, (7,3)=2, (7,4)=., (7,5)=.\n\nSo the bombs adjacent to (6,4) are (5,4) (bomb), and then two more. But (5,5) is a 1, which already has (5,4) as a bomb. So (5,5) can't have any other bombs adjacent. Therefore, the remaining bombs for (6,4) must be in (7,4) and (7,5). But that's two bombs, making a total of three (5,4, 7,4, 7,5). But (6,4) is 3, so that's correct. So (7,4) and (7,5) must be bombs. Wait, but (5,4) is one, and (7,4) and (7,5) would be two more, totaling three. So that's correct. So (7,4) and (7,5) must be bombs. But wait, (7,4) is adjacent to (7,3)=2. Let's check that.\n\n(7,3) is 2. Adjacent cells include (6,2)=_, (6,3)=2, (6,4)=3, (7,2)=_, (7,4)=., (8,2)=_, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=. \n\nSo the unexplored cells adjacent to (7,3) are (7,4) and (8,4). The number is 2, so there must be two bombs here. If (7,4) is a bomb (as per previous analysis), then (8,4) must also be a bomb. But wait, (7,4) is adjacent to (6,4)=3, which requires three bombs. If (7,4) is a bomb, then (7,5) must also be a bomb. But (7,5) is adjacent to (7,4) and (6,4). Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to map this out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward spot to look for. Let's check row 7, column 2 is empty (_). The number at (7,1) is 1. Let's see the adjacent cells. (7,1) is 1. Adjacent cells are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). \n\nLooking at those:\n\n(6,0) is . (unexplored)\n(6,1) is 1 (revealed)\n(6,2) is _ (empty)\n(7,0) is . (unexplored)\n(7,2) is _ (empty)\n(8,0) is . (unexplored)\n(8,1) is 1 (revealed)\n(8,2) is _ (empty)\n\nSo the only unexplored cells adjacent to (7,1) are (6,0), (7,0), (8,0). The number is 1, so exactly one of these must be a bomb. But how to determine which one?\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8, column 1 is 1. (8,1) is 1. Adjacent cells are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). \n\n(7,0) is . (unexplored)\n(7,1) is 1 (revealed)\n(7,2) is _ (empty)\n(8,0) is . (unexplored)\n(8,2) is _ (empty)\n(9,0) is . (unexplored)\n(9,1) is 1 (revealed)\n(9,2) is _ (empty)\n\nSo the unexplored cells adjacent to (8,1) are (7,0), (8,0), (9,0). The number is 1, so exactly one of these is a bomb. But this overlaps with the cells adjacent to (7,1). So if (7,0) is a bomb, then both (7,1) and (8,1) would have their bombs accounted for. But that's possible only if (7,0) is the bomb for both. Let's check:\n\nIf (7,0) is a bomb, then (7,1) would have one bomb (correct), and (8,1) would have one bomb (correct). But are there any other cells adjacent to (7,0) that might affect other numbers?\n\nAlternatively, if (7,0) is a bomb, then any numbers adjacent to it must account for it. For example, (6,0) is adjacent to (7,0). (6,0) is unexplored. But if (7,0) is a bomb, then (6,0) would be adjacent to a bomb. But (6,0) is adjacent to (5,0) and (5,1) as well. (5,1) is 1. Let's check (5,1)'s adjacent cells again. (5,1) is 1, and adjacent unexplored cells are (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). If (7,0) is a bomb, then (6,0) is adjacent to (7,0), but (5,1) is looking for one bomb in (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). If (6,0) is adjacent to a bomb at (7,0), but (5,1) is looking for exactly one bomb in those three cells. So if (7,0) is a bomb, then (6,0) is adjacent to it, but (5,1) would need exactly one bomb in (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). But (6,0) is adjacent to (7,0) which is a bomb, but (5,1) doesn't count that. Wait, no. The bomb at (7,0) is not adjacent to (5,1). The cells adjacent to (5,1) are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). So (7,0) is not adjacent to (5,1). Therefore, the bomb at (7,0) would affect (6,0), but (5,1) is looking for a bomb in (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). So if (7,0) is a bomb, then (6,0) is adjacent to it, but (5,1) is only considering (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). So if (6,0) is adjacent to a bomb at (7,0), but (5,1) is looking for one bomb in (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). So if (7,0) is a bomb, then (6,0) is adjacent to it, but (5,1) doesn't count that bomb. Because (5,1) is only adjacent to (6,0), not (7,0). So the bomb at (7,0) is not adjacent to (5,1). Therefore, (5,1) still needs one bomb in (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). So if (7,0) is a bomb, that doesn't affect (5,1)'s count. Therefore, (5,1) still needs one bomb in those three cells. So (7,0) being a bomb doesn't help (5,1). So perhaps (5,1) has a bomb in (4,0), (5,0), or (6,0), and (7,1) and (8,1) have a bomb in (7,0), (8,0), or (9,0). But this seems like a separate area.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to find a cell that we can definitively determine as a bomb or safe.\n\nLooking back at row 5, column 4 (5,4) is unexplored. As per earlier analysis, (5,4) must be a bomb because of the 1 at (5,3) and the 2 at (6,3). So placing a flag at (5,4) would be correct. Let's confirm again.\n\n(5,3) is 1. Adjacent cells: (4,2)=1, (4,3)=2, (4,4)=2, (5,2)=_, (5,4)=., (6,2)=_, (6,3)=2, (6,4)=3. The only unexplored cell is (5,4). So (5,4) must be a bomb. Therefore, flagging (5,4) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is 2. Adjacent unexplored cells are (5,4) and (7,4). If (5,4) is a bomb, then (7,4) must also be a bomb to satisfy the 2 at (6,3). Wait, no. (6,3) is 2. The adjacent cells are (5,2)=_, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=., (6,2)=_, (6,4)=3, (7,2)=_, (7,3)=2, (7,4)=.. So the unexplored cells are (5,4) and (7,4). If (5,4) is a bomb, then (6,3) needs one more bomb. So (7,4) must also be a bomb. But (6,3) is 2, so two bombs. So yes, both (5,4) and (7,4) must be bombs. But wait, (5,4) is adjacent to (5,3) which is 1, and (5,5) which is 1. So (5,4) being a bomb satisfies both (5,3) and (5,5). Then (7,4) being a bomb would satisfy (6,3) and (7,3). \n\nBut (7,3) is 2. Adjacent cells include (6,2)=_, (6,3)=2, (6,4)=3, (7,2)=_, (7,4)=., (8,2)=_, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=.. So the unexplored cells are (7,4) and (8,4). If (7,4) is a bomb, then (7,3) needs one more bomb. So (8,4) must also be a bomb. But (7,3) is 2, so two bombs. So (7,4) and (8,4) must be bombs. But then (6,4) is 3, which requires three bombs. The adjacent cells to (6,4) are (5,3)=1, (5,4)=bomb, (5,5)=1, (6,3)=2, (6,5)=3, (7,3)=2, (7,4)=bomb, (7,5)=.. So bombs are (5,4), (7,4), and (7,5). Wait, but (7,5) is adjacent to (6,5)=3. Let's check (6,5)=3. Adjacent cells include (5,4)=bomb, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=3, (6,6)=2, (7,4)=bomb, (7,5)=., (7,6)=.. So (6,5)=3 requires three bombs. The bombs so far are (5,4) and (7,4). So (7,5) must be a bomb to make three. So (7,5) is a bomb. Then (7,5) is adjacent to (7,4) (bomb), (7,6)=., (6,5)=3, (6,6)=2, (8,5)=., etc. \n\nThis seems to be a chain of required bombs. But let's get back to the initial step. The first definite bomb is (5,4). So placing a flag there is safe. Let's check if there's any conflict.\n\nIf we flag (5,4), then the number at (5,3)=1 is satisfied. The number at (5,5)=1 is also satisfied. The number at (6,3)=2 would have one bomb (5,4), so another bomb must be at (7,4). Then (7,3)=2 would require another bomb at (8,4). And (6,4)=3 would require bombs at (5,4), (7,4), and (7,5). But this is all possible. Since there are 10 bombs, and we're placing flags as needed.\n\nSo the first move should be to flag (5,4). Let's confirm again:\n\n- (5,3)=1: adjacent bomb at (5,4) \u2192 correct.\n- (5,5)=1: adjacent bomb at (5,4) \u2192 correct.\n- (6,3)=2: bombs at (5,4) and (7,4) \u2192 need to flag (7,4) next.\n- (6,4)=3: bombs at (5,4), (7,4), (7,5) \u2192 need to flag those.\n- (7,3)=2: bombs at (7,4) and (8,4) \u2192 need to flag those.\n\nBut for the first move, flagging (5,4) is safe and necessary. There's no conflict here. So the next move should be to place a flag at (5,4).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The number 1 at (5,3) and (5,5) both require exactly one bomb in their adjacent cells. The only unexplored cell adjacent to both is (5,4), making it a definite bomb. Placing a flag here is safe and necessary.\n\nMOVE: 5,4,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . 1 1 2 2 1 1 . . .\n5 . 1 _ 1 . 1 1 . . .\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 . . .\n7 . 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n8 . 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n9 . 1 _ 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 7, "y": 4, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at the Minesweeper board provided. The goal is to figure out the next safe move. Let me start by analyzing the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs with 9 flags remaining. The bottom part of the board (rows 4 to 9) has some revealed numbers and flags. Let me focus on the areas where numbers are visible because those are the clues.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4 is flagged (F). That's probably a bomb. Let's check the numbers around it. For example, the cell at (5,3) is 1. Since there's a flag at (5,4), which is adjacent to (5,3), that 1 must be satisfied by that flag. So the other adjacent cells around (5,3) should be safe. Let's see which cells those are. The adjacent cells to (5,3) would be (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). But (5,4) is flagged, so the other cells around (5,3) should have no bombs. For example, (5,2) is an empty revealed space (_), so that's already safe. But maybe there are other cells around here that are unexplored.\n\nWait, looking at row 5, column 2 is an empty revealed space. So maybe the cells around (5,3) that are still unexplored. Let's check. For example, (4,4) is part of row 4, which has numbers. Let's see row 4: columns 1 to 6 are 1,1,2,2,1,1. So (4,4) is 2. The cell (4,4) is a 2. Let's check adjacent flags. The cell (5,4) is a flag, which is adjacent to (4,4). So that's one bomb accounted for. The 2 at (4,4) would need another bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (4,4) are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). The flag at (5,4) is one, so there must be another bomb. The other cells around (4,4) that are unexplored: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) are all in rows 3, which are unexplored (all .). Also, (5,5) is 1. Hmm. Wait, (4,4) is 2, and has one flag adjacent. So there's another bomb needed. The remaining adjacent cells could be in the unexplored ones. But maybe there's another way to find safe moves.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 4 is 3. Let's check the cells around it. The cell (6,4) is 3. Adjacent cells include (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The flag at (5,4) is one bomb. The cell (5,5) is 1. Let's see, the 3 at (6,4) would need two more bombs. But (5,5) is 1, which might be connected. Wait, maybe I should look for cells that can be safely revealed based on existing numbers and flags.\n\nAnother area to check is row 7. The cell (7,3) is 2. Let's see its adjacent cells. The cells around (7,3) are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). The cell (7,3) is 2. Let's check if there are any flags nearby. The cell (7,4) is a . (unexplored), (6,4) is 3. Wait, (6,4) is 3, which we already considered. The cell (7,3) is 2. Are there any flags adjacent to it? Let's see. The cells (6,2) is empty, (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3, (7,2) is empty, (7,4) is unexplored, (8,2) is empty, (8,3) is 2, (8,4) is unexplored. So no flags adjacent to (7,3). Therefore, the 2 at (7,3) must have two bombs in its adjacent unexplored cells. The adjacent unexplored cells are (7,4), (8,4), (6,4) is 3, which is already revealed. Wait, (6,4) is 3, which is adjacent to (7,3). But (6,4) is a 3, which might have its own bombs accounted for. Hmm, maybe this is getting complicated. Let's look for a more straightforward case.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5 is F (flagged). Wait, no, row 5, column 4 is F. Let me check again. The cell (5,4) is F. The cell (5,5) is 1. So the 1 at (5,5) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent cells to (5,5) are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). The cell (5,4) is F, which is one bomb. So the other cells around (5,5) must have no bombs. Let's check if any of those are unexplored. For example, (4,6) is 1 (from row 4, column 6). (6,6) is 2. So the only unexplored cells adjacent to (5,5) are (4,6) is already 1, (5,6) is 1, (6,5) is 3, (6,6) is 2. Wait, no, (5,5) is 1, and the adjacent cells that are unexplored? Let me check again. The cells adjacent to (5,5) are:\n\n- (4,4): 2 (already revealed)\n- (4,5): 2 (row 4, column 5 is 2)\n- (4,6): 1 (row 4, column 6 is 1)\n- (5,4): F (flagged)\n- (5,6): 1 (row 5, column 6 is 1)\n- (6,4): 3 (row 6, column 4 is 3)\n- (6,5): 3 (row 6, column 5 is 3)\n- (6,6): 2 (row 6, column 6 is 2)\n\nAll of these are revealed except (5,4) is flagged. So the 1 at (5,5) is satisfied by the flag at (5,4). Therefore, all other adjacent cells are safe. But all those cells are already revealed. So maybe that's not helpful.\n\nLet me look for another area. Let's check row 6, column 3 is 2. The cell (6,3) is 2. Adjacent cells include (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). The flag at (5,4) is one bomb. So the 2 at (6,3) needs one more bomb. The adjacent cells that are unexplored: (5,2) is empty (revealed as _), (5,3) is 1, (6,2) is empty, (7,2) is empty, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is unexplored (.). So the only unexplored cell adjacent to (6,3) is (7,4). Therefore, (7,4) must be a bomb. But wait, the cell (7,3) is 2. Let's check that. The cell (7,3) is 2. Its adjacent cells include (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). The cell (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3. The unexplored cells here are (7,4), (8,4), (8,2) is empty, (8,3) is 2. So (7,4) and (8,4) are unexplored. The 2 at (7,3) needs two bombs. If (7,4) is a bomb (as per the previous reasoning from (6,3)), then that would account for one. Then another bomb would be needed in (8,4) perhaps. But how does that fit with other numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe (7,4) is a bomb. Let's see. If (7,4) is a bomb, then the 2 at (7,3) would have one bomb, and need another. But where? The other adjacent cells to (7,3) are (6,2) (empty), (6,3) (2), (6,4) (3), (7,2) (empty), (8,2) (empty), (8,3) (2), (8,4) (unexplored). So if (7,4) is a bomb, then (8,4) would need to be another bomb to satisfy (7,3)'s 2. But then, looking at (8,3) which is 2. The adjacent cells to (8,3) are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). If (7,4) and (8,4) are bombs, then (8,3) would have two bombs adjacent, which matches its number. That seems possible. But how do we confirm this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safe cell to reveal. Let's look for cells that are definitely safe based on existing numbers and flags.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 2 is an empty revealed space (_). The cell (5,2) is empty. Let's check the numbers around it. The cell (5,2) is adjacent to (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). The cell (5,1) is 1 (from row 5, column 1). The cell (4,1) is 1 (row 4, column 1). The cell (4,2) is 1 (row 4, column 2). The cell (4,3) is 2 (row 4, column 3). The cell (5,3) is 1. The cell (6,1) is 1 (row 6, column 1). The cell (6,2) is empty. The cell (6,3) is 2. So the numbers around (5,2) are 1,1,2,1,1,2. Since (5,2) is empty, all adjacent bombs must be accounted for by the numbers. For example, the 1 at (5,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent cells to (5,1) are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). But (5,1) is 1, and (4,1) is 1. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's look for a more straightforward case.\n\nAnother approach: check the numbers that are already satisfied by existing flags. For example, the cell (5,3) is 1 and has a flag at (5,4). So all other adjacent cells to (5,3) must be safe. Let's check which cells are adjacent to (5,3). They are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). The flag is at (5,4). So the other cells should be safe. Let's see if any of those are unexplored. For example, (4,2) is 1 (revealed), (4,3) is 2 (revealed), (4,4) is 2 (revealed), (5,2) is empty, (6,2) is empty, (6,3) is 2 (revealed), (6,4) is 3 (revealed). So all adjacent cells to (5,3) are either revealed or empty. So no unexplored cells here. Hmm.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 5 is 3. The cell (6,5) is 3. Let's check adjacent cells. They are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). The flag at (5,4) is one bomb. The cell (5,5) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,4). The cell (5,6) is 1. The cell (6,4) is 3, (6,6) is 2. The cell (7,4) is unexplored, (7,5) is . (unexplored), (7,6) is . (unexplored). So the 3 at (6,5) needs three bombs. We already have one from (5,4). So two more bombs needed. The unexplored cells adjacent to (6,5) are (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). But how can we determine which of these are bombs?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be safely revealed. Let's look for a number that has exactly as many adjacent flags as its number, meaning all other adjacent cells are safe. For example, the cell (4,1) is 1. Let's check adjacent flags. The adjacent cells to (4,1) are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Are there any flags here? The cell (5,1) is 1, (5,2) is empty. So no flags. Therefore, the 1 at (4,1) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. All adjacent cells are unexplored except (4,2) is 1, (5,1) is 1, (5,2) is empty. The unexplored cells are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (5,0). So one of these must be a bomb. But without more info, it's hard to tell. Maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nLet me check the cell (6,4) which is 3. Adjacent cells include (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The flag at (5,4) is one bomb. The cell (5,5) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,4). The cell (5,3) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,4). So the 3 at (6,4) needs two more bombs. The adjacent unexplored cells are (7,4) and (7,5). So those two could be bombs. But how to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, column 3 is 2. If we assume that (7,4) is a bomb (as per earlier reasoning), then the 2 at (7,3) would have one bomb, needing another. The other adjacent unexplored cell is (8,4). So maybe (8,4) is a bomb. But how does that affect other numbers?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 8, column 3 is 2. The cell (8,3) is 2. Adjacent cells are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). The cell (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is unexplored, (8,4) is unexplored. So the 2 at (8,3) needs two bombs. If (7,4) and (8,4) are bombs, that would satisfy it. But again, this is speculative.\n\nWait, maybe there's a cell that can be safely revealed. Let's check the cell (7,4). If the 3 at (6,4) needs two bombs in (7,4) and (7,5), but how do we know? Alternatively, maybe there's a cell that's definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 2 is empty (_). The cell (7,2) is empty. Let's check the numbers around it. The adjacent cells are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). The cell (6,1) is 1, (6,2) is empty, (6,3) is 2, (7,3) is 2, (8,2) is empty, (8,3) is 2. So the numbers around (7,2) are 1, 2, 2, 2. Since (7,2) is empty, all adjacent bombs are accounted for. For example, the 1 at (6,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent cells to (6,1) are (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2). The cell (5,1) is 1, (5,2) is empty, (6,2) is empty, (7,1) is unexplored (.), (7,2) is empty. So the 1 at (6,1) must have one bomb in its adjacent cells. The unexplored cells here are (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (7,1). So one of those must be a bomb. But again, not helpful for finding a safe move.\n\nLet me try to find a cell that is definitely safe. For example, if a number has all its required bombs already flagged, then the remaining adjacent cells are safe. Let's look for such a case.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 3 is 1. The adjacent flag is at (5,4). So all other adjacent cells are safe. But as checked earlier, all adjacent cells are already revealed or empty. So no unexplored cells here.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 6 is 1. The cell (5,6) is 1. Let's check adjacent cells. They are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). The cell (5,5) is 1, (4,5) is 2, (4,6) is 1, (6,5) is 3, (6,6) is 2. The unexplored cells are (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). The 1 at (5,6) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. The only possible unexplored cells are (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). But without flags, it's hard to tell. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: the total bombs are 10, and there are 9 flags remaining. So one bomb is already flagged (at (5,4)), but wait, the flags remaining are 9. Wait, the game info says Flags remaining: 9, Bombs: 10. So if there's already one flag placed (at (5,4)), then the remaining flags to place are 9. That makes sense because total bombs are 10, and one is flagged. So 9 flags left. So the flag at (5,4) is correct. So we need to place 9 more flags.\n\nBut how to proceed. Let's look for a cell that must be a bomb based on the numbers. For example, the cell (7,4) is unexplored. Let's see if it must be a bomb. The cell (6,4) is 3. Adjacent to (6,4) are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The flag at (5,4) is one bomb. The cell (5,5) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,4). The cell (5,3) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,4). So the 3 at (6,4) needs two more bombs. The adjacent unexplored cells are (7,4) and (7,5). So those two must be bombs. But wait, 3 - 1 (existing flag) = 2, so two bombs needed. Therefore, (7,4) and (7,5) must be bombs. But can we confirm this?\n\nIf (7,4) and (7,5) are bombs, then the cell (7,3) which is 2 would have two bombs (at (7,4) and possibly another). Wait, the cell (7,3) is 2. Its adjacent cells are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). If (7,4) is a bomb, then the 2 at (7,3) would need one more bomb. The other adjacent unexplored cell is (8,4). So (8,4) must be a bomb. But then the cell (8,3) is 2. Its adjacent cells include (7,4) and (8,4), which would be two bombs, satisfying the 2. So that fits.\n\nBut how does this affect other cells? For example, the cell (6,5) is 3. Its adjacent cells include (5,4) (flagged), (5,5) (1), (5,6) (1), (6,4) (3), (6,6) (2), (7,4) (bomb), (7,5) (bomb), (7,6) (unexplored). So the 3 at (6,5) would have two bombs from (7,4) and (7,5), but that's only two, but the number is 3. Wait, that's a problem. Because (6,5) is 3, and if (7,4) and (7,5) are bombs, that's two bombs. Then there must be another bomb adjacent to (6,5). The other adjacent cells are (5,6) (1), which is already satisfied by its own adjacent cells. So where is the third bomb for (6,5)?\n\nAh, this is a conflict. If (6,5) is 3, and we have two bombs at (7,4) and (7,5), then there must be another bomb in the adjacent cells. The other adjacent cells are (5,4) (flagged), (5,5) (1), (5,6) (1), (6,4) (3), (6,6) (2), (7,6) (unexplored). The only unexplored cell here is (7,6). So (7,6) must be a bomb. But then the cell (6,6) is 2. Its adjacent cells include (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). If (7,5) and (7,6) are bombs, then the 2 at (6,6) would have two bombs, which is correct. So that works.\n\nSo, according to this, (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are bombs. But wait, (6,5) is 3, and those three bombs would be (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). But (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5), so that's three bombs. But (6,5) is 3, so that's correct. But then the cell (7,5) is adjacent to (6,5) and (7,6). But how does that affect other numbers?\n\nThis seems plausible, but how can we confirm this? If these cells are bombs, then we can flag them. But since we have 9 flags remaining, and we need to place 9 more flags, this could be a way to proceed. However, we need to make sure that placing these flags doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be safely revealed. For example, the cell (7,5) is adjacent to (6,5) which is 3. If we assume that (7,4) and (7,5) are bombs, then (7,5) is a bomb. But how do we know for sure? Maybe there's another way to deduce.\n\nWait, let's look at the cell (6,6) which is 2. Adjacent cells include (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). The cell (6,5) is 3, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is 1. If (7,5) and (7,6) are bombs, then the 2 at (6,6) is satisfied. That works. So this seems consistent.\n\nBut how to proceed. If we can confirm that (7,4) and (7,5) are bombs, we can flag them. But according to the rules, we need to verify that placing flags doesn't conflict with existing numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be safely revealed. For example, the cell (7,5) is unexplored. If we reveal it and it's a bomb, the game ends. But if it's safe, then our previous assumption is wrong. But we need to find a safe move.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a cell that is definitely safe. Let's look at the cell (4,5) which is 2. Adjacent cells are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). The cell (5,4) is flagged (F), which is one bomb. The cell (5,5) is 1, which is satisfied by (5,4). The cell (5,6) is 1, which must have one bomb adjacent. The adjacent cells to (5,6) are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). The cell (4,5) is 2, (4,6) is 1, (5,5) is 1. So the 1 at (5,6) must have one bomb in its adjacent cells. The unexplored cells are (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So one of those must be a bomb. But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 6, column 6 is 2. Adjacent cells include (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). The cell (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is 1, (6,5) is 3. The unexplored cells are (5,7), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). The 2 at (6,6) needs two bombs. If (7,5) and (7,6) are bombs, that would satisfy it. But again, this is assuming those are bombs.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Let's try to find a cell that can be safely revealed based on existing numbers and flags.\n\nLooking back at row 5, column 2 is empty. The cell (5,2) is empty, so all adjacent bombs are accounted for. The cell (5,1) is 1. The adjacent cells to (5,1) are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). The cell (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1, (5,2) is empty, (6,1) is 1, (6,2) is empty. The unexplored cells here are (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). The 1 at (5,1) must have exactly one bomb in these unexplored cells. But since there are three unexplored cells, we can't determine which one is the bomb. So this area isn't helpful.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are adjacent to multiple numbers which can be satisfied by a single bomb. For example, if a cell is adjacent to two numbers that both require a bomb in that cell, then it must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at cell (7,4). It's adjacent to (6,4) which is 3, (6,5) which is 3, and (7,3) which is 2. If (7,4) is a bomb, it would contribute to all three of these numbers. Let's see:\n\n- (6,4) needs two more bombs (since one is flagged at (5,4)), so (7,4) would be one of them.\n- (6,5) needs three bombs. If (7,4) is one, then two more are needed (like (7,5) and (7,6)).\n- (7,3) needs two bombs. If (7,4) is one, then another is needed at (8,4).\n\nThis seems plausible, but how to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be safely revealed. For example, the cell (7,5) is adjacent to (6,5) which is 3. If we assume that (7,4) and (7,5) are bombs, then revealing (7,5) would be a bomb, which would end the game. So that's risky. But if we can find a cell that is definitely safe, that's the way to go.\n\nWait, let's look at the cell (6,7). It's unexplored. The cell (6,6) is 2. Adjacent to (6,6) are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). The 2 at (6,6) needs two bombs. If (7,5) and (7,6) are bombs, then (6,7) could be safe. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother idea: check the cell (8,4). It's unexplored. The cell (8,3) is 2. Adjacent cells to (8,3) are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). The cell (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is unexplored. If (7,4) is a bomb, then (8,4) must also be a bomb to satisfy the 2 at (8,3). But again, this is assuming (7,4) is a bomb.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let's try to find a cell that is definitely safe based on the current information.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 3 is 1. The cell (9,3) is 1. Adjacent cells are (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4) \u2014 but since the board is 10x10, row 10 doesn't exist. So the adjacent cells are (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4). The cell (8,3) is 2, (8,2) is empty, (9,2) is empty. The unexplored cells are (8,4) and (9,4). The 1 at (9,3) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. The only possible unexplored cells are (8,4) and (9,4). So one of those must be a bomb. But without more info, we can't determine which.\n\nAnother angle: the cell (7,7) is unexplored. But there's no number adjacent to it that gives info.\n\nWait, let's go back to the cell (7,4). If we assume it's a bomb, then we can flag it. But we need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with any existing numbers. Let's check:\n\n- (6,4) is 3. If we flag (7,4), then the remaining bombs needed for (6,4) would be one more (since (5,4) is already flagged and (7,4) is now flagged). But (6,4) is 3, so 3 bombs needed. (5,4) is one, (7,4) is another, so one more needed. That would have to be (7,5). But then (6,5) is 3, which would have three bombs: (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). But (5,4) is adjacent to (6,5)? Let me check. The cell (6,5) is adjacent to (5,4) (yes), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). So (5,4) is adjacent to (6,5). So if (5,4) is flagged, and (7,4) and (7,5) are bombs, then (6,5) would have three bombs: (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). That matches its number 3. So that works.\n\nBut placing a flag at (7,4) would require that the other adjacent numbers are satisfied. For example, the cell (7,3) is 2. If (7,4) is a bomb, then another bomb is needed at (8,4). But (8,4) is unexplored. So placing a flag at (7,4) would leave the 2 at (7,3) needing another bomb at (8,4). But we can't confirm that yet. However, according to the rules, each number must have exactly the number of bombs adjacent. So if we place a flag at (7,4), we need to ensure that the other numbers are still possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (8,4) must be a bomb. Let's see. The cell (8,3) is 2. If (7,4) is a bomb, then (8,4) must also be a bomb to satisfy (8,3)'s 2. But (8,4) is unexplored. So if we flag (7,4), then we must also flag (8,4) to satisfy (8,3). But we can't do that yet without more info.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Let's try to find a cell that can be safely revealed based on existing information.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 5 is unexplored. The cell (7,5) is adjacent to (6,5) which is 3. If (7,5) is a bomb, then the 3 at (6,5) would have two bombs (assuming (7,4) is also a bomb). But that's not enough. So maybe (7,5) is safe. But this is risky.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a number which has exactly as many unexplored cells as needed. For example, if a number has N unexplored cells and needs exactly N bombs, then all those unexplored cells must be bombs.\n\nLooking at the cell (7,3) which is 2. Adjacent unexplored cells are (7,4) and (8,4). So two unexplored cells. The number is 2. So both must be bombs. Therefore, (7,4) and (8,4) must be bombs. This is a key insight. Because the cell (7,3) is 2, and there are exactly two unexplored cells adjacent to it, those two must be bombs. Therefore, we can flag both (7,4) and (8,4).\n\nBut we have to check if this conflicts with other numbers. For example, the cell (6,4) is 3. Adjacent bombs would be (5,4) (flagged), (7,4) (to be flagged), and (7,5) (unexplored). But (6,4) needs three bombs. So if (7,4) is flagged, then we need two more bombs. But the only other unexplored cell adjacent to (6,4) is (7,5). So that would mean (7,5) must also be a bomb. But then the cell (6,5) is 3, which would have bombs at (5,4), (7,4), and (7,5), totaling three, which matches. So this works.\n\nSo, based on the cell (7,3) being 2 with two unexplored adjacent cells, those two must be bombs. Therefore, (7,4) and (8,4) are bombs. We can flag them. But we have to check if this is allowed.\n\nBut wait, the cell (8,4) is adjacent to (8,3) which is 2. If we flag (8,4), then the 2 at (8,3) would have one bomb (at (8,4)), and another bomb needed. The adjacent cells to (8,3) are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). If (7,4) and (8,4) are flagged, then the 2 at (8,3) would have two bombs (assuming (7,4) is adjacent). Wait, (7,4) is adjacent to (8,3)? Let me check. The cell (8,3) is at row 8, column 3. Adjacent cells include (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). So (7,4) is adjacent to (8,3). So if (7,4) and (8,4) are flagged, then the 2 at (8,3) would have two bombs: (7,4) and (8,4). That satisfies its number. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, (7,4) and (8,4) must be bombs. We can flag them. But we have to check if there are any conflicts.\n\nAdditionally, the cell (6,4) is 3. Adjacent bombs would be (5,4) (flagged), (7,4) (to be flagged), and (7,5) (unexplored). So (6,4) needs one more bomb. Therefore, (7,5) must also be a bomb. But how do we know that?\n\nThe cell (6,5) is 3. Adjacent bombs would be (5,4) (flagged), (7,4) (to be flagged), and (7,5) (to be flagged). So that's three bombs, which matches the number 3. So (7,5) must be a bomb as well. But how to confirm this.\n\nThe cell (6,5) is 3. Adjacent unexplored cells are (7,5) and (7,6). So if (7,5) is a bomb, then (7,6) must also be a bomb to satisfy the 3 at (6,5). But wait, (6,5) is 3, and if (5,4), (7,4), and (7,5) are bombs, that's three bombs. So (7,5) must be a bomb. Therefore, (7,5) is a bomb.\n\nBut how to confirm this. The cell (7,5) is adjacent to (6,5) (3), (6,6) (2), and (7,6) (unexplored). If (7,5) is a bomb, then the 2 at (6,6) would have one bomb (at (7,5)), needing another. The adjacent unexplored cell is (7,6). So (7,6) must be a bomb. But then the cell (6,6) is 2, which would have two bombs: (7,5) and (7,6). That works.\n\nSo, based on the initial deduction from (7,3) being 2 with two unexplored cells, we can flag (7,4) and (8,4). Then, from (6,4) being 3, we need to flag (7,5). Then, from (6,5) being 3, we need to flag (7,5) and (7,6). But this is getting into a chain of deductions.\n\nHowever, the first step is to flag (7,4) and (8,4) because they are the only possible bombs adjacent to (7,3). Let's start with that.\n\nBut according to the rules, we need to place flags only when we're certain. So the cell (7,3) is 2 with two unexplored cells adjacent. Therefore, those two must be bombs. So we can safely flag (7,4) and (8,4).\n\nBut the user can only make one move at a time. So which one to choose first.\n\nThe cell (7,4) is adjacent to (6,4) which is 3. Flagging (7,4) would help satisfy that number. So perhaps flagging (7,4) first.\n\nBut let's check the number of flags remaining. Currently, there's one flag placed (at (5,4)), and the flags remaining are 9. So we can place 9 more flags. Flagging (7,4) would use one of them, leaving 8.\n\nSo the move would be to place a flag at (7,4).\n\nBut wait, let's verify again. The cell (7,3) is 2. Adjacent unexplored cells are (7,4) and (8,4). Therefore, both must be bombs. So placing a flag at (7,4) is correct.\n\nYes, this seems like a valid move. Therefore, the next move should be to place a flag at (7,4).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (7,3) is a 2 with exactly two unexplored adjacent cells (7,4) and (8,4). According to the rules, these must both be bombs. Placing a flag at (7,4) satisfies this condition and aligns with the remaining flags available.\n\nMOVE: 7,4,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . 1 1 2 2 1 1 . . .\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . . .\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 . . .\n7 . 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n8 . 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n9 . 1 _ 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 7, "y": 5, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at the Minesweeper board provided. The goal is to figure out the next move, either placing a flag or revealing a tile, without hitting a bomb. Let's start by analyzing the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, the board is mostly unexplored except for the lower middle section. Let's focus on the revealed numbers and flags. The game info says there are 10 bombs and 8 flags remaining. So, 8 flags have already been placed, but according to the board, I can see one flag at (5,4). Wait, the board shows F at (5,4). So that's one flag. But the flags remaining are 8. That means there are 8 flags left to place, which implies that one flag has already been placed. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . . . \n\nSo at (5,4) there's an F. So that's one flag. The flags remaining are 8, which means the total bombs are 10, so 10 flags need to be placed. But the user says Flags remaining: 8. So total flags placed so far would be 10 - 8 = 2? Wait, no. Wait, the flags remaining is the number of flags left to place. So if the game has 10 bombs, and you start with 10 flags. If you have 8 remaining, that means 2 flags have been placed. But on the board, I only see one F. Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Wait, maybe the user made a typo, but according to the given info, Flags remaining: 8, so the user has placed 10 - 8 = 2 flags. But on the board, there's only one F. That suggests that maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm missing another flag. Let me check all the rows again.\n\nLooking at row 7: . 1 _ 2 F . . . . . \n\nWait, row 7 has an F at (7,4). So that's another flag. So (5,4) and (7,4) are both flagged. So two flags in total. That matches with the flags remaining being 8 (since 10 bombs, 10 - 8 = 2 flags placed). Okay, that makes sense now. So two flags are already placed.\n\nNow, let's look at the numbers and see where we can deduce safe moves or necessary flags.\n\nStarting with the cells that have numbers. Let's check each number to see if their adjacent flags satisfy the count.\n\nFor example, let's look at cell (5,1) which is a 1. The adjacent cells would be the 8 surrounding cells. Let's check if any flags are adjacent. The cell (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. The adjacent cells would be:\n\n(4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n(5,0),      (5,2)\n(6,0), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 4: . 1 1 2 2 1 1 . . . \n\nSo (4,0) is ., unexplored. (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1. (5,0) is ., (5,2) is _. (6,0) is ., (6,1) is 1, (6,2) is _. So the 1 at (5,1) has no adjacent flags. Therefore, there must be exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. But since there are no flags nearby, all adjacent unexplored cells could potentially be bombs. But we can't place a flag here yet without more info.\n\nNext, let's check cell (5,3) which is a 1. Adjacent cells would be:\n\n(4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n(5,2),      (5,4)\n(6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nLooking at these:\n\n(4,2) is 1 (so not a flag), (4,3) is 2, (4,4) is 2. (5,2) is _, (5,4) is F (flag). (6,2) is _, (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3. So the cell (5,3) is a 1, and there's a flag at (5,4). So the 1 at (5,3) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since there's already a flag at (5,4), which is adjacent, that counts as one bomb. Therefore, all other adjacent cells must be safe. Let's check which cells are adjacent and unexplored.\n\nAdjacent cells to (5,3):\n\n(4,2) is 1 (revealed), (4,3) is 2 (revealed), (4,4) is 2 (revealed). (5,2) is _ (revealed empty), (5,4) is F. (6,2) is _ (empty), (6,3) is 2 (revealed), (6,4) is 3 (revealed). So all adjacent cells except (5,4) are either revealed or empty. Wait, but (5,4) is a flag. So the 1 at (5,3) is satisfied by the flag at (5,4). Therefore, the other adjacent cells must be safe. But looking at the adjacent cells, are there any unexplored ones? Let's see:\n\nThe cells around (5,3) that are adjacent and possibly unexplored: (4,2) is 1, (4,3) is 2, (4,4) is 2, (5,2) is _, (5,4) is F, (6,2) is _, (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3. So all adjacent cells are either revealed or flagged. So no action needed here.\n\nNext, let's look at cell (6,1) which is a 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(5,0), (5,1), (5,2)\n(6,0),      (6,2)\n(7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\nLooking at these:\n\nRow 5: (5,0) is ., (5,1) is 1, (5,2) is _.\nRow 6: (6,0) is ., (6,2) is _.\nRow 7: (7,0) is ., (7,1) is 1, (7,2) is _.\n\nSo the 1 at (6,1) has adjacent cells (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2). Among these, (5,1) is 1, (5,2) is _, (6,2) is _, (7,1) is 1, (7,2) is _. The rest are unexplored (dots). So the 1 at (6,1) requires exactly one bomb in these adjacent cells. But there are no flags nearby. So the bomb could be in any of the unexplored cells. Not helpful yet.\n\nLooking at cell (6,3) which is a 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(5,2), (5,3), (5,4)\n(6,2),      (6,4)\n(7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\n(5,2) is _, (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is F. (6,2) is _, (6,4) is 3. (7,2) is _, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is F. So the 2 at (6,3) has two flags adjacent: (5,4) and (7,4). Wait, (5,4) is F and (7,4) is F. So that's two flags. But the number is 2, which matches. So that's correct. So no conflict here.\n\nNow, cell (6,4) is a 3. Adjacent cells:\n\n(5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n(6,3),      (6,5)\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5)\n\n(5,3) is 1, (5,4) is F, (5,5) is 1. (6,3) is 2, (6,5) is 3. (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is F, (7,5) is . (unexplored). So the 3 at (6,4) has two flags adjacent (F at (5,4) and (7,4)). So two bombs accounted for. The number is 3, so there must be one more bomb in the remaining adjacent cells. The remaining cells are (5,3) is 1 (safe), (5,5) is 1 (safe), (6,3) is 2 (safe), (6,5) is 3 (safe), (7,3) is 2 (safe), (7,5) is . (unexplored). So the only unexplored cell adjacent to (6,4) is (7,5). Therefore, (7,5) must be a bomb. So we can place a flag there. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nBut wait, the cell (7,5) is currently unexplored (.). If we place a flag there, that would account for the third bomb needed for (6,4). Let's verify. The 3 at (6,4) requires three bombs. Two are already flagged at (5,4) and (7,4). So the third must be at (7,5). Therefore, (7,5) is a bomb. So we should flag (7,5).\n\nBut before doing that, we need to check if placing a flag there conflicts with any other numbers. Let's look at adjacent cells to (7,5). The adjacent cells would be:\n\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n(7,4),      (7,6)\n(8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\n(6,4) is 3, (6,5) is 3, (6,6) is 2. (7,4) is F, (7,6) is . (unexplored). (8,4) is 2, (8,5) is ., (8,6) is . So if we place a flag at (7,5), how does that affect the numbers around it?\n\nLooking at (6,5) which is a 3. The adjacent cells to (6,5) are:\n\n(5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n(6,4),      (6,6)\n(7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n(5,4) is F, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is 1. (6,4) is 3, (6,6) is 2. (7,4) is F, (7,5) would be F (if we place it), (7,6) is . So the 3 at (6,5) would have two flags (F at (5,4) and F at (7,4)), and if we place F at (7,5), that's a third flag. But the number is 3, so that's correct. Wait, but (6,5) is a 3. So if there are three flags adjacent, that's correct. But wait, (5,4) is F, (7,4) is F, and (7,5) would be F. Are all three adjacent to (6,5)? Let's check:\n\n(5,4) is adjacent to (6,5)? (6,5) is row 6, column 5. (5,4) is row 5, column 4. Yes, diagonally adjacent. Similarly, (7,4) is adjacent (row 7, column 4) to (6,5) (row 6, column 5) \u2014 diagonally adjacent. (7,5) is directly below (6,5), so adjacent. So yes, all three are adjacent. So if we place a flag at (7,5), then (6,5)'s count would be 3, which matches the number. So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, the cell (6,5) is a 3. If we place a flag at (7,5), then the three flags (5,4), (7,4), and (7,5) would account for three bombs. That's correct. So no conflict here.\n\nAnother cell to check is (7,3) which is a 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n(7,2),      (7,4)\n(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)\n\n(6,2) is _, (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3. (7,2) is _, (7,4) is F. (8,2) is _, (8,3) is 2, (8,4) is 2. The 2 at (7,3) has one flag at (7,4). So it needs one more bomb. The adjacent unexplored cells are (6,2), (7,2), (8,2). But if we place a flag at (7,5), that doesn't affect (7,3). So no conflict there.\n\nAnother cell to check is (8,4) which is a 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5)\n(8,3),      (8,5)\n(9,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\n(7,3) is 2, (7,4) is F, (7,5) would be F (if we place it). (8,3) is 2, (8,5) is . (unexplored). (9,3) is 1, (9,4) is ., (9,5) is . So the 2 at (8,4) has two flags adjacent: (7,4) and (7,5) (if we place it). Wait, (7,5) is adjacent to (8,4)? Let's see: (8,4) is row 8, column 4. (7,5) is row 7, column 5. That's diagonally adjacent. So yes. So if we place a flag at (7,5), then (8,4) would have two flags adjacent (F at (7,4) and F at (7,5)). But (8,4) is a 2, which would be correct. So that's okay.\n\nSo placing a flag at (7,5) seems valid. Let's check if there are any other cells that would be affected. For example, (7,5) is adjacent to (6,5) (which we checked), (7,4) (already flagged), and (8,5) (unexplored). The cell (8,5) is unexplored, but placing a flag at (7,5) doesn't affect any numbers around it yet.\n\nSo based on the analysis, (7,5) must be a bomb because the 3 at (6,4) requires three bombs, and two are already flagged, so the third must be at (7,5). Therefore, placing a flag there is the correct move.\n\nAnother possible area to check is row 7, column 3 (cell (7,3)) which is a 2. Adjacent cells include (7,4) which is flagged. So the 2 needs one more bomb. The adjacent unexplored cells are (6,2), (7,2), (8,2). But without more info, we can't determine which one is the bomb. So we can't place a flag there yet.\n\nAnother point to consider is the cell (5,5) which is a 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n(5,4),      (5,6)\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(4,4) is 2, (4,5) is 2, (4,6) is 1. (5,4) is F, (5,6) is 1. (6,4) is 3, (6,5) is 3, (6,6) is 2. The 1 at (5,5) has one adjacent flag at (5,4). So that satisfies the 1, meaning all other adjacent cells are safe. But all adjacent cells are already revealed except (5,6) which is 1, so no action needed here.\n\nLooking at cell (7,4) which is flagged. The cell (7,4) is adjacent to (6,3) (2), (6,4) (3), (6,5) (3), (7,3) (2), (7,5) (.), (8,3) (2), (8,4) (2), (8,5) (.). The flag here is accounted for in those numbers, so no conflict.\n\nAnother area to check is row 8, column 3 (cell (8,3)) which is a 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n(8,2),      (8,4)\n(9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n\n(7,2) is _, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is F. (8,2) is _, (8,4) is 2. (9,2) is _, (9,3) is 1, (9,4) is .. The 2 at (8,3) has one flag at (7,4). So it needs one more bomb. The possible cells are (7,2), (8,2), (9,2), (9,4). But without more info, can't determine which.\n\nBack to the main point: the cell (6,4) is a 3 with two adjacent flags. The third must be at (7,5). So placing a flag there is necessary. Let's confirm that there are no other possibilities. The adjacent cells to (6,4) are:\n\n(5,3) is 1, (5,4) is F, (5,5) is 1, (6,3) is 2, (6,5) is 3, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is F, (7,5) is .. So the only unexplored cell is (7,5). Therefore, (7,5) must be a bomb. So placing a flag there is correct.\n\nAnother check: the cell (6,5) is a 3. Adjacent cells include (5,4) F, (5,5) 1, (5,6) 1, (6,4) 3, (6,6) 2, (7,4) F, (7,5) (to be flagged), (7,6) .. So if we flag (7,5), then (6,5) has three flags adjacent: (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). That's three, which matches the 3. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be to place a flag at (7,5). Let's also check the number of flags remaining. Currently, there are two flags placed (at (5,4) and (7,4)). Flags remaining are 8, so placing another flag would leave 7 remaining, which is allowed since there are 10 bombs total. So this is valid.\n\nAnother possible move could be revealing a safe tile. For example, looking at cell (5,5) which is a 1. Adjacent cells have one flag (at (5,4)), so other cells are safe. But all adjacent cells are already revealed. So no action there.\n\nAlternatively, looking at cell (7,5) again. If we place a flag there, that's correct. So the move would be x=7, y=5, flag=true.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (6,4) is a 3 with two adjacent flags (5,4 and 7,4). The third bomb must be at (7,5) to satisfy the count. Placing a flag here is necessary and doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nMOVE: 7,5,true", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . 1 1 2 2 1 1 . . .\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . . .\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 . . .\n7 . 1 _ 2 F . . . . .\n8 . 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n9 . 1 _ 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 8, "y": 4, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at the Minesweeper board provided. The goal is to figure out the next safe move. Let me start by analyzing the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 7 flags remaining with 10 bombs in total. So, 10 bombs minus the flags already placed. Let me check where the existing flags are. Looking at the board, there's an F at (5,4), (7,4), and (7,5). Wait, let me count again. Row 5, column 4 is F. Then row 7, columns 4 and 5 are F. So that's three flags placed so far. Since the total bombs are 10, and flags remaining are 7, that means 3 flags have been placed (10 - 7 = 3). So that matches the F's I see on the board. So those three are correctly accounted for.\n\nNow, let's look at the revealed numbers and see if there are any obvious places to flag or reveal. Let's start from the bottom rows where there are more revealed numbers.\n\nLooking at row 7: cells (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is F, (7,5) is F. The cell (7,3) is a 2. The adjacent cells around (7,3) would be the 8 surrounding cells. Let's check which of those are already flagged or have numbers. The cell (7,3) is in row 7, column 3. The adjacent cells would be:\n\nRow 6: columns 2,3,4\nRow 7: columns 2,4\nRow 8: columns 2,3,4\n\nBut looking at the board:\n\nRow 6: (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3, (6,5) is 3. So those are numbers. The cell (7,3) is 2. The adjacent cells to (7,3) that are unexplored or flagged: Let's see. The cell (7,4) is F, which is adjacent. So that's one bomb accounted for. The cell (7,3) is 2, so there should be two bombs adjacent. Since there's already one flag at (7,4), there must be another bomb adjacent. Let's check the other adjacent cells. The cell (6,4) is 3, which is adjacent to (7,3). But (6,4) is already a 3. Wait, maybe the other adjacent cells. Let's list all adjacent cells to (7,3):\n\n- (6,2): row 6, column 2. Looking at row 6, column 2 is '_', which is empty revealed. So that's safe.\n- (6,3): 2, already revealed.\n- (6,4): 3, revealed.\n- (7,2): '_', empty.\n- (7,4): F, flagged.\n- (8,2): '_', empty.\n- (8,3): 2, revealed.\n- (8,4): '.' unexplored.\n\nWait, (8,4) is unexplored. So (7,3) has a 2, with one flag at (7,4). The remaining adjacent cells that are unexplored: (8,4). So that cell (8,4) must be a bomb. Because the 2 at (7,3) requires two bombs, and only one is flagged. So (8,4) should be a bomb. Let me check if that's possible. But wait, (8,4) is in row 8, column 4. Let's look at the board for row 8. Row 8 is: . 1 _ 2 . . . . . . So row 8, column 4 is '.' (unexplored). So that's a candidate for a flag. But before placing a flag there, I need to check if that's consistent with other numbers.\n\nWait, let's check the cell (8,3), which is 2. The cell (8,3) is 2. Its adjacent cells would include (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). Let's see:\n\n- (7,2) is '_', empty.\n- (7,3) is 2.\n- (7,4) is F (flagged).\n- (8,2) is '_'.\n- (8,4) is '.'.\n- (9,2) is '_'.\n- (9,3) is 1.\n- (9,4) is '.'.\n\nSo the 2 at (8,3) has one adjacent flag at (7,4). So it needs another bomb. The possible unexplored cells adjacent to (8,3) are (8,4) and (9,4). If (8,4) is a bomb, then that would satisfy the 2 at (8,3). But also, the cell (7,3) would have its second bomb at (8,4). So that seems possible. But let's check if there's any conflict.\n\nAnother angle: the cell (6,4) is 3. Let's check its adjacent cells. (6,4) is 3. Adjacent cells would include:\n\nRow 5: columns 3,4,5\nRow 6: columns 3,5\nRow 7: columns 3,4,5\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4 is F (flagged). So that's one bomb. Then, (7,4) is F, which is adjacent to (6,4). Wait, (6,4) is 3. So the adjacent cells would be (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). Let's list them:\n\n- (5,3): 1\n- (5,4): F (flagged)\n- (5,5): 1\n- (6,3): 2\n- (6,5): 3\n- (7,3): 2\n- (7,4): F (flagged)\n- (7,5): F (flagged)\n\nSo the 3 at (6,4) has three adjacent flags: (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). Wait, but (5,4) is F, (7,4) is F, (7,5) is F. That's three flags. But the number is 3. So that's correct. So those three flags account for the three bombs adjacent to (6,4). So that's okay. So no conflict there.\n\nNow, back to (7,3) and (8,3). If we place a flag at (8,4), then (7,3)'s 2 would be satisfied (with F at (7,4) and (8,4)), and (8,3)'s 2 would also be satisfied (with F at (7,4) and (8,4)). But wait, (8,3) is adjacent to (7,4) and (8,4). So if (8,4) is a bomb, then (8,3) would have two bombs: (7,4) and (8,4). That's correct. So that seems valid.\n\nBut wait, let's check if (8,4) is adjacent to any other numbers. For example, (8,4) is adjacent to (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). Let's see:\n\n- (7,3) is 2, which we've considered.\n- (7,4) is F.\n- (7,5) is F.\n- (8,3) is 2.\n- (8,5) is '.' (unexplored).\n- (9,3) is 1.\n- (9,4) is '.'.\n- (9,5) is '.'.\n\nSo if we place a flag at (8,4), how does that affect (9,3), which is 1. The cell (9,3) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2), etc. But since the board is 10x10, row 9 is the last row. So (9,3)'s adjacent cells are:\n\n- (8,2): '_'\n- (8,3): 2\n- (8,4): '.' (if we flag this, then (9,3) would have a bomb adjacent)\n- (9,2): '_'\n- (9,4): '.' \n- (10,2): out of bounds\n- etc.\n\nWait, (9,3) is 1. If (8,4) is a bomb, then (9,3) would have that bomb adjacent. But (9,3) is 1. Are there any other flags adjacent to (9,3)? Let's check. The adjacent cells to (9,3) are:\n\nRow 8: columns 2,3,4\nRow 9: columns 2,4\n\nLooking at row 8, column 2 is '_', column 3 is 2, column 4 is '.' (unexplored). Row 9, column 2 is '_', column 4 is '.'.\n\nSo currently, (9,3) has no adjacent flags. If we place a flag at (8,4), then (9,3) would have one adjacent bomb. That's okay because (9,3) is 1. So that's acceptable. So placing a flag at (8,4) would satisfy both (7,3) and (8,3), and not conflict with (9,3).\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's another possible bomb location. For example, (8,4) is a candidate, but maybe (8,5) is another. But (8,3) is 2, and (7,4) is already a flag. So (8,3) needs one more bomb. The possible cells are (8,4) and (8,5) and (9,4). But (8,5) is unexplored. However, (8,3) is adjacent to (8,4) and (9,4). If (8,4) is a bomb, that's one. But (9,4) is '.' and adjacent to (9,3) which is 1. If (9,4) is a bomb, then (9,3) would have two bombs adjacent, which is a problem because (9,3) is 1. So (9,4) can't be a bomb. Therefore, the only possible bomb for (8,3) is (8,4). So that's the correct spot.\n\nTherefore, placing a flag at (8,4) seems correct. Let's check if that's allowed. The flags remaining are 7, so we can place a flag here. But wait, the current flags are 3 (at 5,4; 7,4; 7,5). Placing a flag at (8,4) would use one of the remaining 7, so flags remaining would become 6. That's okay.\n\nBut before placing the flag, I need to make sure that there's no conflict with other numbers. Let's check other adjacent cells. For example, (7,5) is F. The cell (7,5) is adjacent to (6,4) which is 3. As we saw earlier, (6,4) has three flags around it, which is correct. So no problem there.\n\nAnother check: the cell (8,4) is adjacent to (7,3) (2), (8,3) (2), and (9,3) (1). If we place a flag here, then (7,3) and (8,3) are satisfied, and (9,3) is also satisfied. So that's okay.\n\nSo the next move should be to place a flag at (8,4). But wait, let me check if there's any other possible moves that are safer. For example, maybe there's a cell that can be safely revealed.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 2 is '_', which is empty. Wait, row 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . . . So (5,2) is '_', which is already revealed. Hmm. Let's look for other cells that can be revealed based on existing numbers.\n\nFor example, the cell (6,2) is '_', which is empty. Let's check the cell (5,1) which is 1. The cell (5,1) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). Let's see:\n\n- (4,0): '.' unexplored\n- (4,1): 1\n- (4,2): 1\n- (5,0): '.' \n- (5,2): '_' (empty)\n- (6,0): '.' \n- (6,1): 1\n- (6,2): '_'\n\nSo the 1 at (5,1) has adjacent cells. The only possible bomb here would be in the unexplored cells. Let's see: (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). But (5,1) is 1. Are there any flags adjacent to (5,1)? No. So the bomb could be in any of those three cells. But since it's a 1, only one of them is a bomb. But without more info, we can't determine which. So maybe that's not a safe move.\n\nAnother area: look at row 6, column 5 is 3. Let's check adjacent cells. The cell (6,5) is 3. Adjacent cells include (5,4) which is F, (5,5) which is 1, (5,6) which is 1, (6,4) which is 3, (6,6) which is 2, (7,4) which is F, (7,5) which is F, (7,6) which is '.'.\n\nSo (6,5) is 3. The adjacent flags are (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). That's three flags, which matches the number 3. So that's correct. So no conflict here.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 6 is '.' (unexplored). The cell (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5) (3), (6,6) (2), (7,5) (F), (8,5) (.), (8,6) (.), etc. But since (6,6) is 2, let's check that. The cell (6,6) is 2. Adjacent cells include (5,5) (1), (5,6) (1), (5,7) (.), (6,5) (3), (6,7) (.), (7,5) (F), (7,6) (.), (7,7) (.). So the 2 at (6,6) has one adjacent flag at (7,5). So there must be another bomb adjacent. The possible cells are (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7). But without more info, it's hard to tell. So maybe not a safe move here.\n\nAnother possible area: row 8, column 4 is '.' (unexplored), which we considered earlier. Placing a flag there seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be safely revealed.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 4 is '.' (unexplored). The cell (9,3) is 1. Adjacent cells include (8,2) '_', (8,3) 2, (8,4) '.', (9,2) '_', (9,4) '.', (9,5) '.', etc. Since (9,3) is 1, there must be exactly one bomb adjacent. The unexplored cells are (8,4), (9,4), (9,5). If we place a flag at (8,4), then (9,3) would have one bomb, which is correct. But if (8,4) is not a bomb, then the bomb must be in (9,4) or (9,5). But (9,4) is adjacent to (9,3) and (8,4). If (9,4) is a bomb, then (9,3) is satisfied, but (8,4) would need to be considered in other cells. However, given the earlier analysis, (8,4) seems to be the correct bomb location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be revealed safely. For example, the cell (8,5) is '.' and adjacent to (7,5) which is F. Let's see. The cell (7,5) is F. The cell (7,5) is part of the 3 at (6,4). So that's accounted for. The cell (8,5) is adjacent to (7,5) (F), (7,6) (.), (8,4) (.), (8,6) (.), (9,4) (.), (9,5) (.), (9,6) (.). Not sure if that's safe.\n\nAnother possible safe move: look for cells that have all their bombs accounted for. For example, the cell (6,1) is 1. Let's check adjacent cells. (6,1) is 1. Adjacent cells include (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2). Let's see:\n\n- (5,0): '.' unexplored\n- (5,1): 1\n- (5,2): '_'\n- (6,0): '.' \n- (6,2): '_'\n- (7,0): '.' \n- (7,1): 1\n- (7,2): '_'\n\nSo the 1 at (6,1) has adjacent cells. The only unexplored cells are (5,0), (6,0), (7,0). But since it's a 1, there must be exactly one bomb among those. However, without more info, we can't determine which. So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: check if any numbers have all their bombs already flagged, allowing safe revealing of adjacent cells. For example, the cell (5,5) is 1. Let's check adjacent cells. (5,5) is 1. Adjacent cells include (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4) (F), (5,6) (1), (6,4) (3), (6,5) (3), (6,6) (2). The only unexplored cell adjacent to (5,5) is (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Wait, (5,5) is 1, and (5,4) is F. So the 1 at (5,5) already has one adjacent bomb (the flag at (5,4)). Therefore, all other adjacent cells must be safe. So the cells (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are adjacent. Wait, but (5,6) is 1, (6,4) is 3, etc. The unexplored cells adjacent to (5,5) are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Since (5,5) is 1 and already has a flag at (5,4), those three cells must be safe. So we can reveal them.\n\nWait, let's confirm. The cell (5,5) is 1. The adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,4): 2 (from the board: row 4, column 4 is 2)\n- (4,5): 2\n- (4,6): 1\n- (5,4): F\n- (5,6): 1\n- (6,4): 3\n- (6,5): 3\n- (6,6): 2\n\nWait, looking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 4: . 1 1 2 2 1 1 . . . \n\nSo row 4, columns 4,5,6 are 2,2,1. So (4,4) is 2, (4,5) is 2, (4,6) is 1. So those are already revealed. Therefore, all adjacent cells to (5,5) are either revealed or flagged. So the 1 at (5,5) has one adjacent flag (at (5,4)), which satisfies its count. Therefore, there are no unexplored cells adjacent to (5,5). So that's not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's look elsewhere. The cell (4,4) is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (4,4) is 2. Adjacent cells include (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). All of these are revealed except maybe (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). But row 3 is all '.' unexplored. So (4,4) is 2, but the adjacent unexplored cells are in row 3. But since row 3 is all unexplored, we can't do much there.\n\nAnother possible move: look at the cell (5,3) which is 1. Adjacent cells include (4,2) (1), (4,3) (2), (4,4) (2), (5,2) '_', (5,4) F, (6,2) '_', (6,3) 2, (6,4) 3. The 1 at (5,3) has one adjacent flag at (5,4). So all other adjacent cells must be safe. But all adjacent cells except (5,4) are either revealed or numbers. So no unexplored cells here.\n\nWait, maybe the cell (8,5) is unexplored. Let's check if there's a number that requires it to be safe. For example, the cell (7,6) is '.' unexplored. Adjacent to (7,6) are (6,5) (3), (6,6) (2), (6,7) (.), (7,5) (F), (7,7) (.), (8,5) (.), (8,6) (.), (8,7) (.). The cell (6,6) is 2. Adjacent to (6,6) are (5,5) (1), (5,6) (1), (5,7) (.), (6,5) (3), (6,7) (.), (7,5) (F), (7,6) (.), (7,7) (.). The 2 at (6,6) has one adjacent flag at (7,5). So there must be one more bomb adjacent. The unexplored cells are (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7). But without more info, can't determine.\n\nBack to the earlier thought: placing a flag at (8,4) seems like a valid move. Let's confirm again. The cell (7,3) is 2 with one adjacent flag (7,4). The cell (8,3) is 2 with one adjacent flag (7,4). So both need one more bomb. The only common unexplored cell adjacent to both is (8,4). Therefore, (8,4) must be a bomb. So placing a flag there is correct.\n\nAnother check: the cell (8,4) is adjacent to (9,3) which is 1. If we place a flag at (8,4), then (9,3) has one bomb adjacent, which is correct. So no conflict.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be to place a flag at (8,4).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (7,3) shows a 2 with one adjacent flag (7,4), and the cell at (8,3) also shows a 2 with one adjacent flag (7,4). The only unexplored cell adjacent to both is (8,4), which must be a bomb to satisfy both numbers. Placing a flag here is consistent with adjacent numbers and the remaining bomb count.\n\nMOVE: 8,4,true", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . 1 1 2 2 1 1 . . .\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . . .\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 . . .\n7 . 1 _ 2 F F . . . .\n8 . 1 _ 2 . . . . . .\n9 . 1 _ 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at the Minesweeper board provided. The goal is to figure out the next safe move. Let me start by analyzing the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. The flags remaining are 6, so 10-6=4 bombs are already flagged. Wait, no, the flags remaining count is how many are left to place. Wait, the GAME INFO says Flags remaining: 6, Bombs: 10. So that means there are 6 flags left to place, but the total bombs are 10. So, the user has already placed 10 - 6 = 4 flags. Let me check the board for existing flags.\n\nLooking at the board, the F's are at positions (5,4), (7,4), (7,5), (8,4). Wait, let me check each row:\n\nRow 5: F at (5,4)\nRow 7: F at (7,4) and (7,5)\nRow 8: F at (8,4)\nSo that's 4 flags placed. Which matches the calculation (10 bombs total, 6 flags remaining, so 4 flags already placed). So there are 6 more flags to place.\n\nNow, let's look at the revealed numbers and see where we can deduce safe moves or necessary flags.\n\nStarting from the bottom rows where there are revealed numbers. Let's check row 4 to row 9.\n\nRow 4: . 1 1 2 2 1 1 . . .\nRow 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . . .\nRow 6: . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 . . .\nRow 7: . 1 _ 2 F F . . . .\nRow 8: . 1 _ 2 F . . . . .\nRow 9: . 1 _ 1 . . . . . .\n\nLooking at row 5, position (5,4) is a flag. Let's check the adjacent numbers. The cell at (5,3) is 1. Since there's a flag at (5,4), that 1 must be satisfied by that flag. So the other adjacent cells around (5,3) should be safe. Let's see the adjacent cells to (5,3). The cell (5,3) is 1, and has a flag at (5,4). So the other cells around it (like (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (4,2)) should not have any bombs. Wait, but (5,3) is 1, and there's already a flag at (5,4), so all other adjacent cells are safe. Let's check if any of those are unexplored.\n\nLooking at (5,2): it's already revealed as empty (_). So that's safe. (4,3) is 2. (4,4) is 2. (6,3) is 2. (6,4) is 3. So those are all numbers. So maybe that's already accounted for.\n\nLooking at row 6, position (6,4) is 3. Let's check adjacent flags. The cells around (6,4) are:\n\n(5,3) 1, (5,4) F, (5,5) 1, (6,3) 2, (6,5) 3, (7,3) 2, (7,4) F, (7,5) F. Wait, (6,4) is 3. The adjacent flags are (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). Wait, (5,4) is F, (7,4) is F, (7,5) is F. So three flags adjacent to (6,4). But the number is 3. So that's correct. So no problem here.\n\nNow, looking at row 7, position (7,3) is 2. The adjacent cells include (6,2) which is _, (6,3) 2, (6,4) 3, (7,4) F, (8,3) 2, (8,4) F, (8,2) _, (7,2) _. So the 2 at (7,3) has two adjacent flags (7,4 and 8,4). Wait, (7,4) is F and (8,4) is F. So that's two flags. So the number 2 is satisfied. So the other adjacent cells should be safe. Let's check the cells around (7,3). The cells (7,2) is _, (8,2) is _, (8,3) is 2. So (7,2) and (8,2) are unexplored? Wait, no. Let me check the board again.\n\nRow 7: . 1 _ 2 F F . . . .\nSo (7,0) is ., (7,1) is 1, (7,2) is _, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) F, (7,5) F, then . onwards. So (7,2) is revealed as empty. So (7,2) is safe, (8,2) is in row 8: . 1 _ 2 F . . . . . So (8,2) is _, which is empty revealed? Wait, no. Wait, row 8 is: . (8,0), 1 (8,1), _ (8,2), 2 (8,3), F (8,4), . (8,5), etc. So (8,2) is _, which is an empty revealed space. So that's already safe. So maybe the 2 at (7,3) is already satisfied by the two flags. So no issues here.\n\nLooking at row 8, position (8,3) is 2. The adjacent cells include (7,2) _, (7,3) 2, (7,4) F, (8,4) F, (9,2) _, (9,3) 1, (9,4) ., (8,2) _. So the 2 at (8,3) has two adjacent flags (7,4 and 8,4). So that's two flags, which matches the number. So the other adjacent cells are safe. For example, (9,4) is ., which is unexplored. But (8,3) is 2 with two flags, so (9,4) should be safe. Wait, but (9,4) is adjacent to (8,3). Let me check the adjacent cells of (8,3):\n\nAdjacent cells would be (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). The two flags are at (7,4) and (8,4). So the 2 is satisfied. So (9,4) is adjacent to (8,3) but since the 2 is already covered by the two flags, (9,4) should be safe. But (9,4) is currently ., so maybe we can reveal that. But let's check if there's a more certain move.\n\nLooking at row 9: . 1 _ 1 . . . . . . So (9,1) is 1, (9,2) is _, (9,3) is 1. Let's check the 1 at (9,3). The adjacent cells would be (8,2) _, (8,3) 2, (8,4) F, (9,2) _, (9,4) ., (10 is out of bounds). The 1 at (9,3) has one adjacent flag at (8,4). So the 1 requires exactly one bomb. Since there's already a flag at (8,4), the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (9,4) is adjacent to (9,3) and is ., so (9,4) can be safely revealed. That's a possible move.\n\nAnother area to check is row 6, position (6,5) is 3. Let's see adjacent cells. The cells around (6,5) are (5,4) F, (5,5) 1, (5,6) 1, (6,4) 3, (6,6) 2, (7,4) F, (7,5) F, (7,6) . (since row 7, column 6 is .). The 3 at (6,5) has three adjacent flags: (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). So that's three flags, which matches the number 3. So the other adjacent cells (5,5, 5,6, 6,6, 7,6) should be safe. Let's check (7,6): it's . (unexplored). So (7,6) can be safely revealed. That's another possible move.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, position (5,5) is 1. The adjacent cells include (4,4) 2, (4,5) 2, (4,6) 1, (5,4) F, (5,6) 1, (6,4) 3, (6,5) 3, (6,6) 2. The 1 at (5,5) has one adjacent flag at (5,4). So the other cells around it must be safe. For example, (5,6) is 1, which is already revealed. But maybe there's an unexplored cell nearby. Let's check (4,6) is 1. The adjacent cells to (5,5) are all revealed except maybe (6,6) is 2, which is already revealed. So perhaps not.\n\nLooking at row 7, position (7,6) is . (unexplored). Since (6,5) is 3 with three flags, (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5) and (6,6) (which is 2). But (7,6) is unexplored. Since (6,5) has all three bombs accounted for, (7,6) should be safe. So revealing (7,6) is a possible move.\n\nAnother possible area is row 4, position (4,3) is 2. Let's check adjacent cells. The cells around (4,3) are (3,2) ., (3,3) ., (3,4) ., (4,2) 1, (4,4) 2, (5,2) _, (5,3) 1, (5,4) F. The 2 at (4,3) has one adjacent flag at (5,4). So there must be another bomb adjacent. The possible unexplored cells are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (5,2) is already revealed as empty. So the remaining bomb must be among (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). But how to determine which one?\n\nAlternatively, looking at (4,4) which is 2. The adjacent cells include (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3) 2, (4,5) 2, (5,3) 1, (5,4) F, (5,5) 1. The 2 at (4,4) has one adjacent flag (5,4). So there must be another bomb. The possible cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) is 2. But (4,5) is 2, which may have its own adjacent bombs. This might be a more complex area.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, position (6,6) is 2. The adjacent cells include (5,5) 1, (5,6) 1, (5,7) ., (6,5) 3, (6,7) ., (7,5) F, (7,6) ., (7,7) .). The 2 at (6,6) has one adjacent flag (7,5). So there must be another bomb. The possible cells are (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7). But since (6,5) is 3 with three flags, (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5) and (6,6). But (6,6) is 2, which needs one more bomb. So maybe (7,6) is a bomb. But how to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward move. Let's go back to the earlier possibilities.\n\nThe 1 at (9,3) has a flag at (8,4), so (9,4) is safe. Let's check (9,4). If we reveal (9,4), that's a possible safe move. Similarly, (7,6) is another possible safe move.\n\nAnother area to check is row 8, position (8,5) is . (unexplored). Let's see if there's a way to deduce that. The cell (8,3) is 2 with two flags adjacent (7,4 and 8,4). So (8,5) is adjacent to (7,4) (F), (7,5) (F), (8,4) (F), (9,4) (.), (9,5) (.), etc. But maybe that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, position (5,6) is 1. The adjacent cells include (4,5) 2, (4,6) 1, (4,7) ., (5,5) 1, (5,7) ., (6,5) 3, (6,6) 2, (6,7) .). The 1 at (5,6) has adjacent cells. Let's see if there's a flag nearby. The only flag in the vicinity is (5,4) which is not adjacent. So the 1 at (5,6) must have one bomb in its adjacent cells. The cells (4,5) is 2, (4,6) is 1, (4,7) is ., (5,7) is ., (6,5) is 3, (6,6) is 2, (6,7) is .). So the unexplored cells are (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). But how to determine which one is the bomb?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more certain move. Let's go back to the 1 at (9,3). Since it's a 1 with a flag at (8,4), the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (9,4) is adjacent to (9,3) and is unexplored. Revealing (9,4) would be safe. Let's check if that's a valid move.\n\nAnother possible move is in row 6, position (6,7) is . (unexplored). The cell (6,6) is 2, which has one adjacent flag (7,5). So there's one more bomb needed. The adjacent cells to (6,6) are (5,5) 1, (5,6) 1, (5,7) ., (6,5) 3, (6,7) ., (7,5) F, (7,6) ., (7,7) .). So the possible bombs are in (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7). But without more info, it's hard to tell. So maybe that's not the best move.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 7, position (7,6) is . (unexplored). The cell (6,5) is 3 with three flags (5,4, 7,4, 7,5). So (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5) and (6,6). Since (6,5) is satisfied, (7,6) should be safe. So revealing (7,6) is a safe move.\n\nSo between (9,4) and (7,6), which is the better move? Let's check if there are any other possibilities.\n\nLooking at row 5, position (5,7) is . (unexplored). The cell (5,6) is 1. The adjacent cells to (5,6) include (4,5) 2, (4,6) 1, (4,7) ., (5,5) 1, (5,7) ., (6,5) 3, (6,6) 2, (6,7) .). The 1 at (5,6) must have exactly one bomb. The existing numbers and flags: (4,5) is 2, which may have its own bombs. (6,5) is 3 with three flags. So the bomb for (5,6) must be in (4,7), (5,7), or (6,7). But without more info, we can't determine which. So maybe that's not a safe move yet.\n\nAnother area to check is row 4, position (4,7) is . (unexplored). The cell (4,6) is 1. The adjacent cells to (4,6) include (3,5) ., (3,6) ., (3,7) ., (4,5) 2, (4,7) ., (5,5) 1, (5,6) 1, (5,7) .). The 1 at (4,6) must have one bomb. The adjacent unexplored cells are (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). But again, not enough info.\n\nSo back to the earlier options. Revealing (9,4) or (7,6) seems safe.\n\nLet me check (9,4) again. The cell (9,3) is 1 with a flag at (8,4). So (9,4) is adjacent to (9,3) and (8,4) (F). Since (9,3) is 1 and already has the flag at (8,4), (9,4) must be safe. So revealing (9,4) is a safe move.\n\nAlternatively, (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5) which is 3 with three flags, so (7,6) should be safe. Let's confirm that. The cell (6,5) is 3, and the three adjacent flags are (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). So all three bombs are accounted for. Therefore, (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5) but since all bombs are already flagged, (7,6) is safe. So revealing (7,6) is also safe.\n\nWhich of these is more likely to lead to progress? Let's see. Revealing (9,4) might open up more of the bottom right area. Revealing (7,6) could open up the right side. Both are safe. But perhaps (9,4) is a better move because it's adjacent to (9,3) which is 1, and revealing it might give a number that helps in further deductions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another spot. Let's check row 8, position (8,5) is . (unexplored). The cell (8,3) is 2 with two flags (7,4 and 8,4). So (8,5) is adjacent to (7,4) (F), (7,5) (F), (8,4) (F), (9,4) (.), (9,5) (.), etc. But since (8,3) is satisfied, (8,5) is not adjacent to it. So maybe (8,5) is unrelated. But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother possible move is in row 5, position (5,7) is . (unexplored). But as discussed earlier, it's adjacent to (5,6) which is 1, but we can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, position (4,7) is . (unexplored). The cell (4,6) is 1. The adjacent cells to (4,6) include (4,7). If (4,7) is a bomb, then (4,6)'s 1 is satisfied. But there's no flag there yet. But since we have flags remaining, maybe we can deduce something. However, without more info, it's risky to place a flag here.\n\nSo between (9,4) and (7,6), which is better? Let's check the board again. (9,4) is in row 9, column 4. The cell (9,4) is adjacent to (8,3) (2), (8,4) (F), (8,5) (.), (9,3) (1), (9,5) (.). If we reveal (9,4) and it's a number, that could help. Similarly, (7,6) is in row 7, column 6. Revealing that might give a number that helps with the right side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more certain flag placement. Let's look for any numbers that require flags.\n\nLooking at row 6, position (6,4) is 3. The adjacent flags are (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). So that's three flags, which matches the number. So no more flags needed there.\n\nLooking at row 7, position (7,3) is 2. Adjacent flags are (7,4) and (8,4), which is two, so that's satisfied.\n\nLooking at row 8, position (8,3) is 2. Adjacent flags are (7,4) and (8,4), which is two, so satisfied.\n\nLooking at row 5, position (5,3) is 1. Adjacent flag is (5,4). Satisfied.\n\nLooking at row 6, position (6,6) is 2. Adjacent flags are (7,5). So one flag, needs one more. The adjacent unexplored cells are (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7). But without more info, can't place a flag here yet.\n\nLooking at row 4, position (4,3) is 2. Adjacent flag is (5,4). Needs one more bomb. The possible cells are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). But how to determine which?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a number that requires a flag. For example, row 6, position (6,3) is 2. Let's check adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (5,2) _, (5,3) 1, (5,4) F, (6,2) _, (6,4) 3, (7,2) _, (7,3) 2, (7,4) F. The 2 at (6,3) has one adjacent flag (5,4). So needs one more bomb. The possible cells are (5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3). But (5,3) is 1, which already has a flag at (5,4). So (5,3) can't have another bomb. (5,2) is _, which is empty. (6,2) is _, empty. (7,2) is _, empty. (7,3) is 2. So the remaining bomb must be in (7,3) or (5,2), but (7,3) is 2 which already has two flags. Wait, (6,3) is 2 with one flag (5,4). So the other bomb must be in one of the adjacent cells. But which one?\n\nWait, (6,3) is 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n- (5,2): empty\n- (5,3): 1 (already has a flag at (5,4))\n- (5,4): flag\n- (6,2): empty\n- (6,4): 3 (has three flags)\n- (7,2): empty\n- (7,3): 2 (has two flags)\n- (7,4): flag\n\nSo the only possible cells for the remaining bomb are (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), but those are all empty. That's a problem. Wait, this suggests a conflict. Because (6,3) is 2, but there's only one flag adjacent (5,4). So there should be one more bomb. But all other adjacent cells are empty. That's impossible. Wait, this must mean there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, let me recheck. The cell (6,3) is 2. Adjacent cells:\n\nLooking at row 6, column 3: the cell is 2.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (5,2): row 5, column 2 is _, which is empty.\n- (5,3): row 5, column 3 is 1.\n- (5,4): F.\n- (6,2): row 6, column 2 is _.\n- (6,4): 3.\n- (7,2): row 7, column 2 is _.\n- (7,3): 2.\n- (7,4): F.\n\nSo the 2 at (6,3) has one flag (5,4). So there must be one more bomb in the adjacent cells. But all other adjacent cells are empty (marked as _) except (5,3) which is 1. But (5,3) is 1 and already has a flag at (5,4). So (5,3) can't have another bomb. Therefore, the remaining bomb must be in one of the empty cells, but they are all revealed as empty. That's a contradiction. This suggests that there's a mistake in the current board state, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have made an error in my analysis.\n\nWait, no. The cell (6,3) is 2. The adjacent cells include (5,2) which is empty, (5,3) which is 1, (5,4) which is F, (6,2) empty, (6,4) 3, (7,2) empty, (7,3) 2, (7,4) F. So the 2 at (6,3) requires two bombs. One is at (5,4), so the other must be in one of the other cells. But all other cells are empty. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a bomb in one of the cells that are currently marked as empty, which is impossible. This suggests that there's a mistake in the flag placement. But according to the board state provided, the flags are correctly placed. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the cell (6,3) is 2, and the adjacent cells have two bombs. But according to the current board, the only flag is at (5,4). So where is the other bomb? This is a problem. This suggests that there's an error in the current board state, which is not possible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a bomb in one of the cells marked as empty. But according to the rules, the numbers must be accurate. So this indicates that there's a bomb in one of the cells adjacent to (6,3) that's currently marked as empty. But that's impossible because those cells are already revealed as empty. Therefore, this suggests that there's a conflict in the current board state. But the user provided the board state, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting it.\n\nWait, let me recheck the board state for row 6:\n\nRow 6: . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 . . .\n\nSo row 6, column 0 is ., column 1 is 1, column 2 is _, column 3 is 2, column 4 is 3, column 5 is 3, column 6 is 2, then . onwards. So (6,3) is 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n- (5,2): row 5, column 2 is _, which is empty.\n- (5,3): row 5, column 3 is 1.\n- (5,4): F.\n- (6,2): row 6, column 2 is _.\n- (6,4): 3.\n- (7,2): row 7, column 2 is _.\n- (7,3): 2.\n- (7,4): F.\n\nSo the 2 at (6,3) has one flag (5,4). Therefore, there must be another bomb in the adjacent cells. But all other adjacent cells are empty. This is a contradiction. This suggests that there's a bomb in one of the empty cells, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is that there's a flag missing. But according to the board, the flags are at (5,4), (7,4), (7,5), (8,4). So perhaps there's a missing flag that should be placed here. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the cell (6,3) is 2, and there's a bomb at (5,3). But (5,3) is 1, which already has a flag at (5,4). That would make (5,3) have two bombs adjacent, which is impossible. Therefore, this is a contradiction. This suggests that the current board state is invalid, but since the user provided it, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (6,3) is 2, and there's a bomb at (7,3). But (7,3) is 2, which would require two bombs adjacent to it. (7,3) has flags at (7,4) and (8,4), which satisfies its 2. So (7,3) is okay. But (6,3) still needs another bomb. This is a problem.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the board state, but since the user provided it, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that the board is correct and look for other moves.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps it's better to focus on the earlier safe moves. For example, (9,4) is safe to reveal because of the 1 at (9,3) with a flag at (8,4). Similarly, (7,6) is safe to reveal because of the 3 at (6,5) with three flags.\n\nBetween these two, I think (9,4) is a better move because it's in an area with fewer revealed cells, which might open up more information. Revealing (9,4) could give a number that helps in deducing more moves in the lower right corner.\n\nAlternatively, (7,6) is also safe. Let's check if there's any other safe moves.\n\nAnother possible move is in row 4, position (4,0) is . (unexplored). But there's no adjacent numbers to suggest it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, position (5,0) is . (unexplored). But no adjacent numbers.\n\nSo the safest moves are (9,4) and (7,6). Let's choose one.\n\nThe cell (9,4) is at (9,4). Let's check if that's within the board. Yes, since the board is 10x10, coordinates go up to 9.\n\nSo the move would be to reveal (9,4). The explanation is that the 1 at (9,3) has a flag at (8,4), so (9,4) must be safe.\n\nAlternatively, the cell (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5) which has three flags, so it's safe.\n\nEither move is valid. Let's pick (7,6) because it's in a more central area and might open up more of the board.\n\nWait, but (7,6) is in row 7, column 6. Let's check the board state for row 7: . 1 _ 2 F F . . . . So (7,6) is . (unexplored). Revealing it would be safe.\n\nSo the explanation for revealing (7,6) is that the cell (6,5) is 3 with three adjacent flags, so all other adjacent cells are safe, including (7,6).\n\nAlternatively, the explanation for (9,4) is that the 1 at (9,3) has a flag at (8,4), so (9,4) is safe.\n\nBoth are valid. Let's choose one. I'll go with (9,4) because it's a more straightforward deduction.\n\nSo the move is to reveal (9,4).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (9,3) is a 1 with an adjacent flag at (8,4). This means the remaining adjacent cells, including (9,4), must be safe to reveal. \n\nMOVE: 9,4,false", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . 1 1 2 2 1 1 . . .\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . . .\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 . . .\n7 . 1 _ 2 F F . . . .\n8 . 1 _ 2 F . . . . .\n9 . 1 _ 1 . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

The goal is to figure out the next safe move, either placing a flag or revealing a square. Let's start by analyzing the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, I'll check the revealed numbers and existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. The game info says there are 6 flags remaining, and the total bombs are 10. So, 10 bombs in total, and 6 flags already placed. Wait, the flags remaining are 6, which means that 10 - 6 = 4 flags have been placed already? Wait, no. Wait, the \"Flags remaining\" is 6. So that means the user has placed 10 - 6 = 4 flags? Because the total bombs are 10. So, 4 flags have been placed, and 6 left to place. Hmm, maybe I need to check the board for existing flags.\n\nLooking at the board, let's scan for F's. In row 5, column 4 is F. Row 7, columns 4 and 5 are F. Row 8, column 4 is F. Wait, let me check each row:\n\nRow 5: (5,4) is F.\nRow 7: (7,4) and (7,5) are F.\nRow 8: (8,4) is F.\nRow 9: None.\n\nSo that's 1 (row5) + 2 (row7) + 1 (row8) = 4 flags placed. So 4 flags used, 6 remaining. That matches the game info. So total bombs are 10, so 6 more flags to place.\n\nNow, let's look at the revealed numbers and see if there are any obvious places to flag or reveal.\n\nStarting from the bottom rows where there's more revealed information. Let's look at row 7: (7,3) is 2, (7,4) and (7,5) are F. The cell (7,3) is a 2. The adjacent cells would include (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). But (7,4) is a flag, so that's one bomb. The 2 in (7,3) requires exactly two bombs adjacent. Since there's already one flag (7,4), there must be one more bomb in the remaining adjacent cells. Let's check which of those are unexplored. The cells around (7,3):\n\nLooking at (6,2): row6, column2. The cell at (6,2) is '_', which is empty. So that's already revealed. (6,3) is 2. (6,4) is 3. (7,2) is '_'. (7,4) is F. (8,2) is '_', (8,3) is 2, (8,4) is F. So all the adjacent cells except maybe (6,4) and (6,3) are already revealed. Wait, (6,4) is 3, which is a number. So the only possible place for the second bomb adjacent to (7,3) would be... Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, (7,3) is 2. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(6,2): empty\n(6,3): 2\n(6,4): 3\n(7,2): empty\n(7,4): F (counts as 1)\n(8,2): empty\n(8,3): 2\n(8,4): F (counts as 1)\n\nWait, but (7,3) is 2. The two flags at (7,4) and (8,4) are adjacent to (7,3)? Wait, (7,4) is adjacent to (7,3) (same row, next column). (8,4) is adjacent to (7,3)? Let's check coordinates. (7,3) is row7, column3. Adjacent cells would be row6-8, columns2-4. So (8,4) is row8, column4. That's adjacent (diagonally). So (7,3) has two adjacent flags: (7,4) and (8,4). Wait, but (7,4) is F, and (8,4) is F. So that's two flags. But the number in (7,3) is 2, which would mean exactly two bombs. So that's correct. So no conflict here. So that's okay.\n\nNow, looking at row6: (6,4) is 3. Let's check adjacent cells. The cell (6,4) is 3. Adjacent cells would include (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). Let's see:\n\n(5,3) is 1 (row5, column3)\n(5,4) is F (flag)\n(5,5) is 1\n(6,3) is 2\n(6,5) is 3\n(7,3) is 2\n(7,4) is F\n(7,5) is F\n\nSo the adjacent flags are (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). That's three flags. But the number in (6,4) is 3. So that's exactly three bombs. So that's correct. No conflict here.\n\nLooking at row5: (5,4) is F. The cell (5,3) is 1. Let's check adjacent cells. (5,3) is 1. Adjacent cells would include (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Let's see:\n\n(4,2) is 1\n(4,3) is 1\n(4,4) is 2\n(5,2) is '_'\n(5,4) is F\n(6,2) is '_'\n(6,3) is 2\n(6,4) is 3\n\nSo the only flag adjacent to (5,3) is (5,4). The number is 1, which matches. So that's okay.\n\nNow, looking for possible moves. Let's check the cells that are numbers and see if their adjacent unexplored cells can be determined.\n\nLooking at row5, column5: (5,5) is 1. Let's check adjacent cells. The cell (5,5) is 1. Adjacent cells include (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Let's see:\n\n(4,4) is 2\n(4,5) is 2\n(4,6) is 1\n(5,4) is F\n(5,6) is 1\n(6,4) is 3\n(6,5) is 3\n(6,6) is 2\n\nSo all adjacent cells are either numbers or flags. Wait, but (5,5) is 1. The only adjacent flag is (5,4). So that's one bomb. The number is 1, so there should be exactly one bomb. So all other adjacent cells must be safe. But all adjacent cells are already revealed except maybe none. Wait, (5,5) is 1, and the adjacent cells are all numbers or flags. So that's okay. No unexplored cells here.\n\nLooking at row6, column5: (6,5) is 3. Let's check adjacent cells. (6,5) is 3. Adjacent cells include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). Let's see:\n\n(5,4) is F\n(5,5) is 1\n(5,6) is 1\n(6,4) is 3\n(6,6) is 2\n(7,4) is F\n(7,5) is F\n(7,6) is '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo the adjacent flags are (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). That's three flags. The number is 3, so that's correct. But there's an unexplored cell at (7,6). Wait, (7,6) is '.' (unexplored). But according to the number 3 in (6,5), there are three bombs adjacent. The three flags already account for three bombs, so (7,6) must be safe. Therefore, (7,6) can be safely revealed.\n\nWait, but (6,5) is 3, and the three flags (5,4), (7,4), (7,5) are adjacent. So those three flags account for the three bombs. Therefore, the remaining adjacent cell (7,6) must be safe. So we can reveal (7,6).\n\nThat's a possible move. Let me check if there are other possibilities.\n\nLooking at row8, column5: (8,5) is 3. Let's check adjacent cells. (8,5) is 3. Adjacent cells include (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). Let's see:\n\n(7,4) is F\n(7,5) is F\n(7,6) is '.' (unexplored)\n(8,4) is F\n(8,6) is '.' (unexplored)\n(9,4) is 1\n(9,5) is 1\n(9,6) is 1\n\nSo adjacent flags are (7,4), (7,5), (8,4) \u2014 three flags. The number is 3, so that's exactly three bombs. Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells (7,6) and (8,6) must be safe. So those can be revealed.\n\nBut wait, (8,5) is 3. The three flags (7,4), (7,5), (8,4) are adjacent. So those three are the bombs. Therefore, (7,6) and (8,6) are safe. So those can be revealed.\n\nBut (7,6) is adjacent to (6,5) which we already considered. So if (7,6) is safe, then revealing it would be a good move.\n\nAnother possible move is (7,6). Let's check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row6, column6: (6,6) is 2. Let's check adjacent cells. (6,6) is 2. Adjacent cells include (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). Let's see:\n\n(5,5) is 1\n(5,6) is 1\n(5,7) is '.' (unexplored)\n(6,5) is 3\n(6,7) is '.' (unexplored)\n(7,5) is F\n(7,6) is '.' (unexplored)\n(7,7) is '.' (unexplored)\n\nSo adjacent flags: (7,5). The number is 2, so there must be two bombs. One is already flagged (7,5), so there's one more bomb in the remaining cells. The unexplored cells here are (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7). But this might be more complex. Maybe not the best place to look right now.\n\nBack to the earlier thought: (7,6) can be revealed because (6,5) has three flags adjacent, so (7,6) is safe. Similarly, (8,6) is safe because (8,5) has three flags adjacent. Let's check if those cells are unexplored.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow7, column6 is '.' (unexplored). So yes, (7,6) is unexplored. So revealing (7,6) would be safe.\n\nAnother possible spot: row5, column2 is '_', which is empty. The cell (5,2) is '_', so it's already revealed. Wait, no. Looking at row5: (5,2) is '_', which is empty. So that's already revealed. So nothing to do there.\n\nLooking at row6, column2: (6,2) is '_', so already revealed. Similarly, (7,2) is '_'.\n\nLooking at row8, column2: (8,2) is '_', so already revealed.\n\nLooking at row9, column2: (9,2) is '_', which is empty. So that's revealed.\n\nNow, looking at row4, columns 1-5: (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1, (4,3) is 2, (4,4) is 2, (4,5) is 1. Let's check if any of these numbers have adjacent unexplored cells that can be determined.\n\nTake (4,1) which is 1. Adjacent cells include (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Let's see:\n\n(3,0) is '.' (unexplored)\n(3,1) is '.' (unexplored)\n(3,2) is '.' (unexplored)\n(4,0) is '.' (unexplored)\n(4,2) is 1\n(5,0) is '.' (unexplored)\n(5,1) is 1\n(5,2) is '_'\n\nSo (4,1) is 1. The adjacent cells include (5,1) which is 1, (4,2) which is 1, and (5,2) which is '_'. The unexplored cells here are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (5,0). But since (4,1) is 1, there must be exactly one bomb in those adjacent cells. However, there are no flags here, so the bomb could be in any of the unexplored cells. But without more info, it's hard to determine. So maybe not the best spot to look.\n\nAnother area: row5, column3 is 1. Adjacent cells include (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). All of these are either numbers or flags except (5,2) is '_', which is empty. So no unexplored cells here.\n\nLooking at row6, column3 is 2. Adjacent cells include (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,4) is F, (7,4) is F. So the 2 in (6,3) requires two bombs. The two flags (5,4) and (7,4) are adjacent. So that's two bombs. So all other adjacent cells must be safe. Let's check the adjacent cells:\n\n(5,2) is '_' (empty)\n(5,3) is 1\n(5,4) is F\n(6,2) is '_'\n(6,4) is 3\n(7,2) is '_'\n(7,3) is 2\n(7,4) is F\n\nSo all adjacent cells are either numbers or flags, except none. So that's okay.\n\nAnother possible spot: row7, column6 is '.' (unexplored). As discussed earlier, this cell is adjacent to (6,5) which is 3 with three flags, so (7,6) must be safe. So revealing (7,6) is a safe move.\n\nAlternatively, (8,6) is '.' and adjacent to (8,5) which is 3 with three flags, so (8,6) is safe. But (8,6) is in row8, column6. Let's check the board state for row8:\n\nRow8: . 1 _ 2 F 3 . . . .\n\nSo (8,6) is '.' (unexplored). So yes, that's a candidate.\n\nBut which one to choose first? Let's check if there are other cells that can be safely revealed.\n\nAnother area: row9, column5 is 1. Let's check adjacent cells. (9,5) is 1. Adjacent cells include (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), and others. Let's see:\n\n(8,4) is F\n(8,5) is 3\n(8,6) is '.' (unexplored)\n(9,4) is 1\n(9,6) is 1\n\nSo the adjacent cells: (8,4) is F (counts as bomb), (8,5) is 3 (number), (8,6) is unexplored, (9,4) is 1, (9,6) is 1. The number in (9,5) is 1. So there must be exactly one bomb adjacent. The flag at (8,4) is adjacent to (9,5)? Let's check coordinates. (9,5) is row9, column5. Adjacent cells would be row8-10 (but board is 10x10, so up to row9), columns4-6. So (8,4) is row8, column4: yes, diagonally adjacent. So (8,4) is a flag, which counts as a bomb. So the 1 in (9,5) is satisfied by the flag at (8,4). Therefore, all other adjacent cells must be safe. So (8,6) is adjacent to (9,5) and must be safe. So (8,6) can be revealed.\n\nSo both (7,6) and (8,6) are safe to reveal. Which one to choose?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be flagged. Let's check.\n\nLooking at row6, column4: (6,4) is 3. Adjacent cells include (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The flags here are (5,4) is F, (7,4) is F, (7,5) is F. So three flags. The number is 3, so that's correct. No conflicts.\n\nLooking at row7, column3: 2 with two flags adjacent. Correct.\n\nLooking for any numbers that have more flags than their number. For example, a 1 with two flags. But I don't see any such cases.\n\nNow, looking for numbers that have a number higher than the adjacent flags, indicating possible bombs in unexplored cells.\n\nFor example, row8, column3 is 2. Let's check adjacent cells. (8,3) is 2. Adjacent cells include (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). Let's see:\n\n(7,2) is '_'\n(7,3) is 2\n(7,4) is F\n(8,2) is '_'\n(8,4) is F\n(9,2) is '_'\n(9,3) is '_'\n(9,4) is 1\n\nSo adjacent flags are (7,4) and (8,4). That's two flags. The number is 2, so that's correct. So no unexplored cells here. All adjacent cells are either revealed or flags.\n\nAnother cell: row6, column4 is 3. As discussed earlier, three flags adjacent. Correct.\n\nLooking at row5, column4 is F. The cell (5,4) is flagged. Let's check if that's correct. The cell (5,4) is adjacent to (4,3) which is 2. Let's see: (4,3) is 2. Adjacent cells include (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). The flags here are (5,4). So (4,3) is 2. Are there other flags? Let's see. (4,4) is 2. So (4,3) is 2. The adjacent cells include (5,4) which is F. So one flag. So there must be one more bomb in the adjacent cells. The unexplored cells around (4,3) are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2) is 1, (4,4) is 2, (5,2) is '_', (5,3) is 1. So the unexplored cells are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). So one of those must be a bomb. But without more info, can't determine which. So maybe not helpful right now.\n\nBack to the possible safe reveals. (7,6) and (8,6) are both safe. Let's check which one to choose.\n\nLooking at (7,6): revealing this could open up more information. Let's see. If (7,6) is revealed and is safe, it might show a number that helps with adjacent cells. Similarly for (8,6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be flagged. Let's check row5, column4 is F. But that's already flagged. Are there any numbers that indicate exactly the number of adjacent unexplored cells, which would allow us to flag them?\n\nFor example, row5, column5 is 1. Adjacent cells include (5,4) which is F, and other cells. But we already checked that.\n\nLooking at row7, column6: if we reveal it and it's a number, that could help. Let's proceed.\n\nSo the safest move seems to be to reveal (7,6) because it's adjacent to (6,5) which has three flags, so (7,6) must be safe.\n\nAlternatively, (8,6) is also safe. Let's check if there's any other cell that's a better candidate.\n\nLooking at row9, column6: (9,6) is 1. Adjacent cells include (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7), etc. (8,6) is '.' (unexplored). The 1 in (9,6) has adjacent cells: (8,5) is 3, (8,6) is '.', (9,5) is 1, (9,7) is '.' (unexplored). The number is 1. Are there any flags adjacent? (8,5) is 3, which has flags, but (9,6) is adjacent to (8,5) but not to the flags in (8,5). Wait, (9,6) is adjacent to (8,5) (row8, column5) which is 3. The adjacent cells to (9,6) are (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7), (10,5), etc. But row10 doesn't exist. So (8,5) is 3, which has three flags adjacent. But (9,6) is adjacent to (8,5), but the flags are in (7,4), (7,5), (8,4). So (9,6) is not adjacent to any flags. Therefore, the 1 in (9,6) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. The unexplored cells are (8,6), (8,7), (9,7). So one of those must be a bomb. But without more info, can't determine which. So not helpful.\n\nBack to the earlier conclusion: (7,6) is safe to reveal. Let's make that move.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (6,5) is a 3 with three adjacent flags (5,4), (7,4), and (7,5). This means all other adjacent cells, including (7,6), must be safe. Revealing (7,6) will provide more information without risking a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 7,6,false", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . 1 1 2 2 1 1 . . .\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . . .\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 . . .\n7 . 1 _ 2 F F . . . .\n8 . 1 _ 2 F 3 . . . .\n9 . 1 _ 1 1 1 . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 7, "y": 7, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next move, either placing a flag or revealing a tile, without hitting a bomb. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 6 flags remaining. Let's start by analyzing the current state.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the board for numbers that are adjacent to unexplored tiles (marked as .) and existing flags (F). Let's check each revealed number to see if their adjacent flags satisfy their count or if there's a conflict.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 5 (2,5) is a '.', but the surrounding numbers might give clues. Wait, no, the board shows row 2, column 5 as '.' but the number at (2,4) is 2. Let me check around that. The 2 at (2,4) has adjacent cells. Let's see: the cells around (2,4) are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Looking at the current state, (2,5) is a '.' but (3,5) is a 1. Wait, maybe I should check other areas first.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 4 (4,4) is a 2. The adjacent cells here might have flags. Let's check around (4,4). The cells around it would be (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3) is a ., (3,4) is a ., (3,5) is a 1. (5,4) is an F (flagged). So the 2 at (4,4) has one adjacent flag (from (5,4)). Since the number is 2, there must be exactly two bombs. Since there's already one flag, there should be one more bomb in the adjacent cells. The remaining unexplored cells around (4,4) are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5). Wait, (4,3) is a 2, (4,5) is a 1, (5,3) is 1, (5,5) is 1. So the unexplored cells here are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). But (3,5) is a 1, which is already revealed. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, (4,4) is 2. Adjacent cells include (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Among these, (5,4) is F. So the count is 1 flag. The number is 2, so there's one more bomb needed. The remaining adjacent cells that are unexplored: (3,3) is ., (3,4) is ., (3,5) is 1 (already revealed), (4,3) is 2 (revealed), (4,5) is 1 (revealed), (5,3) is 1 (revealed), (5,5) is 1 (revealed). So the only unexplored cells adjacent to (4,4) are (3,3) and (3,4). Therefore, one of these two must be a bomb. But how to determine which one?\n\nLooking at other numbers that might influence this. Let's check (3,5) which is a 1. The adjacent cells to (3,5) are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4) is 2, (2,5) is ., (2,6) is 1, (3,4) is ., (3,6) is 1, (4,4) is 2, (4,5) is 1, (4,6) is 1. The 1 at (3,5) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The only unexplored cells here are (2,5) and (3,4). If either of those is a bomb, it would affect the count. But (3,5) is a 1, so there must be exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. If (3,4) is a bomb, then (3,5)'s count would be satisfied. But (3,4) is adjacent to (4,4)'s 2, which already needs one more bomb. So if (3,4) is a bomb, then (4,4)'s 2 would be satisfied (since (5,4) is F and (3,4) is a bomb). But also, (3,4) being a bomb would affect (3,3)'s adjacent cells. Wait, (3,3) is a 1. Let's check (3,3). The cell (3,3) is a 1. Its adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,2) is 1, (2,3) is 1, (2,4) is 2, (3,2) is 1, (3,4) is ., (4,2) is 1, (4,3) is 2, (4,4) is 2. The 1 at (3,3) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The unexplored cells here are (3,4). So if (3,4) is a bomb, then (3,3)'s count would be 1, which is correct. But if (3,4) is a bomb, then (3,5)'s count would also be 1 (since (3,4) is adjacent to (3,5)), which is correct. So (3,4) being a bomb would satisfy both (3,3) and (3,5), and (4,4). But then, what about (3,4) itself? If (3,4) is a bomb, then the cells around it must account for that. Let's see: (3,4) is adjacent to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). The numbers here are (2,3) is 1, (2,4) is 2, (3,3) is 1, (3,5) is 1, (4,3) is 2, (4,4) is 2, (4,5) is 1. If (3,4) is a bomb, then the numbers around it must account for that. For example, (2,4) is 2. The adjacent bombs would be (3,4) and (3,5) if (3,5) is a bomb. Wait, but (3,5) is a 1, which already has (3,4) as a bomb. Wait, no. (3,5) is a 1, which would have (3,4) as a bomb. Then (3,5)'s count is 1, which is correct. But (2,4) is a 2. The adjacent bombs would be (3,4) and (3,5) if (3,5) is a bomb. But (3,5) is a 1, which can't have another bomb. Wait, (2,4) is a 2. Let's check the adjacent cells to (2,4): (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). The existing flags or bombs: (5,4) is F, but that's not adjacent to (2,4). Wait, (2,4) is 2. The adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). The only flags here are none. So (2,4) needs two bombs in those cells. If (3,4) is a bomb, then another bomb must be in one of the other cells. Let's see: (1,3) is ., (1,4) is 1, (1,5) is 1, (2,3) is 1, (2,5) is ., (3,3) is 1, (3,4) is ., (3,5) is 1. So the possible bombs for (2,4) are (3,4) and (2,5). Because (3,4) is a bomb, then (2,4) would have one bomb, but it needs two. So there must be another bomb in (2,5) or (1,3) or (1,4) or (1,5), but those cells are in row 1. Let's check row 1. For example, (1,4) is 1. The adjacent cells to (1,4) are (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). The 1 at (1,4) must have exactly one bomb. If (2,4) is a 2, and (3,4) is a bomb, then (1,4)'s adjacent bombs would be (2,4) has a bomb? Wait, no. (1,4) is adjacent to (2,4), which is a number 2, not a bomb. So (1,4)'s bomb must be in one of the other cells. Let's see: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5) are all unexplored (.), (1,3) is ., (1,5) is 1, (2,3) is 1, (2,4) is 2, (2,5) is . So the possible bombs for (1,4) are in (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (2,5). But (1,4) is 1, so only one of these can be a bomb. But this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better area to look at.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4 (5,4) is flagged (F). Let's check the numbers around it. The cell (5,4) is F. The adjacent cells would be (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3) is 2, (4,4) is 2, (4,5) is 1, (5,3) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3, (6,5) is 3. Let's check if the flag at (5,4) is correctly placed. For example, the cell (6,4) is 3. The adjacent cells to (6,4) are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The flag at (5,4) is one bomb. The 3 at (6,4) needs three bombs. The adjacent cells: (5,3) is 1 (so no bomb there), (5,4) is F (counts as 1), (5,5) is 1 (no bomb), (6,3) is 2, (6,5) is 3, (7,3) is ., (7,4) is F, (7,5) is F. Wait, (7,4) and (7,5) are F. So the 3 at (6,4) has F at (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). That's three flags. But the number is 3, so that's correct. So those three flags account for the 3. So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, (7,4) and (7,5) are F. Let's check the numbers around them. For example, (7,4) is F. The cell (7,4) is adjacent to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). The number at (6,4) is 3, which is satisfied by the three flags. The cell (8,4) is F. Let's check (8,4). The cell (8,4) is F. Adjacent cells include (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). The cell (8,5) is 3. The 3 at (8,5) must have three bombs. The adjacent cells are (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). (7,4) and (7,5) are F, (8,4) is F, so that's three flags. So the 3 at (8,5) is satisfied. So those flags are correctly placed.\n\nBut back to the original problem. Let's look for other areas. The cell (5,0) is ., (5,1) is 1. The cell (5,0) is unexplored. Let's check the numbers around it. The cell (5,1) is 1. Adjacent cells include (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1, (5,0) is ., (5,2) is ., (6,0) is ., (6,1) is 1, (6,2) is .. The 1 at (5,1) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. The unexplored cells here are (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2). Let's see if any of these can be determined. For example, if (5,0) is a bomb, then (4,0) which is 1 would have that bomb. But (4,0) is 1, so if (5,0) is a bomb, then (4,0)'s adjacent cells must have exactly one bomb. The adjacent cells to (4,0) are (3, -1) which is invalid, (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0) is ., (3,1) is ., (4,1) is 1, (5,0) is ., (5,1) is 1. So (4,0) is 1, which would need exactly one bomb in those cells. If (5,0) is a bomb, then (4,0)'s count is satisfied. But then (5,1)'s count would also have that bomb. So (5,1) is 1, which would have (5,0) as the only bomb. That seems possible. But how do we know if (5,0) is safe or a bomb?\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,0) is safe. Let's see. If (5,0) is safe, then the bomb for (5,1) must be in (5,2) or (6,0) or (6,2). But without more info, it's hard to tell. Maybe this area is too ambiguous. Let's look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 9 (8,9) is 1. The adjacent cells to (8,9) are (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9). (7,8) is ., (7,9) is ., (8,8) is ., (9,8) is ., (9,9) is .. The 1 at (8,9) must have exactly one bomb in those cells. But since all adjacent cells are unexplored, it's hard to tell. But maybe there's a better spot.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 6 (7,6) is 1. Adjacent cells include (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). (6,5) is 3, (6,6) is 2, (6,7) is 1, (7,5) is F, (7,7) is ., (8,5) is 3, (8,6) is 1, (8,7) is .. The 1 at (7,6) must have exactly one bomb. The adjacent cells with flags: (7,5) is F. So that's one bomb. Therefore, the other cells adjacent to (7,6) must be safe. For example, (7,7) is ., but since the count is already satisfied by the flag at (7,5), (7,7) must be safe. So we can reveal (7,7). That seems like a safe move.\n\nWait, let's confirm. The cell (7,6) is 1. Adjacent cells: (6,5) is 3, (6,6) is 2, (6,7) is 1, (7,5) is F, (7,7) is ., (8,5) is 3, (8,6) is 1, (8,7) is .. The 1 at (7,6) has one adjacent flag (F at 7,5). Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells must have zero bombs. So (7,7) is safe to reveal. That's a good candidate.\n\nSo the move would be to reveal (7,7). Let's check if that's possible. The cell (7,7) is currently unexplored (.), and according to the analysis, it's safe. So the move would be x=7, y=7, flag=false.\n\nAnother possible area: looking at row 6, column 7 (6,7) is 1. Adjacent cells include (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). (5,6) is 1, (5,7) is ., (5,8) is ., (6,6) is 2, (6,8) is 1, (7,6) is 1, (7,7) is ., (7,8) is .. The 1 at (6,7) must have exactly one bomb. The adjacent cells: (5,7) and (5,8) are unexplored. If there's a bomb in (5,7), then (5,6) which is 1 would have that bomb. But (5,6) is 1, so if (5,7) is a bomb, then (5,6)'s count is satisfied. But (6,7) is 1, so only one bomb in adjacent cells. So either (5,7) or (5,8) or (7,7) or (7,8) could be the bomb. But without more info, it's hard to tell. Maybe this area is not the best to focus on.\n\nBack to the previous idea: revealing (7,7) seems safe. Let's check if there are any other obvious moves. For example, looking at row 8, column 7 (8,7) is .. The cell (8,6) is 1. Adjacent cells to (8,6) are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). (7,5) is F, (7,6) is 1, (7,7) is ., (8,5) is 3, (8,7) is ., (9,5) is 1, (9,6) is ., (9,7) is .. The 1 at (8,6) must have exactly one bomb. The adjacent flag at (7,5) is already counted. Wait, (7,5) is F, but is it adjacent to (8,6)? Let's check: (8,6) is at row 8, column 6. Adjacent cells would be (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). So (7,5) is indeed adjacent. So the 1 at (8,6) has one bomb from (7,5). Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells must have zero bombs. So (8,7) and (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) must be safe. But (9,5) is 1, which is already revealed. So (8,7) is safe to reveal. That's another possible move.\n\nBut between (7,7) and (8,7), which is better? Let's see. Revealing (7,7) is adjacent to (7,6) which is 1, and we already determined it's safe. So that's a good move.\n\nAnother possible area: row 5, column 7 (5,7) is .. The cell (5,6) is 1. Adjacent cells to (5,6) are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (4,5) is 1, (4,6) is 1, (4,7) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (5,7) is ., (6,5) is 3, (6,6) is 2, (6,7) is 1. The 1 at (5,6) must have exactly one bomb. The unexplored cell here is (5,7). So (5,7) could be the bomb. But how to confirm? If (5,7) is a bomb, then the adjacent cells like (5,8) (which is .) would be affected. But without more info, it's hard to tell. Maybe this is a possible flag placement, but since we have 6 flags remaining and 10 bombs, but there are already some flags placed. Let's count the existing flags.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFlags (F) are at:\n\n(5,4), (7,4), (7,5), (8,4), (8,5), (9,4) \u2014 wait, let me check each row.\n\nRow 5: (5,4) is F.\n\nRow 7: (7,4) and (7,5) are F.\n\nRow 8: (8,4) is F.\n\nRow 9: (9,4) is F? Wait, looking at row 9:\n\nRow 9: . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .\n\nSo columns 0: ., 1:1, 2:_, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:_, 7:_, 8:1, 9:.. So no F in row 9. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 5: (5,4) is F.\n\nRow 7: (7,4) and (7,5) are F.\n\nRow 8: (8,4) is F.\n\nRow 6: no F.\n\nRow 4: no F.\n\nRow 3: no F.\n\nRow 2: no F.\n\nRow 1: no F.\n\nRow 0: no F.\n\nSo total flags placed: 1 (row5) + 2 (row7) + 1 (row8) = 4 flags. The game info says flags remaining:6. So total flags placed are 10 bombs - 6 remaining = 4 flags placed. That matches. So there are 4 flags already placed, and 6 remaining. So we can place up to 6 more flags.\n\nBut back to the analysis. The cell (5,7) is a possible bomb for (5,6)'s 1. If we can confirm that, we can flag it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another area where a number is already satisfied by existing flags, and the remaining cells can be revealed.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 3 (6,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,2) is ., (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is F, (6,2) is ., (6,4) is 3, (7,2) is ., (7,3) is ., (7,4) is F. The 2 at (6,3) has two adjacent flags: (5,4) and (7,4). So that's two flags, which matches the number 2. Therefore, all other adjacent cells must be safe. So (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3) can be safely revealed. For example, (5,2) is ., which can be revealed. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nThe cell (5,2) is unexplored. Since (6,3) is 2 and has two flags adjacent, the remaining cells around (6,3) must be safe. So (5,2) is safe to reveal. That's another possible move.\n\nSo possible moves are:\n\n1. Reveal (7,7) because (7,6) is 1 with a flag already adjacent.\n\n2. Reveal (5,2) because (6,3) is 2 with two flags adjacent.\n\n3. Reveal (8,7) because (8,6) is 1 with a flag adjacent.\n\nWhich of these is the best move? Let's check each.\n\nFor move 1: (7,7) is ., adjacent to (7,6) which is 1. The 1 at (7,6) has a flag at (7,5), so (7,7) is safe. Revealing this would open up more information.\n\nFor move 2: (5,2) is ., and revealing it could help in the lower part of the board. If (5,2) is safe, it might give numbers that help with other areas.\n\nFor move 3: (8,7) is ., adjacent to (8,6) which is 1. The 1 at (8,6) has a flag at (7,5), so (8,7) is safe.\n\nAll three seem valid. Let's prioritize which one is more likely to give useful information.\n\nRevealing (7,7) is in the middle of the board, which might open up more cells. Alternatively, (5,2) is in the upper part. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, column 0 (5,0) is ., but that's in a more isolated area. Maybe revealing (5,2) is better.\n\nBut let's think again. The cell (6,3) is 2 with two flags adjacent (5,4 and 7,4). Therefore, all other adjacent cells must be safe. So (5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3) are safe. (5,3) is already revealed as 1. (5,2) is ., so revealing it would be safe. Similarly, (6,2) is ., (7,2) is ., (7,3) is .. So revealing (5,2) is a definite safe move.\n\nSo the move would be to reveal (5,2). Let's check if that's correct.\n\nYes, because the 2 at (6,3) has two flags, so all other adjacent cells are safe. Therefore, (5,2) is safe. Revealing it would give a number, which could help in further analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,2) is already revealed. Wait, looking at the board state:\n\nRow 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . 1 _\n\nSo row 5, column 2 is _, which is an empty revealed space. Wait, no. Wait, the board state for row 5 is:\n\nRow 4: 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n\nRow 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . 1 _\n\nSo row 5, column 0 is ., column 1 is 1, column 2 is _, which is empty revealed. So (5,2) is already revealed as empty. Wait, no. The underscore _ represents an empty revealed space. So (5,2) is already revealed and empty. So that cell is already open. Therefore, the adjacent cells to (6,3) that are unexplored are (5,2) is already revealed, so no. Wait, (5,2) is in row 5, column 2. Looking at row 5, column 2 is _, which is empty. So (5,2) is already revealed. Therefore, the unexplored cells adjacent to (6,3) are (5,2) is already revealed, (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is F, (6,2) is ., (6,4) is 3, (7,2) is ., (7,3) is ., (7,4) is F. So the remaining unexplored cells are (6,2), (7,2), (7,3). So those can be safely revealed. For example, (6,2) is ., so revealing it would be safe.\n\nSo the move would be to reveal (6,2). Let's check that.\n\nThe cell (6,2) is ., and since (6,3) is 2 with two flags, all other adjacent cells are safe. So (6,2) is safe to reveal. That's a valid move.\n\nBut looking back at the board state for row 6:\n\nRow 6: . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _\n\nSo row 6, column 2 is _, which is empty. Wait, no. Row 6's columns are:\n\n0: ., 1:1, 2:_, 3:2, 4:3, 5:3, 6:2, 7:1, 8:1, 9:_. So (6,2) is _, which is empty revealed. So it's already open. Therefore, the unexplored cells adjacent to (6,3) are (7,2) and (7,3). So those are . and need to be revealed.\n\nSo (7,2) and (7,3) are unexplored. Let's check (7,2). The cell (7,2) is ., and according to the 2 at (6,3), it's safe. So revealing (7,2) is a valid move.\n\nBut looking at the board state for row 7:\n\nRow 7: . 1 _ 2 F F 1 _ _ _\n\nSo row 7, column 2 is _, which is empty. Wait, no. Row 7's columns:\n\n0: ., 1:1, 2:_, 3:2, 4:F, 5:F, 6:1, 7:_, 8:_, 9:_. So (7,2) is _, which is empty. So it's already revealed. Therefore, the unexplored cells adjacent to (6,3) are (7,3). So (7,3) is ., which is unexplored. So revealing (7,3) is safe.\n\nBut according to the board state, row 7, column 3 is 2. Wait, no. Row 7, column 3 is 2. So (7,3) is 2, which is already revealed. Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nRow 7: . 1 _ 2 F F 1 _ _ _\n\nSo columns 0: ., 1:1, 2:_, 3:2, 4:F, 5:F, 6:1, 7:_, 8:_, 9:_. So (7,3) is 2, which is revealed. So the only unexplored cell adjacent to (6,3) is (7,3) is already revealed. Wait, this is confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nThe adjacent cells to (6,3) are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,2) is _, (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is F, (6,2) is _, (6,4) is 3, (7,2) is _, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is F. So all adjacent cells are either revealed or flagged. Therefore, there are no unexplored cells adjacent to (6,3). So that area is already fully resolved. So maybe that's not the right path.\n\nBack to the earlier idea: revealing (7,7) is safe. Let's confirm again. The cell (7,6) is 1, and it has a flag at (7,5). Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells must be safe. (7,7) is adjacent to (7,6), so it's safe. Revealing (7,7) would give a number, which could help.\n\nAnother possible move: cell (9,9) is ., but it's in the bottom-right corner. The cell (9,9) is adjacent to (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). (8,9) is 1, (8,8) is ., (9,8) is .. The 1 at (8,9) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. The unexplored cells are (8,8), (9,8), (9,9). So one of these must be a bomb. But without more info, it's hard to tell. This area might be too ambiguous.\n\nAnother area: row 8, column 7 (8,7) is .. The cell (8,6) is 1. Adjacent cells to (8,6) include (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). (7,5) is F, (7,6) is 1, (7,7) is ., (8,5) is 3, (8,7) is ., (9,5) is 1, (9,6) is ., (9,7) is .. The 1 at (8,6) has one flag at (7,5), so the remaining cells must be safe. Therefore, (8,7) is safe to reveal. So that's another valid move.\n\nSo between (7,7) and (8,7), which is better? Both are safe. Revealing (7,7) might open up more cells in the middle, while (8,7) is near the bottom. Let's choose (7,7) first.\n\nSo the move would be to reveal (7,7). Let's confirm once more. The cell (7,6) is 1, adjacent to (7,5) which is F. Therefore, no other bombs can be adjacent to (7,6). (7,7) is adjacent to (7,6), so it's safe. Therefore, the move is x=7, y=7, flag=false.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (7,6) is a 1 with an adjacent flag at (7,5). This means the remaining adjacent cells, including (7,7), must be safe. Revealing (7,7) will provide more information without risking a bomb.\n\nMOVE: 7,7,false", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 . . . 1 _ _ _\n4 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . 1 _\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _\n7 . 1 _ 2 F F 1 _ _ _\n8 . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\n9 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 7, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next move, either placing a flag or revealing a tile. Let's start by analyzing the current state of the board and the game info.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with 10 bombs and 6 flags remaining. The board has some revealed numbers, flags, and unexplored spaces (marked as .). Let's go through each area step by step.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 9 (4,9) is an empty revealed space (_), but the space to the right (4,10) would be out of bounds. Wait, the board is 10x10, so columns go from 0 to 9. So (4,9) is the last column in row 4. That's an empty space. Hmm, maybe not important right now.\n\nLooking at row 5: positions (5,0) is a ., (5,1) is 1, (5,2) is _, (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is F (flagged), (5,5) is 1, etc. So in row 5, column 4 is flagged. Let's check the numbers around that flag. The cell at (5,3) is 1. Since there's a flag at (5,4), that 1 in (5,3) should account for exactly one bomb. So the adjacent cells to (5,3) must have exactly one bomb. The adjacent cells would include (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). But (5,4) is flagged, so the other cells around (5,3) should be safe. Let's check if any of those are unexplored. For example, (5,2) is _, which is revealed and empty. (6,2) is _, (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3. So maybe that's okay. The 1 at (5,3) is satisfied by the flag at (5,4).\n\nNow, looking at row 6: (6,0) is ., (6,1) is 1, (6,2) is _, (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3, etc. The cell at (6,3) is 2. Let's check adjacent cells. The adjacent cells would be (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). The flagged cell at (5,4) is adjacent to (6,3). So that's one bomb. The number is 2, so there should be another bomb in the remaining adjacent cells. Let's see which of those are unexplored. (5,2) is _, which is revealed empty. (5,3) is 1. (6,2) is _, which is empty. (6,4) is 3. (7,2) is _, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is F. Wait, (7,4) is flagged. So that's another bomb. So the 2 at (6,3) has two adjacent flags: (5,4) and (7,4). But wait, (7,4) is a flag. So that would account for two bombs, which matches the number 2. So that's okay. So maybe that's all accounted for.\n\nLooking at row 7: (7,0) is ., (7,1) is 1, (7,2) is _, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is F, (7,5) is F, etc. The cell at (7,3) is 2. Let's check adjacent cells. The adjacent cells would be (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). The flags at (7,4) and (7,5) are in adjacent cells? Wait, (7,4) is adjacent to (7,3), yes. So (7,4) is a flag, which counts as one bomb. The number is 2, so there should be another bomb. The adjacent cells to (7,3) that are unexplored: (7,2) is _, (8,2) is _, (8,3) is 2, (8,4) is F. Wait, (8,4) is a flag. So that's another bomb. So (7,3) has two adjacent flags: (7,4) and (8,4). But (8,4) is adjacent to (7,3)? Let me check coordinates. (7,3) is row 7, column 3. (8,4) is row 8, column 4. So diagonally adjacent. Yes, that's part of the 8 surrounding cells. So (7,3) has two flags adjacent, which matches the number 2. So that's okay.\n\nNow, looking at row 8: (8,0) is ., (8,1) is 1, (8,2) is _, (8,3) is 2, (8,4) is F, (8,5) is 3, etc. The cell at (8,3) is 2. Adjacent cells include (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). The flags here are (7,4) and (8,4). So two flags adjacent. The number is 2, so that's correct. So no issues here.\n\nLooking at row 9: (9,0) is ., (9,1) is 1, (9,2) is _, (9,3) is 1, (9,4) is 1, (9,5) is 1, (9,6) is _, (9,7) is _, (9,8) is 1, (9,9) is . So there's a 1 at (9,3). Let's check adjacent cells. The adjacent cells would be (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (9,4) is 1, (9,2) is _, etc. The cell (8,3) is 2, which is already accounted for. The 1 at (9,3) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Let's see which cells are unexplored. (8,2) is _, (9,2) is _, (9,4) is 1. So the unexplored cells around (9,3) are (8,2) and (9,2). But (8,2) is _, which is revealed as empty. Wait, no: (8,2) is _, which is an empty revealed space. So (9,3) is 1, but all adjacent cells except (9,2) are either revealed or have numbers. Wait, (9,2) is _, which is empty. Wait, no: (9,2) is _, which is an empty revealed space. Wait, no: looking back at the board state for row 9, (9,2) is _, which is empty. So the 1 at (9,3) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. But all adjacent cells except maybe (8,4) which is flagged. Wait, (8,4) is a flag. So (9,3) is adjacent to (8,4) (row 8, column 4). Let's check: (9,3) is row 9, column 3. (8,4) is row 8, column 4. That's diagonally adjacent. So the 1 at (9,3) has a bomb at (8,4). So that's accounted for. So the 1 is satisfied. So (9,3) is okay.\n\nNow, looking for areas where numbers are not yet satisfied. Let's check row 5, column 7 (5,7) is a . (unexplored). Wait, row 5: (5,7) is .? Let me check the board again. The row 5 is:\n\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . 1 _\n\nWait, the original board state for row 5 is:\n\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . 1 _\n\nWait, perhaps the columns are 0-9. Let me parse row 5 correctly. The user's board state for row 5 is:\n\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . 1 _\n\nWait, that's 10 columns (0-9). So:\n\n5,0: . (unexplored)\n\n5,1: 1\n\n5,2: _ (empty)\n\n5,3: 1\n\n5,4: F (flag)\n\n5,5: 1\n\n5,6: 1\n\n5,7: . (unexplored)\n\n5,8: 1\n\n5,9: _ (empty)\n\nSo (5,7) is unexplored. Let's check the numbers around it. The cell (5,7) is adjacent to (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). Let's see what those are.\n\n(4,6) is 1 (row 4, column 6: 1)\n\n(4,7) is 1\n\n(4,8) is 1\n\n(5,6) is 1\n\n(5,8) is 1\n\n(6,6) is 2 (row 6, column 6: 2)\n\n(6,7) is 1\n\n(6,8) is 1\n\nSo the cell (5,7) is surrounded by several 1s and a 2. But since (5,7) is unexplored, maybe there's a bomb there. But let's check if any of the adjacent numbers require a bomb here.\n\nLooking at (4,6) which is 1. The adjacent cells to (4,6) include (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). The 1 at (4,6) must have exactly one bomb in those cells. Let's see if there are any flags here. The only flag nearby is (5,4), which is not adjacent. Are there any other flags? (5,4) is in row 5, column 4. So (4,6) is adjacent to (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is 1, (5,7) is unexplored. So the 1 at (4,6) must have exactly one bomb in those cells. But there are no flags here. So the bomb could be in (5,7). But how do we know?\n\nAlternatively, maybe other cells around (4,6) have bombs. Let's check. For example, (3,5) is . (unexplored in row 3, column 5). (3,6) is . (row 3, column 6). (3,7) is 1 (row 3, column 7). (4,5) is 2 (row 4, column 5). (4,7) is 1. (5,5) is 1. (5,6) is 1. (5,7) is . So the 1 at (4,6) needs exactly one bomb in these cells. But there are multiple unexplored cells here: (3,5), (3,6), (5,7). So it's unclear. Maybe this isn't the best place to look.\n\nLet's check another area. Looking at row 8, column 8 (8,8) is 1. The adjacent cells would be (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). (8,9) is 1, (9,8) is 1, (9,9) is . (unexplored). The 1 at (8,8) must have exactly one bomb in adjacent cells. Let's see if there are any flags here. The only adjacent flag could be in (7,7) or (9,9), but (7,7) is _, (9,9) is . So maybe the bomb is at (9,9). But since (9,9) is unexplored, we can't be sure. But this might not be the best lead.\n\nLooking back at row 5, column 7 (5,7) is unexplored. Let's check the cell (6,7) which is 1. The adjacent cells to (6,7) include (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). The 1 at (6,7) must have exactly one bomb in these cells. Let's see: (5,6) is 1, (5,7) is ., (5,8) is 1, (6,6) is 2, (6,8) is 1, (7,6) is 1, (7,7) is _, (7,8) is _. So the only unexplored cell adjacent to (6,7) is (5,7). So the 1 at (6,7) must have exactly one bomb in (5,7). Therefore, (5,7) must be a bomb. But wait, if that's the case, then we should place a flag there. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nBut wait, the flags remaining are 6. Let's count the existing flags. Looking through the board:\n\nRow 2: (2,5) is . (no flag)\n\nRow 5: (5,4) is F.\n\nRow 7: (7,4) and (7,5) are F.\n\nRow 8: (8,4) is F.\n\nRow 8: (8,5) is 3, no flag.\n\nRow 9: no flags.\n\nSo existing flags are at (5,4), (7,4), (7,5), (8,4). That's four flags. The game info says flags remaining: 6. Wait, but the total bombs are 10. So if there are 10 bombs, and 4 flags already placed, then 6 flags remaining. So that's correct. So placing a flag at (5,7) would use one of the remaining flags, leaving 5.\n\nBut according to the analysis of (6,7), the 1 there requires exactly one bomb in (5,7). So (5,7) must be a bomb. Therefore, we should place a flag there. Let's check if that's allowed.\n\nBut before placing a flag, we need to make sure that it doesn't conflict with other numbers. For example, the cell (5,6) is 1. The adjacent cells to (5,6) include (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). The 1 at (5,6) must have exactly one bomb. If we place a flag at (5,7), then that would be the bomb for (5,6). So that's okay. Also, the cell (5,8) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). If (5,7) is a bomb, then (5,8)'s adjacent bomb count would be 1 (from (5,7)), which matches the 1. So that's okay.\n\nAdditionally, the cell (6,6) is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). If (5,7) is a bomb, then (6,6) would have two bombs: (5,7) and (7,5) which is F. Wait, (7,5) is a flag. So (6,6) is 2, and already has a flag at (7,5). If (5,7) is also a bomb, then that's two bombs adjacent to (6,6), which matches the number 2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, placing a flag at (5,7) seems necessary. Let's check if there are any other constraints. For example, the cell (4,7) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). If (5,7) is a bomb, then the 1 at (4,7) would have that bomb as its only adjacent bomb. That's correct because (4,7) is 1. So that's okay.\n\nSo placing a flag at (5,7) seems to be a valid move. Let's check if there are any other possible moves. For example, looking at row 3, column 3 (3,3) is ., but adjacent to the 1 in row 3, column 2. Let's see. The cell (3,2) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). The 1 at (3,2) must have exactly one bomb. The cell (3,3) is ., so maybe that's a bomb. But there's a flag at (5,4), which is not adjacent. So perhaps (3,3) is a bomb. But how do we know? Let's see. The cell (4,3) is 2. Adjacent cells include (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). The 2 at (4,3) must have two bombs. The cell (5,4) is a flag, so that's one. The other could be (3,3) or (3,4). But (3,4) is ., and (3,3) is . So maybe there's a bomb there. But without more info, it's hard to tell. So maybe that's not the best move.\n\nAnother area to check is row 8, column 2 (8,2) is _. Wait, no, row 8, column 2 is _, which is empty. So nothing there.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 9 (9,9) is ., which is unexplored. The cell (9,8) is 1. Adjacent cells include (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9). The 1 at (9,8) must have exactly one bomb. The unexplored cell here is (9,9). So (9,9) could be a bomb. But we don't have enough info yet. So maybe not the best move.\n\nAnother possible area is row 7, column 2 (7,2) is _. Wait, no, row 7, column 2 is _, which is empty. So nothing there.\n\nSo the most certain move seems to be placing a flag at (5,7) because the 1 at (6,7) requires exactly one bomb there, and there's no other possible cell adjacent to (6,7) that could be a bomb. Therefore, (5,7) must be a bomb, and placing a flag there is correct.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. The cell (6,7) is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(5,6) is 1\n\n(5,7) is .\n\n(5,8) is 1\n\n(6,6) is 2\n\n(6,8) is 1\n\n(7,6) is 1\n\n(7,7) is _\n\n(7,8) is _\n\nSo the only unexplored cell adjacent to (6,7) is (5,7). Therefore, (5,7) must be the bomb. So placing a flag there is correct. This would satisfy the 1 at (6,7) and also the 2 at (6,6) (since (5,7) is a bomb and (7,5) is a flag, totaling two bombs adjacent to (6,6)).\n\nTherefore, the next move should be placing a flag at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (6,7) is a 1, which must have exactly one adjacent bomb. The only unexplored adjacent cell is (5,7), so it must be a bomb. Placing a flag here satisfies the number and aligns with adjacent cells' requirements.\n\nMOVE: 5,7,true", "flags_remaining": 6, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 . . . 1 _ _ _\n4 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 . 1 _\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _\n7 . 1 _ 2 F F 1 _ _ _\n8 . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\n9 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 3, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next safe move. Let me start by analyzing the current state of the board and the game info provided.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 5 flags remaining. The board state shows some revealed numbers, unexplored spaces (.), flags (F), and empty spaces (_). \n\nLooking at the coordinates, I need to check each revealed number to see if they have the correct number of adjacent flags. Let's start with the areas that have numbers and flags already placed.\n\nStarting with row 4, column 4 (4,4) is a '2'. Wait, no, let me check the board again. Let me parse the board row by row.\n\nRow 0: All underscores except maybe some unexplored? Wait, the board state shows:\n\nRow 0: all underscores except maybe some? Wait, looking at the given board:\n\nRow 0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 1: _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 2: _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 3: _ _ 1 . . . 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 4: 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n\nRow 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _\n\nRow 6: . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _\n\nRow 7: . 1 _ 2 F F 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 8: . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\n\nRow 9: . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .\n\nSo, looking at row 5, there's an F at (5,4) and (5,7). Similarly, row 7 has Fs at (7,4) and (7,5). Row 8 has F at (8,4). \n\nNow, let's check the numbers adjacent to these flags to see if they are satisfied. For example, in row 5, the cell at (5,5) is a 1. The adjacent cells include (5,4) which is a flag. So that 1 should have exactly one bomb, which is already accounted for by the flag. Therefore, the other adjacent cells around (5,5) should be safe. Let's check the adjacent cells to (5,5). The cells around (5,5) would be (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). But (5,4) is a flag. The cell (5,5) is 1, so there should be exactly one bomb. Since there's already a flag there, the other adjacent cells should be safe. But let's check if those cells are already revealed. For example, (4,4) is 2, (4,5) is 1, (4,6) is 1. (5,6) is 1. (6,4) is 3, (6,5) is 3, (6,6) is 2. So all those are already revealed. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at row 6, cell (6,5) is 3. The adjacent cells would include (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). The flags at (5,4) and (5,7) are not adjacent to (6,5). Wait, (5,4) is adjacent to (6,5)? Let's see: (6,5) is row 6, column 5. Adjacent cells would be row 5-7 and column 4-6. So (5,4) is adjacent. (5,5) is adjacent. (5,6) is adjacent. (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). So (5,4) is a flag, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is 1. (6,4) is 2, (6,6) is 2. (7,4) is F, (7,5) is F, (7,6) is 1. So the cell (6,5) is 3. The adjacent flags are (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). Wait, (5,4) is a flag, (7,4) and (7,5) are flags. So that's three flags. But (6,5) is 3, which means exactly three bombs adjacent. So that's correct. So those flags are properly placed.\n\nNow, looking for possible conflicts. Let's check the cell at (8,5) which is 3. The adjacent cells would include (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). The flags at (7,4), (7,5), (8,4). So three flags. The cell (8,5) is 3, so that's correct. No conflict here.\n\nLooking at row 7, cell (7,6) is 1. The adjacent cells would include (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). The flags at (7,5) and (7,4) are adjacent? Wait, (7,5) is adjacent to (7,6). So (7,5) is a flag. So the cell (7,6) is 1, which should have exactly one bomb. The flag at (7,5) is adjacent, so that's the one bomb. Therefore, all other adjacent cells should be safe. Let's check the adjacent cells. (6,5) is 3, (6,6) is 2, (6,7) is 1. (7,5) is F, (7,7) is empty (since row 7, column 7 is _). (8,5) is 3, (8,6) is 1, (8,7) is empty. So the cell (7,6) is 1 with a flag adjacent. So the other cells around it should be safe. For example, (7,7) is empty, but maybe it's already revealed. Wait, looking at row 7, the cells are: . 1 _ 2 F F 1 _ _ _. So (7,6) is 1, (7,7) is _, which is an empty revealed space. So that's already safe. So no problem here.\n\nNow, looking for cells that might have a number that's not matching the adjacent flags. Let's check cell (5,3) which is 1. The adjacent cells would be (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (5,4) is a flag. So the cell (5,3) is 1, which should have exactly one bomb. The flag at (5,4) is adjacent, so that's the bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent cells should be safe. Let's check if any of them are unexplored. For example, (5,2) is _, which is empty. (6,2) is _, (6,3) is 2. So all adjacent cells except (5,4) are either revealed or empty. So no conflict here.\n\nLooking at cell (6,3) which is 2. The adjacent cells would include (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). The flags at (5,4) and (7,4). So two flags. The cell (6,3) is 2, which matches. So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking for cells where the number of adjacent flags is less than the number, indicating that there are more bombs to be found. For example, cell (8,5) is 3 with three adjacent flags, so that's correct. \n\nAnother example: cell (6,4) is 3. Adjacent flags would be (5,4) and (7,4), (7,5). Wait, (5,4) is a flag, (7,4) and (7,5) are flags. So three flags. So (6,4) is 3, which matches. Correct.\n\nWhat about cell (4,3) which is 2. Adjacent cells: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). The flags at (5,4). So one flag. The cell is 2, so there should be one more bomb. Let's check the adjacent unexplored cells. (3,3) and (3,4) are . (unexplored). So those could be possible bombs. But since the cell (4,3) is 2 and only one flag is adjacent, there must be one more bomb in the adjacent cells. But how can we determine where?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that has a number which is already satisfied by existing flags, so the remaining adjacent cells can be safely revealed.\n\nLooking at cell (5,7) which is F. Let's check the numbers around it. For example, cell (5,6) is 1. The adjacent cells include (5,7) which is a flag. So that 1 is satisfied. So the other cells around (5,6) should be safe. Let's check. The adjacent cells to (5,6) are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (5,7) is F. (4,5) is 1, (4,6) is 1, (4,7) is 1. (5,5) is 1, (6,5) is 3, (6,6) is 2, (6,7) is 1. All these are revealed. So no unexplored cells here. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at row 8, cell (8,8) is 1. The adjacent cells would include (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). The cell (8,8) is 1. Are there any flags adjacent? Let's see. (7,7) is _, (7,8) is _, (7,9) is _, (8,7) is _, (8,9) is 1, (9,7) is _, (9,8) is 1, (9,9) is . So no flags adjacent. So there must be one bomb in the adjacent cells. The unexplored cells here are (9,9). But (9,9) is . in row 9. So maybe that's a possible bomb. But we can't be sure yet.\n\nLooking for cells that have a number equal to the number of adjacent unexplored cells plus flags. For example, if a cell has a number N and there are N unexplored cells adjacent, then all those unexplored cells must be bombs. Let's look for such cases.\n\nTake cell (3,2) which is 1. The adjacent cells: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). The cell (3,2) is 1. The adjacent unexplored cells are (2,1) and (3,3), (3,1). Let's check:\n\nRow 2: columns 1 is _, column 2 is 1, column 3 is 1. Wait, row 2 is: _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _. So (2,1) is _, (2,2) is 1, (2,3) is 1. So (2,1) is empty, not unexplored. Wait, the legend says _ is empty revealed space. So (2,1) is empty. So (3,1) is _, which is empty. (3,3) is . (unexplored). (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1, (4,3) is 2. So the only unexplored adjacent cell to (3,2) is (3,3). The cell (3,2) is 1, so there must be exactly one bomb in adjacent cells. The only unexplored cell is (3,3). So that must be a bomb. Therefore, we can place a flag there. But wait, the flags remaining are 5. Let's check if placing a flag here would conflict with any other numbers.\n\nIf we place a flag at (3,3), then check adjacent cells. The cell (3,2) is 1, which would now have one flag (correct). The cell (2,3) is 1. Adjacent cells to (2,3) include (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). If (3,3) is a flag, then (2,3) is 1, which would have that flag. So that's okay. The cell (3,4) is . (unexplored). So placing a flag at (3,3) would satisfy (3,2)'s 1. But we need to check if that's allowed. Since (3,3) is unexplored, and the number in (3,2) requires exactly one bomb, which would be (3,3), this seems like a valid flag placement. So this is a possible move.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there are other cells that might require that (3,3) not be a bomb. For example, cell (4,3) is 2. The adjacent cells include (3,3). If (3,3) is a bomb, then (4,3) would have that plus any others. Let's see. (4,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). Currently, (5,4) is a flag. If (3,3) is a flag, then (4,3) would have two flags: (3,3) and (5,4). But (4,3) is 2, which would be correct. So that's okay. So placing a flag at (3,3) would satisfy both (3,2) and (4,3). So that seems valid.\n\nAnother possible spot: cell (2,5) is . (unexplored). Let's check the numbers around it. The cell (2,4) is 2. Adjacent to (2,4) are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (2,4) is 2. The adjacent unexplored cells are (2,5) and (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). But (3,3) is . and (3,4) is . and (3,5) is . So (2,4) is 2. How many flags are adjacent? Currently, none. So there must be two bombs in those unexplored cells. But without more info, it's hard to tell. However, if we already determined that (3,3) is a bomb, then (2,4) would have one bomb (3,3) and need another. But this is getting complicated. Let's focus back on the (3,3) cell.\n\nIf (3,3) is a bomb, then (3,2) is satisfied. Also, (4,3) would have one bomb (3,3) and another from (5,4), but (4,3) is 2. Wait, (5,4) is a flag, which is adjacent to (4,3). So (4,3) has two bombs: (3,3) and (5,4). But (4,3) is 2, which matches. So that's correct. So placing a flag at (3,3) seems safe.\n\nAnother possible area: cell (7,2) is . (unexplored). Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (7,1) is 1. Adjacent cells to (7,1) include (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (7,1) is 1. The adjacent unexplored cells are (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2). (6,0) is . (row 6, column 0 is .), (6,1) is 1, (6,2) is _, (7,0) is ., (7,2) is ., (8,0) is ., (8,1) is 1, (8,2) is _. So (7,1) is 1. The only adjacent flags are none. So there must be exactly one bomb in the adjacent unexplored cells. But there are multiple unexplored cells here, so we can't determine which one is the bomb. So this area is not helpful yet.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 9 is . (unexplored). The cell (9,8) is 1. Adjacent cells include (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9). (9,8) is 1. The adjacent unexplored cells are (9,9). So (9,9) must be the bomb. But we have 5 flags remaining and 10 bombs. Let's check how many flags are already placed. Let's count the Fs on the board:\n\nRow 5: (5,4) and (5,7) \u2192 2 flags.\n\nRow 7: (7,4) and (7,5) \u2192 2 flags.\n\nRow 8: (8,4) \u2192 1 flag.\n\nTotal flags placed: 5. But the game info says flags remaining: 5. Wait, the total bombs are 10. So if 5 flags are already placed, but there are 10 bombs, then we need to place 5 more flags. But the flags remaining is 5. So that's correct. So all placed flags are correct? Or maybe some are incorrect. Wait, the flags remaining is 5, which means that the user has placed 5 flags (since total bombs are 10, and flags remaining is 5, so 10 - 5 = 5 flags already placed). Wait, no. The flags remaining is the number of flags left to place. So if there are 10 bombs, and the user has placed 5 flags, then flags remaining would be 10 - 5 = 5. Wait, no. The flags remaining is the number of flags you can still place. So if you have 10 bombs, and you have placed 5 flags, then you have 5 flags remaining. So the total flags you can place is 10. But the current flags on the board are 5 (as per the count above: 2 in row 5, 2 in row 7, 1 in row 8 \u2192 total 5). So flags remaining is 5. So that's correct.\n\nSo if we place a flag at (3,3), that would use one of the remaining flags, bringing it down to 4. But we need to make sure that this is a valid flag.\n\nAnother possible move: cell (9,9) is unexplored. The cell (9,8) is 1. Adjacent cells are (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,9). (9,8) is 1. The only unexplored cell here is (9,9). So (9,9) must be a bomb. So placing a flag there. But since flags remaining is 5, and we have 5 flags left, that's possible. But we need to check if that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the cell (9,8) is 1. If (9,9) is a bomb, then that's the only adjacent bomb. So that's correct. So placing a flag at (9,9) would be valid. But is there any conflict? Let's check adjacent cells. (9,9) is adjacent to (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). (8,9) is 1. So (8,9) is 1. If we place a flag at (9,9), then (8,9) would have that as an adjacent bomb. But (8,9) is 1. So that's correct. So placing a flag at (9,9) would satisfy (9,8) and (8,9). But (8,9) is 1, which would have one bomb at (9,9). So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, (8,9) is 1. Adjacent cells include (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9). If (9,9) is a flag, then (8,9) is 1, which is correct. So that's okay.\n\nSo possible moves are placing flags at (3,3) or (9,9). But which one is more certain?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be safely revealed. Let's look for cells where the number of adjacent flags equals the cell's number, so the remaining adjacent cells can be revealed.\n\nFor example, cell (6,4) is 3. Adjacent flags are (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). So three flags. So all bombs are accounted for. Therefore, any adjacent unexplored cells can be safely revealed. Let's check adjacent cells to (6,4). The adjacent cells are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). All of these are either revealed or flagged. So no unexplored cells here. So nothing to reveal here.\n\nAnother example: cell (8,5) is 3. Adjacent flags are (7,4), (7,5), (8,4). So three flags. All adjacent cells are either revealed or flagged. So nothing to reveal here.\n\nLooking at cell (5,5) is 1. Adjacent flags are (5,4). So the other cells around it are safe. But all adjacent cells are already revealed.\n\nLooking at cell (7,6) is 1. Adjacent flag is (7,5). So other cells are safe, but they are already revealed.\n\nLooking for cells where the number of adjacent flags is equal to the cell's number, so the remaining adjacent cells can be revealed. Let's check cell (4,4) which is 2. Adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). The flags at (5,4). So one flag. The cell is 2, so there should be one more bomb. The unexplored cells here are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So until those are resolved, we can't proceed.\n\nAnother cell: (6,6) is 2. Adjacent cells: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). Flags at (5,7) and (7,5). So two flags. The cell (6,6) is 2, so that's correct. All adjacent cells are revealed except (7,7), which is empty. So nothing to do here.\n\nLooking at cell (8,6) is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). Flags at (7,5) and (8,5) is 3 (but (8,5) is a number). Wait, (8,5) is 3. Adjacent flags are (7,4), (7,5), (8,4). So (7,5) is a flag. So (8,6) is 1. The adjacent flags are (7,5). So that's one bomb. So the other cells should be safe. The adjacent unexplored cells are (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). (9,5) is 1, (9,6) is 1, (9,7) is _. So no unexplored cells here. So nothing to do.\n\nAnother area to check: row 5, column 2 is _. But that's empty. Not helpful.\n\nLooking back to the earlier idea of placing a flag at (3,3). Let's verify again. Cell (3,2) is 1. Adjacent unexplored is (3,3). So that must be a bomb. So placing a flag there is correct. Also, cell (4,3) is 2. Adjacent flags would be (3,3) and (5,4). So two flags, which matches the number. So that's correct. No conflicts here.\n\nAnother possible flag is at (3,4). Let's see. Cell (3,2) is 1, which is satisfied by (3,3). Cell (2,4) is 2. Adjacent unexplored cells are (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). If (3,3) is a bomb, then (2,4) needs one more. But without more info, can't determine.\n\nAlternatively, cell (3,5) is unexplored. Cell (2,5) is unexplored. But not sure.\n\nSo the safest move seems to be placing a flag at (3,3). But let's check if there's any other cell that can be safely revealed.\n\nLooking at cell (5,2) which is _. Adjacent to (5,2) are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). All these are revealed. So (5,2) is already empty. Not helpful.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 0 is . (unexplored). Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (5,1) is 1. Adjacent cells include (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (5,1) is 1. The adjacent unexplored cells are (5,0), (6,0). So there must be one bomb among these. But without more info, can't determine which. So this area is risky.\n\nAnother possible safe reveal: cell (3,3) is unexplored. If we can't place a flag there, maybe we can reveal it. But if it's a bomb, the game ends. But according to the analysis, it should be a bomb. So placing a flag is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be safely revealed based on existing numbers and flags.\n\nLooking at cell (9,0) is . (row 9, column 0). Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (8,0) is . (unexplored), (9,1) is 1. The cell (9,1) is 1. Adjacent cells include (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,0), etc. (But board is 10x10, so row 9 is the last). So (9,1) is 1. The adjacent unexplored cells are (8,0), (9,0), (9,2). (9,2) is _. So (8,0) and (9,0) are unexplored. So there must be one bomb among them. But without more info, can't determine.\n\nAnother area: row 8, column 7 is _. Adjacent to (8,7) are (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). (8,7) is empty. So nothing to do here.\n\nBack to the initial idea: placing a flag at (3,3) seems safe. Let's check if there's any reason not to. For example, cell (3,4) is . (unexplored). If (3,3) is a bomb, then cell (3,4) could be another bomb. But cell (3,2) is 1, which is satisfied by (3,3). Cell (4,3) is 2, which would have bombs at (3,3) and (5,4). So that's correct. Cell (2,3) is 1. Adjacent cells include (3,3). So if (3,3) is a bomb, then (2,3) is satisfied. But (2,3) is 1, which would have exactly one bomb. So that's correct. So placing a flag at (3,3) is valid.\n\nAnother possible move is revealing cell (3,3). But that's risky if it's a bomb. But according to the analysis, it should be a bomb, so revealing it would lose the game. So placing a flag is the correct move.\n\nSo the next move should be placing a flag at (3,3). Let's confirm the coordinates. The cell is row 3, column 3. So x=3, y=3, flag=true.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (3,2) is a 1 with only one adjacent unexplored cell (3,3). Since the number 1 indicates exactly one bomb, (3,3) must be a bomb. Placing a flag here satisfies the adjacent numbers and follows the rules.\n\nMOVE: 3,3,true", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 . . . 1 _ _ _\n4 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _\n7 . 1 _ 2 F F 1 _ _ _\n8 . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\n9 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 7, "y": 6, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next move without hitting a bomb. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 4 flags remaining. Let me start by scanning the board for any obvious patterns or numbers that can help determine where bombs are or safe spots to reveal.\n\nFirst, looking at the revealed numbers. Let's check each number to see if the adjacent flags match the number. For example, if a cell has a '1' and there's already a flag next to it, then all other adjacent cells must be safe. Similarly, if a cell has a '2' and only one flag nearby, there must be another bomb adjacent.\n\nStarting with row 2, column 5 (2,5) which is a '.', but the cell (2,5) is actually a '.' meaning it's unexplored. Wait, no, looking at the board state:\n\nRow 2 shows: 2 _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\nWait, maybe I need to parse the board correctly. Let me re-express the board state row by row to avoid confusion.\n\nRow 0: all underscores (empty revealed)\nRow 1: underscores until columns 4,5,6 are 1s, then underscores.\nRow 2: _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\nWait, row 2, column 5 is a '.' (unexplored). The cell (2,5) is unexplored. But the cell (2,4) is 2. Let's check adjacent cells for that 2. The 2 at (2,4) (row 2, column 4) has to have exactly two bombs around it. Let's see what's adjacent to (2,4). The adjacent cells would be:\n\nLooking at the cells around (2,4):\n\nRow 1: columns 3,4,5 (since row 2 is current row). So (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2: columns 3,4,5: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: columns 3,4,5: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nWait, but (2,4) is in row 2, column 4. So adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,5),\n(2,3),        (2,5),\n(3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nLooking at these cells:\n\nRow 1, column 4 is 1. So (1,4) is a 1. But (2,4) is a 2. Let's check if there are any flags around (2,4). The cell (3,3) is flagged (F). So (3,3) is a flag. Are there any other flags? Let's check the board again.\n\nLooking at row 3: _ _ 1 F . . 1 _ _ _\nSo (3,3) is F. So that's one flag adjacent to (2,4). The 2 at (2,4) requires two bombs. So there must be another bomb in the adjacent cells. The other adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,3): row 1, column 3 is '_', which is empty. (1,4) is 1. (1,5) is 1. (2,3) is 1. (2,5) is '.' (unexplored). (3,3) is F. (3,4) is '.' (unexplored). (3,5) is '.' (unexplored). \n\nSo the 2 at (2,4) has one flag (F at 3,3) and needs another bomb. The possible cells for the second bomb are (2,5), (3,4), (3,5). Let's see if any of these can be determined.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4 and 5 are '.' (unexplored). The cell (3,4) is '.' and (3,5) is '.'.\n\nNow, looking at row 3, column 2 is 1. The cell (3,2) is 1, which is adjacent to (3,3) (F). So the 1 at (3,2) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since there's already a flag at (3,3), that's the only bomb. Therefore, the other cells adjacent to (3,2) must be safe. The adjacent cells to (3,2) are:\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3),\n(3,1),        (3,3),\n(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nLooking at these, (3,3) is F. The cell (4,3) is 2. The others: (2,3) is 1, (4,2) is 1, etc. So the 1 at (3,2) is satisfied by the flag at (3,3). Therefore, the cells adjacent to (3,2) other than (3,3) must be safe. So (3,4) and (3,5) are adjacent to (3,3) but not directly to (3,2). Wait, maybe I need to check another angle.\n\nWait, the 1 at (3,2) has adjacent cells. The cell (3,3) is F, so that's the bomb. Therefore, all other adjacent cells to (3,2) must be safe. So (3,4) is adjacent to (3,3) but not to (3,2). Wait, (3,4) is adjacent to (3,3)? No, (3,4) is next to (3,3) in the same row. So (3,3) is column 3, (3,4) is column 4. So (3,4) is adjacent to (3,3) but not part of the adjacent cells for (3,2). Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the 2 at (2,4) needing another bomb. The possible cells are (2,5), (3,4), (3,5). Let's see if any of these can be determined through other numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4 and 5 are unexplored. Let's check if there's any other number that can influence these cells. For example, the cell (3,6) is 1. The 1 at (3,6) (row 3, column 6) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent cells would be:\n\n(2,5), (2,6), (2,7),\n(3,5),        (3,7),\n(4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\nLooking at these, (3,5) is '.' (unexplored), (2,5) is '.' (unexplored), (4,5) is 1. So the 1 at (3,6) must have one bomb in these cells. If (3,5) or (2,5) is a bomb, that could affect the count. But since (3,6) is 1, only one of those can be a bomb. But this might not directly help yet.\n\nBack to the 2 at (2,4). We need another bomb in (2,5), (3,4), or (3,5). Let's check if any of these cells are adjacent to other numbers that could help.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 4 is 2. The cell (4,4) is 2. Let's check adjacent cells. The adjacent cells would be:\n\n(3,3) F, (3,4) ., (3,5) .,\n(4,3) 2,        (4,5) 1,\n(5,3) 1, (5,4) F, (5,5) 1.\n\nSo (4,4) is 2. The adjacent flags are (3,3) F and (5,4) F. Wait, (5,4) is F. So that's two flags. But (4,4) is 2. So the two flags would account for the two bombs. Therefore, the other adjacent cells must be safe. So (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5) must be safe. But (3,4) and (3,5) are '.' unexplored. So according to this, (3,4) and (3,5) should be safe. But wait, the 2 at (4,4) has two adjacent flags (3,3 and 5,4), so those two flags are the bombs. Therefore, the other cells adjacent to (4,4) must not have bombs. That includes (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5). So (3,4) and (3,5) are safe. Therefore, the remaining bomb for the 2 at (2,4) must be in (2,5). Because (3,4) and (3,5) are safe, the only remaining possibility is (2,5). So (2,5) must be a bomb. Therefore, we can place a flag there. But wait, let's confirm.\n\nThe 2 at (2,4) needs two bombs. One is at (3,3) F, and the other must be at (2,5). Because (3,4) and (3,5) are safe (due to the 2 at (4,4) having two flags already). So (2,5) is a bomb. Therefore, we can flag (2,5). But let's check if that's possible. The cell (2,5) is currently '.' (unexplored). So placing a flag there would be valid. Also, flags remaining are 4, so we have enough.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's any conflict. If we place a flag at (2,5), does that affect any other numbers? Let's check adjacent cells to (2,5):\n\nAdjacent cells would be:\n\n(1,4), (1,5), (1,6),\n(2,4),        (2,6),\n(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\nLooking at these, (1,5) is 1. If we place a flag at (2,5), then the 1 at (1,5) would have that flag as adjacent. Let's check the 1 at (1,5). The adjacent cells to (1,5) are:\n\n(0,4), (0,5), (0,6),\n(1,4),        (1,6),\n(2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nCurrently, (2,5) is '.' and (2,4) is 2. If we place a flag at (2,5), then the 1 at (1,5) would have that flag as a bomb. But the 1 at (1,5) requires exactly one bomb. So if (2,5) is a bomb, that's okay. But are there any other bombs adjacent to (1,5)? Let's check. The other adjacent cells to (1,5) are (1,4) which is 1, (1,6) which is 1, (2,4) is 2, (2,6) is 1. None of those cells are flagged except (2,5) if we place a flag there. So the 1 at (1,5) would have exactly one bomb (the flag at (2,5)), which is correct. So no conflict there.\n\nAnother check: the cell (3,6) is 1. Adjacent cells include (2,5). If (2,5) is a bomb, then the 1 at (3,6) would have that bomb as adjacent, which is correct. So that's okay.\n\nSo placing a flag at (2,5) seems valid. That would account for the second bomb needed for the 2 at (2,4). Also, the 2 at (4,4) already has two flags (3,3 and 5,4), so the other cells around it are safe. Therefore, (3,4) and (3,5) are safe. So after placing the flag at (2,5), we can then reveal (3,4) and (3,5) as safe. But since flags remaining are 4, placing this flag would leave 3 flags remaining. But the total bombs are 10, and there are already some flags on the board. Let's count the existing flags.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 3: (3,3) F\nRow 5: (5,4) F, (5,7) F\nRow 7: (7,4) F, (7,5) F\nRow 8: (8,4) F\n\nWait, let's check each row:\n\nRow 3: column 3 is F.\nRow 5: columns 4 and 7 are F.\nRow 7: columns 4 and 5 are F.\nRow 8: column 4 is F.\n\nSo total flags on the board: 1 (row3) + 2 (row5) + 2 (row7) + 1 (row8) = 6 flags. But the game info says flags remaining: 4. Wait, that's a problem. Because the total bombs are 10, and flags placed are 6, but flags remaining are 4. That would mean total flags placed plus remaining is 10, which matches the total bombs. So 6 flags already placed, 4 remaining. So placing a flag here would decrease remaining to 3, which is okay.\n\nBut wait, the user said Flags remaining: 4. So the flags already placed are 10 - 4 = 6. So yes, 6 flags on the board. So placing a flag at (2,5) would be the 7th flag, but the total bombs are 10. Wait, no. The flags remaining is the number of flags left to place. So if there are 10 bombs, and 6 flags already placed, then flags remaining would be 10 - 6 = 4. So that's correct. So placing a flag here would use one of the remaining flags, leaving 3. So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, the user says Flags remaining: 4. So the total flags placed plus remaining should equal the total bombs (10). So 6 flags placed + 4 remaining = 10. So yes, correct.\n\nSo placing a flag at (2,5) is valid. But we need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with any other numbers. Let's check the cell (2,5) being a bomb. Are there any other numbers that would be affected?\n\nFor example, the cell (2,6) is 1. Adjacent cells to (2,6) would include (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). If (2,5) is a bomb, then the 1 at (2,6) would have that bomb as adjacent. But (3,6) is 1, which also has (2,5) as adjacent. Wait, (3,6) is 1. If (2,5) is a bomb, then (3,6) would have that bomb as adjacent. But (3,6) is 1, so that's okay. The 1 at (3,6) would have exactly one bomb (at 2,5). So that's correct.\n\nAnother check: the cell (1,5) is 1. Adjacent cells include (2,5). If (2,5) is a bomb, then that's the only bomb adjacent to (1,5), which is correct.\n\nSo placing a flag at (2,5) seems safe and correct. That would account for the second bomb needed for the 2 at (2,4). Also, this would leave the cells (3,4) and (3,5) as safe, which can be revealed later.\n\nAnother possible move: looking at row 8, column 9 is 1. The cell (8,9) is 1. Let's check adjacent cells. But maybe that's not as straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, column 2 is '_', which is empty. The cell (5,2) is '_', but adjacent cells might have numbers. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, column 9 is '_', but that's already revealed.\n\nAnother area to check is row 5, column 7 is F. The cell (5,7) is flagged. Let's check if that's correct. The cell (5,7) is adjacent to (4,6) which is 1, (4,7) which is 1, (5,6) which is 1, (5,8) which is 1, (6,6) which is 2, (6,7) which is 1, (6,8) which is 1. The number at (6,6) is 2. Let's see if the flag at (5,7) is correct. The 2 at (6,6) would need two bombs. The adjacent cells to (6,6) are:\n\n(5,5) 1, (5,6) 1, (5,7) F,\n(6,5) 3,        (6,7) 1,\n(7,5) F, (7,6) F, (7,7) 1.\n\nSo the 2 at (6,6) has two adjacent flags: (5,7) F and (7,5) F, (7,6) F. Wait, no. Adjacent cells to (6,6) are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). The flags at (5,7), (7,5), (7,6) are all adjacent. But the number at (6,6) is 2. So if there are three flags adjacent, that's a problem. Because the number is 2, but three flags would imply three bombs, which is a conflict. So this is a critical issue.\n\nWait, the cell (6,6) is 2. The adjacent cells include (5,7) F, (7,5) F, and (7,6) F. That's three flags. But the number is 2. This is a conflict. So this means that at least one of these flags is incorrectly placed. Therefore, this is a problem. So according to the rules, if there's a conflict like a number having more flags adjacent than the number, we need to address it.\n\nSo the 2 at (6,6) has three adjacent flags (5,7), (7,5), (7,6). That's three flags, but the number is 2. This is a conflict. Therefore, at least one of these flags is wrong. So we need to check which of these flags are incorrect.\n\nThis is a critical point. Let's analyze each flag:\n\n1. Flag at (5,7): Let's check if this is a valid bomb. The cell (5,7) is flagged. Let's see which numbers are adjacent to it. The adjacent cells to (5,7) are:\n\n(4,6) 1, (4,7) 1, (4,8) 1,\n(5,6) 1,        (5,8) 1,\n(6,6) 2, (6,7) 1, (6,8) 1.\n\nSo the 1 at (4,6) would have adjacent bombs. If (5,7) is a bomb, then the 1 at (4,6) must have exactly one bomb. Let's check adjacent cells to (4,6):\n\n(3,5) ., (3,6) 1, (3,7) .,\n(4,5) 1,        (4,7) 1,\n(5,5) 1, (5,6) 1, (5,7) F.\n\nSo the 1 at (4,6) has (5,7) as a possible bomb. If (5,7) is a bomb, then that's the only bomb adjacent to (4,6). That's okay. But other numbers may be affected.\n\nThe 1 at (5,6) is adjacent to (5,7) F. So if (5,7) is a bomb, then the 1 at (5,6) is satisfied. That's okay.\n\nThe 2 at (6,6) is adjacent to (5,7) F, which would count as one bomb. But the 2 at (6,6) has three flags, which is a problem. So if (5,7) is a bomb, then the 2 at (6,6) would have three bombs, which is impossible. Therefore, the flag at (5,7) must be incorrect. Similarly, the flags at (7,5) and (7,6) may also be incorrect.\n\nBut how to determine which flags are wrong. Let's look at each flag:\n\nFlag at (5,7): As above, if this is a bomb, then the 2 at (6,6) would have three bombs (including (5,7), (7,5), (7,6)), which is impossible. Therefore, at least one of these flags is wrong.\n\nFlag at (7,5): Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (7,5) is flagged. Adjacent cells:\n\n(6,4) 3, (6,5) 3, (6,6) 2,\n(7,4) F,         (7,6) F,\n(8,4) F, (8,5) 3, (8,6) 1.\n\nThe 3 at (6,4) is adjacent to (7,5) F. Let's see if that's valid. The 3 at (6,4) (row 6, column 4) is 3. Adjacent cells include (5,3) 1, (5,4) F, (5,5) 1, (6,3) 2, (6,5) 3, (7,3) 2, (7,4) F, (7,5) F. So the 3 at (6,4) has three bombs. The adjacent flags are (5,4) F, (7,4) F, (7,5) F. That's three flags, which matches the number 3. So that's correct. Therefore, the flag at (7,5) is correctly placed as part of the three bombs for (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, the flag at (7,6) is adjacent to (6,6) 2 and (7,5) F. Let's check the 2 at (6,6). If (7,6) is a bomb, then the 2 at (6,6) would have bombs at (5,7), (7,5), (7,6). But the number is 2, so this is a conflict. Therefore, the flag at (7,6) must be incorrect. But wait, the cell (7,6) is flagged. Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (7,6) is adjacent to:\n\n(6,5) 3, (6,6) 2, (6,7) 1,\n(7,5) F,         (7,7) 1,\n(8,5) 3, (8,6) 1, (8,7) . \n\nThe 3 at (6,5) is adjacent to (7,6) F. The 3 at (6,5) requires three bombs. The adjacent flags are (5,4) F, (7,5) F, (7,6) F. Wait, the 3 at (6,5) is in row 6, column 5. Adjacent cells:\n\n(5,4) F, (5,5) 1, (5,6) 1,\n(6,4) 3,        (6,6) 2,\n(7,4) F, (7,5) F, (7,6) F.\n\nSo the 3 at (6,5) has three adjacent flags: (5,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)? Wait, no. Let's list all adjacent cells:\n\n(5,4) F, (5,5) 1, (5,6) 1,\n(6,4) 3,        (6,6) 2,\n(7,4) F, (7,5) F, (7,6) F.\n\nSo the 3 at (6,5) has three adjacent flags: (5,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)? Wait, no. The adjacent cells are:\n\n- (5,4) F\n- (5,5) 1\n- (5,6) 1\n- (6,4) 3\n- (6,6) 2\n- (7,4) F\n- (7,5) F\n- (7,6) F\n\nSo the flags are (5,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). That's four flags. But the number is 3. So this is a conflict. Therefore, the 3 at (6,5) has four adjacent flags, which is impossible. Therefore, at least one of these flags is incorrect. But the 3 at (6,5) requires three bombs. So among the four flags adjacent, one must be wrong.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find which flags are incorrectly placed.\n\nFirst, the flag at (5,4) is part of the 3 at (6,5). Let's check if that's valid. The cell (5,4) is flagged. Adjacent cells to (5,4):\n\n(4,3) 2, (4,4) 2, (4,5) 1,\n(5,3) 1,        (5,5) 1,\n(6,3) 2, (6,4) 3, (6,5) 3.\n\nThe 2 at (4,3) requires two bombs. Adjacent flags include (5,4) F. Let's see. The 2 at (4,3) has adjacent cells:\n\n(3,2) 1, (3,3) F, (3,4) .,\n(4,2) 1,        (4,4) 2,\n(5,2) _, (5,3) 1, (5,4) F.\n\nSo the 2 at (4,3) has one flag at (3,3) and another at (5,4). That's two flags, which matches the number 2. So that's correct. Therefore, the flag at (5,4) is valid.\n\nThe flag at (7,4) is part of the 3 at (6,5). Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (7,4) is flagged. Adjacent cells:\n\n(6,3) 2, (6,4) 3, (6,5) 3,\n(7,3) 2,        (7,5) F,\n(8,3) 2, (8,4) F, (8,5) 3.\n\nThe 2 at (7,3) requires two bombs. Adjacent cells include (7,4) F. Let's check. The 2 at (7,3) has adjacent cells:\n\n(6,2) _, (6,3) 2, (6,4) 3,\n(7,2) _,        (7,4) F,\n(8,2) _, (8,3) 2, (8,4) F.\n\nSo the 2 at (7,3) has two flags: (7,4) F and (8,4) F. That's two flags, which matches the number 2. So that's correct. Therefore, the flag at (7,4) is valid.\n\nThe flag at (7,5) is part of the 3 at (6,5). We already checked that the 3 at (6,4) has three flags, which is correct. So the flag at (7,5) is valid.\n\nThe flag at (7,6) is part of the 3 at (6,5). But the 3 at (6,5) has four flags adjacent, which is a conflict. Therefore, the flag at (7,6) must be incorrect. So the flag at (7,6) is wrongly placed. Therefore, we should remove it.\n\nBut according to the rules, if there's a conflict, we should consider removing flags. So the flag at (7,6) is causing the 3 at (6,5) to have four flags, which is impossible. Therefore, (7,6) is not a bomb, and the flag there is incorrect. So we should remove it.\n\nBut how to confirm this. Let's check other numbers around (7,6). The cell (7,6) is flagged. If we remove the flag, then the 3 at (6,5) would have three flags: (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). That's three, which matches the number 3. So that's correct. The 2 at (6,6) would then have two flags: (5,7) and (7,5). But wait, the 2 at (6,6) is adjacent to (5,7) F, (7,5) F, and (7,6) (which we just removed). So after removing (7,6), the 2 at (6,6) has two flags: (5,7) and (7,5). That's two, which matches the number 2. So that's correct. Therefore, removing the flag at (7,6) resolves both conflicts.\n\nSo the flag at (7,6) is incorrect and should be removed. Therefore, the next move should be to remove the flag at (7,6). This would increase the flags remaining to 5 (since we had 4, and removing one gives back one). But according to the game info, flags remaining are 4. Wait, the flags remaining count is the number of flags left to place. So if there are 6 flags on the board, and total bombs are 10, then flags remaining is 10 - 6 = 4. If we remove a flag, flags on the board become 5, so flags remaining becomes 10 -5 =5. So yes, removing a flag increases the remaining count by 1.\n\nBut according to the rules, to remove a flag, we make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So to remove the flag at (7,6), we would send a move to (7,6) with flag=true. That would toggle the flag, removing it.\n\nBut why is the flag at (7,6) incorrect? Because the 3 at (6,5) has four flags adjacent, which is impossible. Removing this flag fixes that. Also, the 2 at (6,6) would then have two flags (5,7 and 7,5), which is correct. So this seems like a valid move.\n\nBut wait, the user's analysis steps say to first check all revealed numbers against existing flags. So step 1 is to check for conflicts. The conflict here is the 3 at (6,5) having four flags and the 2 at (6,6) having three flags. Removing the flag at (7,6) resolves both.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be to remove the flag at (7,6). This is a higher priority than placing new flags because existing flags are conflicting with numbers.\n\nSo the explanation would be that the flag at (7,6) is causing a conflict with the numbers 3 at (6,5) and 2 at (6,6), so it should be removed.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The flag at (7,6) is causing a conflict with the adjacent numbers. The '3' at (6,5) has four adjacent flags (including (7,6)), which exceeds its required count. Removing this flag resolves the conflict and aligns with the number constraints.\n\nMOVE: 7,6,true", "flags_remaining": 4, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 F . . 1 _ _ _\n4 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _\n7 . 1 _ 2 F F 1 _ _ _\n8 . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\n9 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next move, either placing a flag or revealing a tile. Let's start by analyzing the current state of the board and the given information.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10 with 10 bombs and 3 flags remaining. The board has some revealed numbers, flags, and unexplored areas (marked with .). Let's go through each area step by step.\n\nLooking at row 3, there's a flag at (3,3). The cell (3,4) is unexplored, and (3,5) is also unexplored. The number 1 at (3,6) might be important. Since there's a flag at (3,3), we need to check if adjacent numbers are satisfied.\n\nIn row 4, the cells (4,0) to (4,8) are mostly revealed. The cell (4,9) is empty. Let's check the numbers here. For example, (4,3) is a 2. The adjacent cells around it might have flags or bombs.\n\nLooking at row 5, there's a flag at (5,4) and (5,7). The cell (5,0) is unexplored. The number 1 at (5,3) and (5,5) might be relevant. The cell (5,2) is unexplored. Let's see if the existing flags satisfy the numbers here.\n\nRow 6 has a flag at (6,0) (but wait, no, (6,0) is a .). Wait, row 6 starts with . at (6,0), then 1 at (6,1), unexplored at (6,2), etc. The numbers here might indicate adjacent bombs. For example, (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3, (6,5) is 3. These numbers could be key in determining bomb locations.\n\nRow 7 has flags at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). The cell (7,3) is 2, and the cells around it might need to have bombs. But since there are already three flags adjacent to (7,3), maybe? Wait, (7,3) is 2. Let's check the adjacent cells. The cells around (7,3) would be (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). The flags at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are not adjacent to (7,3). Wait, (7,4) is adjacent to (7,3)? Let me check coordinates. For cell (7,3), adjacent cells are:\n\n- (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n- (7,2), (7,4)\n- (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)\n\nSo the flags at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are not adjacent to (7,3). The cell (7,4) is adjacent to (7,3), but (7,4) is a flag. So (7,3) is a 2, and there's a flag at (7,4). That means one bomb is accounted for. So there should be one more bomb adjacent to (7,3). Let's look at the other adjacent cells. The cell (6,4) is a 3, which is already revealed. So maybe (6,4) is a 3, which is correct because there are three bombs around it. Wait, (6,4) is 3. Let's check the adjacent cells to (6,4). They would be (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The flags at (5,4) and (5,7) are not adjacent. Wait, (5,4) is a flag. So (5,4) is adjacent to (6,4). So that's one bomb. Then (7,4) is a flag, which is adjacent to (6,4). So that's two bombs. And (7,5) is a flag, which is adjacent to (6,4). So three bombs. So (6,4) being 3 is satisfied. So that's okay.\n\nBack to (7,3) being 2. The adjacent cells are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). The flag at (7,4) is adjacent, so that's one bomb. So there must be one more bomb in the remaining cells. Let's check which of those are unexplored. (6,2) is unexplored (since row 6, column 2 is .). (6,3) is 2, which is revealed. (6,4) is 3. (7,2) is unexplored. (8,2) is unexplored. (8,3) is a flag. (8,4) is a flag. Wait, (8,3) is a flag? Let me check row 8. Row 8: . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1. So (8,4) is F (flag). So (8,4) is a flag. So (8,3) is 2, (8,4) is flag, (8,5) is 3. So for (7,3) being 2, the adjacent flags are (7,4) and (8,4)? Wait, (8,4) is adjacent to (7,3)? Let's see: (7,3) is row 7, column 3. The cell (8,4) is row 8, column 4. That's diagonally adjacent, so yes. So (7,3) has two adjacent flags: (7,4) and (8,4). But (7,3) is a 2. So that would account for both bombs. Wait, but (7,3) is 2, and there are two flags adjacent. So that's correct. So no problem here.\n\nWait, but (7,3) is 2, and adjacent flags are (7,4) and (8,4). So that's two bombs, which matches the number. So that's okay. So no conflict here.\n\nNow, looking for other areas. Let's check row 5. The cell (5,7) is a flag. Let's see the numbers around it. For example, (5,6) is 1. The adjacent cells to (5,6) would be (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). The flag at (5,7) is adjacent. So the 1 at (5,6) should have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since there's already a flag at (5,7), that's the one bomb. So the other adjacent cells should be safe. Let's check (6,7) which is 1. But (5,6) is 1, and (6,7) is 1. Hmm, maybe there's something here.\n\nLooking at row 8, cell (8,4) is a flag, and (8,5) is 3. Let's check the adjacent cells to (8,5). They would be (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). The flags at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4) are all adjacent. That's four flags. But (8,5) is 3, which would require three bombs. So this is a conflict. Wait, that's a problem. Because (8,5) is 3, but there are four flags adjacent. That's impossible. So this is a critical conflict. Wait, but according to the board state given, row 8 is:\n\n8 . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\n\nSo (8,4) is F (flag), (8,5) is 3. The adjacent cells to (8,5) are:\n\n- (7,4): F\n- (7,5): F\n- (7,6): F\n- (8,4): F\n- (8,6): 1\n- (9,4): 1\n- (9,5): 1\n- (9,6): . \n\nSo the flags at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), and (8,4) are all adjacent to (8,5). That's four flags. But (8,5) is 3. That's a conflict because the number 3 can't have four bombs adjacent. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrect. But according to the game's rules, each number must exactly match the number of adjacent bombs. So this is a critical issue. \n\nBut wait, the flags at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are part of a group. Let's check if those flags are correct. For example, (7,4) is a flag. Let's look at the cell (7,3) which is 2. We already checked that (7,3) has two adjacent flags, which matches its number. So (7,4) and (8,4) are flags. But (8,5) is 3 with four flags adjacent. That's a problem. So one of these flags must be wrong. \n\nBut how? Let's see. The cell (8,5) is 3. The adjacent cells are (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). The flags at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), and (8,4) are all considered bombs. But (8,5) says there are only three bombs. Therefore, one of these flags is incorrect. \n\nWhich one could it be? Let's check each flag:\n\n1. (7,4): Let's see if this flag is necessary. The cell (7,3) is 2. The adjacent cells to (7,3) are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). The flags at (7,4) and (8,4) are adjacent. So (7,3) is 2, which requires two bombs. So both (7,4) and (8,4) must be bombs. Therefore, those flags are correct. \n\n2. (7,5): Let's check the cell (7,5). The cell (7,5) is a flag. Let's look at adjacent numbers. For example, (6,5) is 3. The adjacent cells to (6,5) are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). The flags at (5,4), (7,5), (7,6) are present. (5,4) is a flag. So (6,5) is 3. The flags at (5,4), (7,5), (7,6) would account for three bombs. So that's correct. So (7,5) is a valid flag. \n\n3. (7,6): The cell (7,6) is a flag. Let's check adjacent numbers. For example, (6,6) is 2. The adjacent cells to (6,6) are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). The flags at (5,7) and (7,6) are present. (5,7) is a flag. (7,6) is a flag. So (6,6) is 2. So two bombs. That's correct. So (7,6) is a valid flag. \n\n4. (8,4): As discussed earlier, (8,4) is a flag. The cell (8,3) is 2. The adjacent cells to (8,3) are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). The flags at (7,4) and (8,4) are adjacent. So (8,3) is 2, which requires two bombs. So those flags are correct. \n\nSo all four flags adjacent to (8,5) are correct according to their respective numbers. But (8,5) is 3, which would require three bombs, but there are four flags. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the flags. But according to the current board state, how is this possible? \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let's recount the adjacent flags to (8,5). The cell (8,5) is at row 8, column 5. The adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,4): F\n- (7,5): F\n- (7,6): F\n- (8,4): F\n- (8,6): 1 (revealed)\n- (9,4): 1 (revealed)\n- (9,5): 1 (revealed)\n- (9,6): . (unexplored)\n\nSo four flags adjacent. But (8,5) is 3. That's impossible. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrect. But according to the other numbers, all flags are correctly placed. This suggests that there's a conflict, which must be resolved. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the current board state is given, and we have to work with that. So perhaps there's an error in the flags. But how? Let's check again. \n\nWait, maybe the cell (8,5) is not adjacent to all four flags. Let me confirm the coordinates again. (8,5) is row 8, column 5. The adjacent cells would be:\n\nRow 7: columns 4,5,6 (since row 8-1=7, columns 5-1=4 to 5+1=6)\nRow 8: columns 4 and 6\nRow 9: columns 4,5,6\n\nSo (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). \n\nSo the flags at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), and (8,4) are all adjacent to (8,5). So four flags. But (8,5) is 3. This is a conflict. Therefore, one of these flags is wrong. \n\nBut according to the other numbers, all these flags are correctly placed. For example, (7,4) is needed for (7,3) and (6,4). (7,5) is needed for (6,5). (7,6) is needed for (6,6). (8,4) is needed for (8,3). So all of them are required by their respective numbers. \n\nThis suggests that there's a contradiction in the current board state. But since the problem states that this is the current state, perhaps there's a mistake in the analysis. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo in the board state. But assuming the board state is correct as given, this is a problem. \n\nHowever, the user is asking for the next move based on the given board state. So perhaps there's another area where a flag can be placed or a tile revealed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the flags remaining are 3, but there are already several flags on the board. Let's count the existing flags. \n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 3: (3,3) F\nRow 5: (5,4) F, (5,7) F\nRow 7: (7,4) F, (7,5) F, (7,6) F\nRow 8: (8,4) F\n\nSo total flags: 1 (row3) + 2 (row5) + 3 (row7) + 1 (row8) = 7 flags. But the game info says flags remaining: 3. Wait, that's a problem. Because if there are 10 bombs, and flags placed are 7, then flags remaining should be 10 - 7 = 3. But according to the game info, flags remaining are 3. So that's correct. So total flags placed: 7. \n\nBut according to the board state, there are 7 flags. So that's okay. \n\nBut the conflict at (8,5) remains. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem setup. But since we have to proceed, maybe we should look for other areas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (8,5) is actually a 4, but it's displayed as 3. But according to the given board state, it's 3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flags at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are correct, and the flag at (8,4) is incorrect. But (8,4) is needed for (8,3) which is 2. So (8,3) is 2, and the adjacent flags are (7,4) and (8,4). So if (8,4) is not a bomb, then (8,3) would have only one bomb (from (7,4)), which would be a conflict. Therefore, (8,4) must be a bomb. \n\nThis suggests that the problem is unsolvable, but since the user is asking for a move, perhaps there's another area to look at. \n\nLet's look for other areas where we can safely place a flag or reveal a tile. \n\nLooking at row 2, cell (2,5) is a . (unexplored). The cell (2,4) is 2. Let's check the adjacent cells. The cell (2,4) is 2. The adjacent cells would be (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). \n\nThe cell (3,3) is a flag. So that's one bomb. The cell (2,5) is unexplored. So there must be one more bomb in the remaining adjacent cells. The other cells: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5). \n\n(1,4) is 1, (1,5) is 1, (2,3) is 1, (3,4) is ., (3,5) is . \n\nSo the remaining bomb could be in (3,4) or (3,5) or (1,3), etc. But this area is a bit complex. \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 4, cell (4,9) is empty. The cell (4,8) is 1. The adjacent cells to (4,8) would be (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). The cell (5,7) is a flag, which is adjacent to (4,8). So the 1 at (4,8) requires exactly one bomb. Since there's a flag at (5,7), that's the one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent cells (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,8), (5,9) must be safe. So (4,9) is empty, but (5,9) is . (unexplored). So perhaps (5,9) can be revealed. \n\nBut (5,9) is in row 5, column 9. The cell (5,9) is . Let's check if it's safe. Since (4,8) is 1 and has a flag at (5,7), the other cells around (4,8) should be safe. So (5,9) is adjacent to (4,8) and (5,8). (5,8) is 1. So (5,9) could be safe. \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9, cell (9,9) is . The cell (8,9) is 1. The adjacent cells to (8,9) are (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9). The cell (9,9) is unexplored. Since (8,9) is 1, there must be one bomb in those adjacent cells. The cell (9,9) is one of them. But we don't have any flags here yet. \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, cell (5,2) is unexplored. The cell (5,1) is 1, (5,3) is 1. Let's check the adjacent cells to (5,1). The cell (5,1) is 1. The adjacent cells would be (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). The cell (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1. (5,0) is ., (5,2) is ., (6,0) is ., (6,1) is 1, (6,2) is . \n\nThe 1 at (5,1) requires exactly one bomb in these cells. Let's see if there's a flag already. There are no flags in these cells. So one of these cells must be a bomb. But since there are multiple unexplored cells, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, cell (6,2) is unexplored. The cell (6,3) is 2. The adjacent cells to (6,3) are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). The cell (5,4) is a flag. So that's one bomb. The cell (6,3) is 2, so there must be one more bomb in the remaining cells. The remaining cells are (5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,3) is 1, (6,4) is 3, (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is flag. So the remaining bomb could be in (5,2) or (6,2) or (7,2). \n\nBut (5,2) is unexplored, (6,2) is unexplored, (7,2) is unexplored. So perhaps one of these is a bomb. But without more info, it's hard to tell. \n\nLooking at row 7, cell (7,7) is unexplored. The cell (7,7) is . The cell (7,6) is a flag. The cell (7,7) is adjacent to (6,6) which is 2, (6,7) which is 1, (7,6) which is flag, (8,6) which is 1, (8,7) which is . \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8, cell (8,7) is unexplored. The cell (8,6) is 1. The adjacent cells to (8,6) are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). The cell (7,5) and (7,6) are flags, (8,5) is 3. So the 1 at (8,6) requires one bomb. The flags at (7,5) and (7,6) are adjacent. So if those flags are correct, then (8,6) would have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts the 1. Wait, this is another conflict. \n\nWait, (8,6) is 1. The adjacent cells are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). The flags at (7,5) and (7,6) are adjacent. So that's two bombs. But (8,6) is 1. This is another conflict. \n\nSo now we have two conflicts: (8,5) is 3 with four adjacent flags, and (8,6) is 1 with two adjacent flags. This suggests that the flags at (7,5) and/or (7,6) are incorrect. But earlier analysis suggested they were correct. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a safe move elsewhere. \n\nLooking at row 9, cell (9,6) is unexplored. The cell (9,5) is 1. The adjacent cells to (9,5) are (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (9,4) is 1, (8,4) is flag, (8,5) is 3, (8,6) is 1. So the 1 at (9,5) requires one bomb. The flag at (8,4) is adjacent. So that's one bomb. Therefore, the other cells (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6) must be safe. So (9,6) can be safely revealed. \n\nBut (9,6) is unexplored. So revealing (9,6) would be safe. \n\nAlternatively, looking at cell (9,9) which is unexplored. The cell (8,9) is 1. The adjacent cells to (8,9) are (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9). The 1 at (8,9) requires one bomb among these. There are no flags here yet. So one of these cells is a bomb. But without more info, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, cell (5,0) is unexplored. The cell (5,1) is 1. The adjacent cells to (5,1) include (5,0). So maybe (5,0) is a bomb. But since there's a flag at (5,4) and (5,7), and flags remaining are 3, perhaps we can place a flag here. But we need to verify. \n\nBut the cell (5,0) is unexplored. The cell (4,0) is 1. The adjacent cells to (4,0) are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). The cell (4,0) is 1. There's a flag at (3,3), but that's not adjacent. So the bomb could be in (3,0), (3,1), (5,0), or (5,1). But (5,1) is 1, which is already revealed. So (5,1) is safe. Therefore, the bomb must be in (3,0), (3,1), or (5,0). But without more info, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 0, all cells are empty except for unexplored. But since the game is 10x10 with 10 bombs, and most of the bombs are already flagged (7 flags), there are 3 remaining bombs. \n\nWait, the total bombs are 10, and there are 7 flags already placed. So 3 bombs remain unflagged. \n\nLooking for areas where the remaining bombs could be. \n\nThe unexplored cells are scattered. For example, in row 3, cells (3,4) and (3,5) are unexplored. The cell (3,6) is 1. The adjacent cells to (3,6) are (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). The cell (2,5) is unexplored, (3,5) is unexplored. The 1 at (3,6) requires one bomb. There's a flag at (3,3), but that's not adjacent. So the bomb could be in (2,5) or (3,5) or (4,5), etc. But (4,5) is 1, which is revealed. So (4,5) is safe. \n\nSo the bomb must be in (2,5) or (3,5). But (2,5) is unexplored. If we can determine which one is the bomb, we can place a flag. \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 2, cell (2,5) is unexplored. The cell (2,4) is 2. The adjacent cells to (2,4) are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). The flag at (3,3) is adjacent. So one bomb. Therefore, there must be one more bomb in the remaining cells. The cell (2,5) is unexplored. So if we can determine that (2,5) is a bomb, we can flag it. \n\nBut how? The cell (2,5) is adjacent to (2,4) which is 2. If (2,5) is a bomb, then the cell (1,5) which is 1 would have two bombs adjacent (since (1,5) is adjacent to (2,5) and possibly others). Let's check. \n\nThe cell (1,5) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). If (2,5) is a bomb, then (1,5) would have at least one bomb (from (2,5)). But (1,5) is 1, so there can't be more than one bomb adjacent. So if (2,5) is a bomb, then the other adjacent cells to (1,5) must have no bombs. \n\nBut (1,4) is 1, (1,6) is 1. The cell (2,4) is 2. So (2,4) has two bombs adjacent. One is (3,3) flag, and another could be (2,5). So if (2,5) is a bomb, then (2,4) would have two bombs: (3,3) and (2,5). That's correct. \n\nBut then (1,5) would have one bomb (from (2,5)), which matches its number. So that's okay. \n\nSo perhaps (2,5) is a bomb. But how to confirm? \n\nAlternatively, the cell (3,5) is unexplored. If (3,5) is a bomb, then the cell (3,6) which is 1 would have one bomb, which is correct. But then the cell (2,5) would not be a bomb, and (2,4) would need another bomb elsewhere. \n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. \n\nLet's look for a safe move. \n\nLooking at row 5, cell (5,9) is unexplored. As mentioned earlier, the cell (4,8) is 1 with a flag at (5,7). So the other cells around (4,8) should be safe. Therefore, (5,9) can be safely revealed. \n\nSo the move would be to reveal (5,9). \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9, cell (9,6) is unexplored. The cell (9,5) is 1, and the adjacent flag at (8,4) accounts for the one bomb. So (9,6) should be safe. \n\nAnother option is cell (9,9), which is unexplored. The cell (8,9) is 1, so one bomb in its adjacent cells. But without flags, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, cell (6,7) is 1. The adjacent cells are (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). The flag at (5,7) is adjacent. So the 1 at (6,7) requires exactly one bomb. The flag at (5,7) is the bomb. So the other cells should be safe. For example, (7,7) is unexplored. So revealing (7,7) should be safe. \n\nBut (7,7) is adjacent to (7,6) which is a flag. But according to the rules, flags are supposed to mark bombs, so revealing a flagged cell would be a mistake. But (7,7) is unexplored. \n\nWait, (7,7) is . (unexplored). The cell (6,7) is 1. The adjacent cells to (6,7) are (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). The flag at (5,7) is adjacent. So (6,7) is 1, which is satisfied by the flag at (5,7). Therefore, (7,7) should be safe. \n\nSo revealing (7,7) would be a safe move. \n\nAlternatively, cell (5,9) is another candidate. \n\nBut which of these is the best move? \n\nGiven the conflicts found earlier, perhaps the safest move is to reveal a cell that is definitely safe based on existing numbers. \n\nFor example, cell (5,9) is adjacent to (4,8) which is 1 with a flag at (5,7). So (5,9) should be safe. \n\nAlternatively, cell (9,6) is adjacent to (9,5) which is 1 with a flag at (8,4). So (9,6) should be safe. \n\nBut let's check (9,5) again. The cell (9,5) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (8,4) F, (8,5) 3, (8,6) 1, (9,4) 1, (9,6) ., and others. The flag at (8,4) is adjacent. So the 1 at (9,5) is satisfied by the flag at (8,4). Therefore, (9,6) should be safe. \n\nSo revealing (9,6) would be a safe move. \n\nAlternatively, cell (5,9) is also safe. \n\nBut which one to choose? \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, cell (5,2) is unexplored. The cell (5,1) is 1. The adjacent cells to (5,1) include (5,0), (5,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). The cell (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1. The cell (5,0) is unexplored, (5,2) is unexplored, (6,0) is unexplored, (6,1) is 1, (6,2) is unexplored. \n\nThe 1 at (5,1) requires exactly one bomb in these cells. The cells (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) are all 1s, which are revealed and thus safe. So the bomb must be in (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), or (6,2). \n\nBut without more info, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 6, cell (6,2) is unexplored. The cell (6,3) is 2. The adjacent cells to (6,3) include (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). The flag at (5,4) is adjacent. So one bomb. Therefore, there must be one more bomb in the remaining cells. \n\nIf we can find a cell that must be safe, we can reveal it. \n\nBut this area is still ambiguous. \n\nGiven all this, the safest move seems to be revealing (9,6) or (5,9). \n\nAlternatively, considering the remaining flags (3), perhaps there's a place where a flag can be placed. \n\nLooking at row 3, cells (3,4) and (3,5) are unexplored. The cell (3,6) is 1. The adjacent cells to (3,6) are (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). The 1 at (3,6) requires one bomb. The unexplored cells are (2,5), (3,5). \n\nIf we can determine that one of these is a bomb, we can flag it. \n\nBut how? \n\nThe cell (2,5) is adjacent to (2,4) which is 2. The cell (2,4) has a flag at (3,3) and needs one more bomb. So (2,5) could be that bomb. \n\nIf we place a flag at (2,5), that would satisfy the 2 at (2,4). But we need to check if that doesn't conflict with other numbers. \n\nFor example, the cell (1,5) is 1. If (2,5) is a bomb, then (1,5) would have one bomb adjacent, which is correct. \n\nSo placing a flag at (2,5) would be a valid move. \n\nBut we have to check if that's allowed. The flags remaining are 3. Currently, there are 7 flags, and the total bombs are 10. So placing a flag at (2,5) would use one of the remaining flags. \n\nBut we need to ensure that placing this flag doesn't create a conflict. \n\nIf we place a flag at (2,5), then the cell (2,4) would have two bombs (flag at (3,3) and (2,5)), which matches its number 2. The cell (1,5) would have one bomb (at (2,5)), which matches its number 1. The cell (3,6) would have one bomb (at (3,5) or (2,5)). Wait, (3,6) is adjacent to (2,5). So if (2,5) is a bomb, then (3,6) would have one bomb, which is correct. \n\nBut then the cell (3,5) would need to be safe. Because (3,6) is 1, and (2,5) is a bomb, then (3,5) must be safe. \n\nBut (3,5) is unexplored. So placing a flag at (2,5) would be valid. \n\nBut how do we know that (2,5) is a bomb? It's possible, but without more info, it's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more certain move. \n\nLooking back at the conflict in (8,5), which has four flags adjacent but is a 3. This suggests that one of the flags is incorrect. But according to other cells, all flags are correctly placed. This is a contradiction. \n\nBut since the problem states that the board is in this state, perhaps the user made a mistake in the board setup. However, we have to proceed with the given information. \n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think the safest move is to reveal (9,6) because it's adjacent to (9,5) which is 1 and has a flag in (8,4), so (9,6) should be safe. \n\nAlternatively, revealing (5,9) is also safe. \n\nBut let's check (9,6) again. The cell (9,5) is 1. The adjacent cells are (8,4) F, (8,5) 3, (8,6) 1, (9,4) 1, (9,6) ., and others. The flag at (8,4) is adjacent to (9,5). So the 1 at (9,5) is satisfied by the flag at (8,4). Therefore, (9,6) must be safe. \n\nSo the move would be to reveal (9,6). \n\nAlternatively, the cell (5,9) is adjacent to (4,8) which is 1 with a flag at (5,7). So (5,9) is safe. \n\nEither of these is a valid move. \n\nBut which one to choose? \n\nLooking at the board, (9,6) is in the bottom-right area, which might have fewer interactions. Revealing it could open up more information. \n\nAlternatively, (5,9) is in the middle-right. \n\nBut both are safe. \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9, cell (9,7) is unexplored. The cell (8,7) is unexplored. The cell (8,6) is 1. The adjacent cells to (8,6) are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). The flags at (7,5) and (7,6) are adjacent. So the 1 at (8,6) requires one bomb. But there are two flags adjacent, which is a conflict. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrect. \n\nBut according to previous analysis, (7,5) and (7,6) are needed for other numbers. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll choose to reveal (9,6) as the next move.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell (9,5) is a 1 with an adjacent flag at (8,4), so the unexplored cell (9,6) must be safe to reveal. This follows from the rule that the number 1 indicates exactly one bomb adjacent, which is already accounted for by the flag.\n\nMOVE: 9,6,false", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 F . . 1 _ _ _\n4 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _\n7 . 1 _ 2 F F F _ _ _\n8 . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\n9 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 3, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next move, either placing a flag or revealing a tile. Let's start by analyzing the current state of the board and the game info. \n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with 10 bombs and 3 flags remaining. So there are already some flags placed, and we need to make sure any new flags are correct. Let's check the existing flags first to see if there are any conflicts.\n\nLooking at the board, there's a flag at (3,3). Let's check the numbers around it. The cell at (3,2) is a 1. If there's a flag at (3,3), then that 1 at (3,2) should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The flag at (3,3) is adjacent to (3,2), so that satisfies the 1. So that seems okay. \n\nAnother flag is at (4,4). The cell (4,3) is a 2. Let's see. The 2 at (4,3) has adjacent cells. The flag at (4,4) is one of them. Are there other possible bombs around (4,3)? Let's check. The adjacent cells to (4,3) would include (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). The flag at (4,4) is one, so the 2 requires one more bomb. Let's see if that's possible. The cell (5,3) is unexplored (.), so maybe that's a bomb. But I need to check other numbers to confirm.\n\nAnother flag is at (5,7). Let's check the surrounding numbers. The cell (5,6) is a 1. The flag at (5,7) is adjacent to (5,6), so that 1 should be satisfied. That seems okay. \n\nThe cell (8,5) is a 3. Let's check the flags around it. The cell (8,5) is adjacent to (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). There's a flag at (7,5) and (7,6) and (7,4) is a F? Wait, looking at row 7: the cells (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are all F's. So the 3 at (8,5) has three adjacent flags. That's correct because the number is 3. So that's okay.\n\nNow, let's look for any conflicts. For example, any numbered cell that has more flags around it than the number. Let's check the 1s. The cell at (1,4) is a 1. Are there any flags adjacent to it? The adjacent cells would be (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). None of those are flagged, so that's okay. \n\nAnother 1 is at (2,6). Adjacent cells: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). The cell (3,5) is unexplored (.), but no flags here. So no conflict.\n\nNow, let's look for cells where the number indicates a certain number of bombs, and the existing flags plus possible unexplored cells can help determine where bombs are. \n\nLooking at row 4, column 8 (cell (4,8)) is a 1. The adjacent cells include (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). The cell (5,7) is a flag. So the 1 at (4,8) already has a flag adjacent. That means all other adjacent cells must be safe. So (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,8), (5,9) should be safe. But (3,7) is unexplored (.), so maybe we can reveal that. Wait, but (4,8) is a 1 with a flag at (5,7). So the 1 is satisfied. Therefore, all other adjacent cells can be safely revealed. Let's check if any of those are unexplored. For example, (3,7) is a '.' in row 3, column 7. Let me check the board again. \n\nLooking at row 3: the cells are _ _ 1 F . . 1 _ _ _. So column 7 in row 3 is '_', which is already revealed. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck. The cell (4,8) is in row 4, column 8. The adjacent cells would be (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). \n\nLooking at row 3, column 7: the cell (3,7) is '_', which is already revealed. So that's safe. (3,8) and (3,9) are also '_' in row 3. (4,7) is a 1. (4,9) is '_'. (5,7) is F. (5,8) is 1. (5,9) is '_'. So all adjacent cells to (4,8) are either revealed or flags, except maybe (3,9) and (4,9) and (5,9). Wait, (4,9) is '_', which is revealed. So perhaps there's no unexplored cells adjacent to (4,8). Hmm, maybe that's not the right place to look.\n\nLet's look elsewhere. The cell (5,4) is a F. Let's check the numbers around it. The cell (5,3) is a 1. The flag at (5,4) is adjacent to (5,3). So the 1 at (5,3) should have exactly one bomb. The flag at (5,4) is that bomb. So the other adjacent cells to (5,3) must be safe. The adjacent cells to (5,3) are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). The cell (5,4) is a flag. So the other cells must be safe. Let's check if any of those are unexplored. For example, (5,2) is '_', which is revealed. (6,2) is '_', (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3. So all adjacent cells are revealed. So that's okay.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 3 (cell (6,3)) is a 2. Let's check adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). The cell (5,4) is a flag, so that's one bomb. The 2 requires another bomb. The other cells: (5,2) is '_', (5,3) is 1, (6,2) is '_', (6,4) is 3, (7,2) is '.', (7,3) is '.', (7,4) is F. Wait, (7,4) is a flag. So the 2 at (6,3) has two flags adjacent: (5,4) and (7,4). But the number is 2, so that's correct. So no conflict here.\n\nWait, but (7,4) is a flag. So the 2 at (6,3) has two adjacent flags. That's correct. So that's okay.\n\nNow, let's look for cells where the number is not yet satisfied by existing flags. For example, the cell (4,3) is a 2. The adjacent cells include (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). The flag at (4,4) is one bomb, so there should be one more. Let's check the adjacent cells. (3,3) is a flag, but wait, (3,3) is a flag? Wait, looking at row 3: (3,3) is F. So that's another flag. Wait, the cell (4,3) is a 2. The adjacent flags are (3,3) and (4,4). So that's two flags. But the number is 2, so that's correct. So no problem here.\n\nWait, but (3,3) is a flag. So the cell (4,3) has two adjacent flags. That's correct. So that's okay.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for other cells. Let's check the cell (8,5) which is a 3. The adjacent cells include (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). The flags at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are three flags. So the 3 is satisfied. So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking for cells where the number is not yet met by flags. For example, the cell (6,4) is a 3. Let's check adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The flags here are (5,4) and (7,4), (7,5). Wait, (5,4) is a flag, (7,4) is a flag, and (7,5) is a flag. So that's three flags. The number is 3, so that's correct. \n\nAnother cell to check is (7,7), which is '_'. Wait, no, (7,7) is unexplored. Let me check the board again. Row 7: . 1 _ 2 F F F _ _ _. So (7,7) is '_', which is revealed. Hmm.\n\nLet's look at the cell (5,5) which is a 1. The adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). The cell (5,4) is a flag. So the 1 at (5,5) is satisfied. Therefore, all other adjacent cells must be safe. For example, (4,4) is a flag, but that's already accounted for. Wait, (4,4) is a flag. So the 1 at (5,5) has one adjacent flag. So the other cells should be safe. Let's check if any of them are unexplored. (4,5) is 2, (4,6) is 1, (5,6) is 1, (6,4) is 3, (6,5) is 3, (6,6) is 2. All are revealed. So no action needed here.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 5 (cell (8,5)) is a 3. As checked before, the three flags around it satisfy the number. \n\nNow, let's check the remaining flags. The game info says there are 3 flags remaining. Let's count how many flags are already placed. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 3, column 3: F\nRow 4, column 4: F\nRow 5, column 7: F\nRow 7, columns 4,5,6: F F F\nRow 8, column 4: F\nRow 5, column 4: F (Wait, row 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _). So in row 5, column 4 is F, and column 7 is F. So that's two flags in row 5. Then row 7 has three flags (columns 4,5,6). Row 3 has one, row 4 has one, row 8 has one. Wait, let's count all flags:\n\nRow 3: 1 (column 3)\nRow 4: 1 (column 4)\nRow 5: 2 (columns 4 and 7)\nRow 7: 3 (columns 4,5,6)\nRow 8: 1 (column 4)\nTotal flags: 1+1+2+3+1 = 8. But the game info says flags remaining are 3. Wait, that's a problem. Because the total bombs are 10. If there are 8 flags placed, then flags remaining should be 10 - 8 = 2. But the game info says flags remaining: 3. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me recount the flags:\n\nRow 3: (3,3) F \u2192 1\nRow 4: (4,4) F \u2192 1\nRow 5: (5,4) F and (5,7) F \u2192 2\nRow 7: (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) F \u2192 3\nRow 8: (8,4) F \u2192 1\nTotal: 1+1+2+3+1 = 8. So 8 flags placed. The total bombs are 10, so flags remaining should be 10 - 8 = 2. But the game info says flags remaining: 3. That suggests that there's a mistake either in the count or in the game info. But according to the user-provided data, the flags remaining are 3. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let's check each row again:\n\nRow 0: no flags.\nRow 1: no flags.\nRow 2: no flags.\nRow 3: column 3 is F \u2192 1.\nRow 4: column 4 is F \u2192 1.\nRow 5: columns 4 and 7 are F \u2192 2.\nRow 6: no flags.\nRow 7: columns 4,5,6 are F \u2192 3.\nRow 8: column 4 is F \u2192 1.\nRow 9: no flags.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+3+1 = 8. So 8 flags placed. The user says flags remaining: 3. So 10 bombs total. 10 - 8 = 2 flags remaining. But the user says 3. That's a conflict. So either the user made a mistake, or I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at row 5: the row is \". 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _\". So columns 4 and 7 are F. So two flags here. Row 7: \" . 1 _ 2 F F F _ _ _\". Columns 4,5,6 are F. Three flags. Row 8: \". 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\". Column 4 is F. So one flag. So total flags: 1 (row3) +1 (row4) +2 (row5) +3 (row7) +1 (row8) = 8. So flags remaining should be 10 -8 =2, but the user says 3. That's a problem. Maybe the user's data is incorrect, but I have to proceed with the given info. So according to the game info, flags remaining are 3, so maybe there are 7 flags placed. Wait, 10 bombs -3 remaining =7 placed. So perhaps I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I counted row 5's flags as two, but maybe there's only one. Let me check row 5 again. The row is: \". 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _\". So columns 4 and 7 are F. So two flags. Row 7: three flags. Row 8: one. So 1+1+2+3+1=8. So the user's info is conflicting. But perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the flags remaining count is correct, and the board has 7 flags placed. But according to the board state provided, there are 8 flags. Hmm. This is confusing. But since the user says flags remaining are 3, and bombs are 10, then flags placed should be 7. So perhaps there's a mistake in the board state. But I have to proceed with the given data. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the board. Let me check again. For example, row 5: (5,4) is F, (5,7) is F. So two flags. Row 7: (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are F. Three flags. Row 8: (8,4) is F. So that's 2+3+1=6. Plus row3 and row4: 1 each. Total 8. So the flags remaining should be 10-8=2. But the user says 3. So perhaps there's a mistake. But regardless, I have to proceed with the given info. So according to the user, flags remaining are 3. So maybe there are 7 flags placed. But according to the board, there are 8. So perhaps there's a flag that's incorrectly placed. But I have to work with the given data. \n\nAssuming the user's data is correct, perhaps there's a flag that's not supposed to be there. But according to the rules, each flag must correspond to a bomb. So maybe one of the existing flags is incorrect, leading to a conflict. Let's check for conflicts again.\n\nFor example, the cell (5,4) is a flag. Let's check the numbers around it. The cell (5,3) is a 1. The flag at (5,4) is adjacent to (5,3). So that's correct. The cell (4,3) is a 2. The flag at (4,4) and (3,3) are adjacent to (4,3), which is a 2. So that's correct. The cell (5,5) is a 1. The flag at (5,4) is adjacent to (5,5), so that's correct. \n\nAnother flag is at (5,7). The cell (5,6) is a 1. The flag at (5,7) is adjacent to (5,6), so that's correct. \n\nThe flags at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are adjacent to (8,5) which is a 3. Correct. \n\nThe flag at (8,4) is adjacent to (8,5) which is a 3, but (8,5) has three flags already. Wait, (8,5) is a 3. The adjacent flags are (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). The cell (8,4) is a flag. But (8,4) is adjacent to (8,5). So the 3 at (8,5) has four adjacent flags? Wait, no. Let's check the adjacency. The cell (8,5) is adjacent to (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). The flags at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are three. The flag at (8,4) is adjacent to (8,5). So that's four flags adjacent to (8,5), but the number is 3. That's a conflict! So this is a problem. \n\nAh, here's a conflict. The cell (8,5) is a 3, but it has four adjacent flags: (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), and (8,4). That's four flags, but the number is 3. This is impossible. So one of these flags must be incorrect. \n\nSo this is a critical conflict. According to the rules, if a numbered tile shows a number that is less than the number of adjacent flags, that's a conflict. So the cell (8,5) is a 3, but there are four flags around it. That's a problem. Therefore, one of these flags is wrong. \n\nSo which flag is incorrect? Let's analyze. The cell (8,5) is a 3. The four flags around it are (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), and (8,4). But the number is 3, so exactly three of these must be bombs. So one of these flags is incorrect. \n\nLet's check each of these flags to see if they are necessary. \n\nFirst, the flag at (7,4). Let's look at the cell (7,3), which is a 2. The adjacent cells to (7,3) are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). The cell (7,4) is a flag. The number at (7,3) is 2. So there must be two bombs adjacent. If (7,4) is a bomb, then there needs to be one more. Let's check other adjacent cells. (6,4) is a 3. The cell (6,4) is a 3, which has three bombs around it. The flags at (5,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are adjacent to (6,4). Wait, (6,4) is a 3. Adjacent cells include (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The flags at (5,4), (7,4), (7,5) are three flags. So that's correct. So (6,4) is satisfied. \n\nBack to (7,3) being a 2. The flag at (7,4) is one bomb. So there must be another bomb in the adjacent cells. The other cells are (6,2) is '.', (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3, (7,2) is '.', (8,2) is '.', (8,3) is 2, (8,4) is F. So the flag at (8,4) is another bomb. So (7,3) has two bombs: (7,4) and (8,4). So the 2 at (7,3) is satisfied. Therefore, both (7,4) and (8,4) must be bombs. \n\nBut then, the cell (8,5) has four flags, which is a problem. So if (7,4) and (8,4) are both bombs, then (8,5) has four flags, which is impossible. Therefore, one of these flags must be wrong. \n\nBut according to the cell (7,3), the two bombs are (7,4) and (8,4). So those two must be bombs. Then, the cell (8,5) has three bombs: (7,5), (7,6), and one of (7,4) or (8,4). But according to (7,3), both (7,4) and (8,4) are bombs. So that would make (8,5) have four bombs, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. \n\nThis suggests that one of the flags is incorrectly placed. Let's check the cell (8,4). The cell (8,4) is a flag. Let's look at the numbers around it. The cell (8,3) is a 2. Adjacent cells to (8,3) are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). The flag at (8,4) is one bomb. The number is 2, so there must be another bomb. The other cells: (7,4) is a flag, which is another bomb. So (8,3) has two bombs: (7,4) and (8,4). That's correct. \n\nSo according to (8,3), both (7,4) and (8,4) must be bombs. But then, (8,5) has four flags, which is impossible. Therefore, the only way this can be resolved is if one of the flags at (7,5) or (7,6) is incorrect. \n\nLet's check the cell (7,5). The cell (7,5) is a flag. Let's look at the numbers around it. The cell (6,5) is a 3. Adjacent cells to (6,5) are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). The flags at (5,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are four flags. But the number is 3. So this is a conflict. The cell (6,5) is a 3, but there are four flags around it. That's impossible. Therefore, one of these flags must be incorrect. \n\nSo the cell (6,5) is a 3, but the adjacent flags are (5,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). That's four flags. So this is a conflict. Therefore, one of these flags is wrong. \n\nBut according to previous analysis, (7,4) and (8,4) are required to be bombs. So (7,4) is a bomb. Then, the cell (6,5) has four flags, which is impossible. Therefore, one of the flags (5,4), (7,5), (7,6) must be incorrect. \n\nLet's check the cell (5,4). The cell (5,4) is a flag. The cell (5,3) is a 1. The flag at (5,4) is adjacent to (5,3), so that's correct. The cell (5,5) is a 1, which is adjacent to (5,4). So that's correct. The cell (4,4) is a flag. The cell (4,3) is a 2. The flags at (4,4) and (3,3) are adjacent to (4,3), which is correct. \n\nSo (5,4) seems to be correctly placed. \n\nNow, the cell (7,5) is a flag. Let's check the cell (7,5) for conflicts. The cell (7,5) is adjacent to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). The cell (6,5) is a 3, which we already discussed. The cell (8,5) is a 3. If (7,5) is a bomb, then that's part of the count for (8,5). But (8,5) has four flags, which is a problem. \n\nSo the conflict arises because (7,5) and (7,6) are flags, but they may not be bombs. Let's check the cell (7,6). The cell (7,6) is a flag. The cell (6,6) is a 2. Adjacent cells to (6,6) are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). The flags at (5,7) and (7,6) are two flags. The number is 2, so that's correct. So (7,6) is a valid flag. \n\nSo the problem must be with (7,5). Let's check if (7,5) is a bomb. If (7,5) is not a bomb, then the cell (6,5) would have three flags (5,4), (7,4), (7,6), which is three, matching the number 3. But then, the cell (8,5) would have three flags: (7,4), (7,6), and (8,4). That's three, which matches the number 3. So removing the flag at (7,5) would resolve both conflicts. \n\nBut why is (7,5) flagged? Let's check if there's a number that requires it. The cell (7,5) is flagged. Let's look at adjacent numbers. The cell (6,5) is a 3. The cell (8,5) is a 3. The cell (7,4) is a flag. The cell (7,6) is a flag. \n\nIf (7,5) is not a bomb, then the cell (6,5) would have three bombs: (5,4), (7,4), (7,6). That's three, which matches the number. The cell (8,5) would have three bombs: (7,4), (7,6), (8,4). That's three, which matches. So removing the flag at (7,5) would resolve the conflicts. \n\nBut why was (7,5) flagged in the first place? Let's check the cell (7,5). The cell (7,5) is unexplored, but flagged. But according to the board state, (7,5) is F. So the user placed a flag there. But according to the numbers, it's not required. So this flag is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the flag at (7,5) is wrong and should be removed. \n\nBut according to the rules, we can remove a flag by making a move with flag=true on an already flagged square. So to remove the flag at (7,5), we would send a move to (7,5) with flag=true. \n\nBut wait, the rules say: \"To remove a flag, make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\" So placing a flag on an already flagged square removes it. \n\nSo removing the flag at (7,5) would correct the conflicts in both (6,5) and (8,5). \n\nBut the game info says flags remaining are 3. If we remove a flag, the flags remaining would increase by 1. So after removal, flags remaining would be 4. But according to the game info, there are 10 bombs. So the total flags placed should be 10. Currently, there are 8 flags (assuming the user's info is wrong), but according to the user, flags remaining are 3. So if we remove one flag, flags remaining becomes 4. But the total bombs are 10, so flags placed would be 10 -4 =6. But according to the board, there are 8 flags. So this is confusing. \n\nBut regardless of the flags remaining count, the conflict exists. The cell (6,5) has four flags around it, which is impossible. Therefore, the flag at (7,5) must be removed. \n\nSo the next move should be to remove the flag at (7,5). \n\nBut wait, according to the rules, when you place a flag on an already flagged square, it removes it. So the move would be x=7, y=5, flag=true. \n\nBut why was the flag placed there in the first place? Maybe it was a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's look for safe squares to reveal. \n\nLooking at the cell (9,9) which is '.', but in the last row and column. Let's see if we can find a safe move. \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 9: the cells are . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . \n\nThe cell (9,0) is '.', but adjacent to (8,0) which is '.', and (8,1) which is 1. The cell (8,1) is 1. Adjacent cells to (8,1) are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). The cell (8,1) is a 1. Are there any flags adjacent? (7,0) is '.', (7,1) is 1, (7,2) is '.', (8,0) is '.', (8,2) is '.', (9,0) is '.', (9,1) is 1, (9,2) is '_'. So no flags adjacent. So the 1 at (8,1) must have exactly one bomb in the adjacent cells. The adjacent unexplored cells are (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0). So one of these must be a bomb. But without more info, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, looking at row 5, column 2: it's '_'. The cell (5,2) is '_', which is revealed. \n\nLooking at row 5, column 8: it's 1. The cell (5,8) is 1. Adjacent cells include (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). The cell (5,7) is F. So the 1 at (5,8) is satisfied. Therefore, all other adjacent cells must be safe. (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is 1, (4,9) is '_', (5,9) is '_', (6,7) is 1, (6,8) is 1, (6,9) is '_'. So all are revealed except (4,9), (5,9), (6,9). But (4,9) is '_', which is revealed. (5,9) is '_', and (6,9) is '_'. So no unexplored cells here. \n\nLooking at row 9, column 6: it's '_'. The cell (9,6) is '_', which is revealed. \n\nAnother approach: look for cells that have a number equal to the number of adjacent unexplored cells. For example, if a cell has a number 1 and only one unexplored cell adjacent, then that unexplored cell must be a bomb. \n\nLet's look for such cases. \n\nThe cell (2,5) is '.' (unexplored). Wait, no, looking at row 2: _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _. So (2,5) is '.', unexplored. The cell (2,4) is 2. Let's check adjacent cells to (2,4). The cell (2,4) is 2. Adjacent cells include (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). The cell (1,4) is 1, (1,5) is 1, (2,3) is 1, (2,5) is '.', (3,3) is F, (3,4) is '.', (3,5) is '.', (1,3) is '_'. \n\nSo the cell (2,4) is a 2. The adjacent cells are (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), and (3,3) is F. So the F at (3,3) is adjacent to (2,4). So that's one bomb. The number is 2, so there must be one more bomb in the remaining adjacent cells: (2,5), (3,4), (3,5). \n\nBut (2,5) is unexplored, (3,4) and (3,5) are unexplored. So there are three unexplored cells, and one of them must be a bomb. But without more info, we can't determine which. \n\nAnother cell: (3,5) is '.', and the cell (3,6) is 1. The cell (3,6) is 1. Adjacent cells include (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). The cell (2,6) is 1, (2,7) is '_', (3,5) is '.', (3,7) is '_', (4,5) is 2, (4,6) is 1, (4,7) is 1. So the 1 at (3,6) must have exactly one bomb in the adjacent cells. The unexplored cells are (2,5) and (3,5). So one of these must be a bomb. But again, not enough info. \n\nLooking at cell (6,7) which is 1. Adjacent cells include (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). The cell (5,7) is F. So the 1 at (6,7) is satisfied. Therefore, all other adjacent cells must be safe. (5,6) is 1, (5,8) is 1, (6,6) is 2, (6,8) is 1, (7,6) is F, (7,7) is '_', (7,8) is '_'. So all are revealed except (7,7) and (7,8), which are '_' and '_', already revealed. So no action here. \n\nAnother cell: (8,7) is '_'. The cell (8,7) is revealed. \n\nLooking at row 9, column 9: it's '.', but adjacent to (8,8) which is 1, (8,9) which is 1, (9,8) which is 1. The cell (9,9) is unexplored. The adjacent numbers are all 1s. But without more info, it's hard to tell. \n\nBack to the earlier conflict. The cell (8,5) has four flags around it, which is impossible. The cell (6,5) has four flags around it, which is also impossible. Therefore, the flag at (7,5) must be removed. \n\nSo the correct move is to remove the flag at (7,5). \n\nBut according to the rules, to remove a flag, you make a move with flag=true on that coordinate. So the move would be x=7, y=5, flag=true. \n\nThis would remove the flag, resolving the conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another safe move. For example, the cell (3,4) is unexplored ('.'). Let's check the numbers around it. The cell (3,4) is adjacent to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). The cell (3,3) is F, (4,4) is F. The cell (2,4) is 2. The cell (4,3) is 2. \n\nThe cell (2,4) is 2. The adjacent flags are (3,3) and (4,4). So that's two flags, which matches the number. Therefore, all other adjacent cells must be safe. The cell (2,5) is '.', (3,4) is '.', (3,5) is '.', (2,3) is 1. So the cells (2,5), (3,4), (3,5) must be safe. Therefore, we can reveal (3,4). \n\nYes! This is a safe move. Because the cell (2,4) is a 2 with two adjacent flags (3,3) and (4,4). Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells must be safe. So (3,4) can be safely revealed. \n\nSo the move would be to reveal (3,4). \n\nThis seems like a solid move without any risk. \n\nSo the explanation is that the cell (2,4) is a 2 with two adjacent flags, so the remaining adjacent cells are safe. Therefore, (3,4) can be safely revealed.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell (2,4) is a 2 with two adjacent flags (3,3 and 4,4), so the remaining adjacent cells (including 3,4) are safe to reveal.  \nMOVE: 3,4,false", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 F . . 1 _ _ _\n4 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _\n7 . 1 _ 2 F F F _ _ _\n8 . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\n9 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 5, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next move, either placing a flag or revealing a tile. Let's start by analyzing the current state of the board and the game info. The board is 10x10, there are 3 flags remaining, and 10 bombs in total. So, we need to be careful with flag placements to not exceed the remaining flags or the total bombs.\n\nFirst, I'll check the revealed numbers and existing flags to see if there are any conflicts. Let's go through each cell step by step.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 5 (2,5) is a '.', which is unexplored. But around it, there are numbers. Wait, no, the cell (2,5) is actually a '.' so it's unexplored. Let me check the surrounding cells.\n\nWait, the cell at (2,5) is a '.' but the cell at (2,4) is 2. Let's see the surrounding cells of the 2 at (2,4). The 2 at (2,4) is adjacent to cells around it. Let's check adjacent cells. The cells around (2,4) would be:\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n- (2,3), (2,5)\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nLooking at the current board:\n\nRow 1: columns 3,4,5 are 1,1,1. So (1,3) is 1, (1,4) is 1, (1,5) is 1.\n\nRow 2: (2,3) is 1, (2,4) is 2, (2,5) is '.'.\n\nRow 3: (3,3) is F (flagged), (3,4) is 2, (3,5) is 1.\n\nSo the 2 at (2,4) has adjacent cells. Let's count the flags. The cell (3,3) is flagged. So that's one flag adjacent to (2,4). The number is 2, so there should be exactly two bombs. Since there's already one flag, there must be one more bomb adjacent. Let's check the other adjacent cells. The other adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5). \n\nLooking at (1,3) is 1. Let's check if that 1 has any flags. The adjacent cells to (1,3) would include (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). But (2,3) is 1, (2,4) is 2. The only flag near (1,3) is (3,3), but that's not adjacent. Wait, (1,3) is in row 1, column 3. Its adjacent cells would be:\n\nRow 0: columns 2,3,4\nRow 1: columns 2,4\nRow 2: columns 2,3,4\n\nLooking at the board, (2,3) is 1. So the 1 at (1,3) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Let's check if there's a flag nearby. The only adjacent cell that's flagged is (3,3), but that's not adjacent to (1,3). So (1,3) has no adjacent flags. Therefore, the 1 at (1,3) must have one bomb in its adjacent cells. But since (2,3) is 1, which is adjacent to (1,3), maybe the bomb is at (2,3)'s adjacent cells. Wait, this might be getting complicated. Let's focus back on the 2 at (2,4).\n\nThe 2 at (2,4) has one flag (3,3). So there's one more bomb needed. The possible cells for the remaining bomb are the other adjacent cells. Let's check which of those are unexplored. The cell (2,5) is unexplored (.), (1,5) is 1, (3,5) is 1. Let's see if any of these cells could be the bomb.\n\nWait, the cell (2,5) is unexplored. If that's a bomb, then placing a flag there would satisfy the 2 at (2,4). But we need to check if that's possible. Let's check the numbers around (2,5). The cell (2,5) is adjacent to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). Let's look at those cells:\n\n- (1,4) is 1\n- (1,5) is 1\n- (1,6) is 1\n- (2,4) is 2\n- (2,6) is 1\n- (3,4) is 2\n- (3,5) is 1\n- (3,6) is empty (from row 3, columns 6 is _)\n\nSo the cell (2,5) is adjacent to several 1s and 2s. Let's consider if placing a flag at (2,5) would affect these numbers.\n\nIf (2,5) is a bomb, then the 1s around it (like (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5)) would have their counts adjusted. But since those cells are already revealed, their numbers must already account for existing bombs. For example, (1,5) is 1. The adjacent cells to (1,5) are (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). If (2,5) is a bomb, then (1,5)'s count would be 1, which is correct if there's exactly one bomb in those cells. But we need to check if there are other flags or bombs already accounted for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the remaining bomb for (2,4) is at (1,5). But (1,5) is a 1. Let's check the 1 at (1,5). The adjacent cells to (1,5) include (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). If (2,5) is a bomb, then (1,5) would have that bomb as adjacent. But (1,5) is already 1. So if there's a bomb at (2,5), then (1,5) would have that bomb, but (1,5) is 1. Are there any other bombs adjacent to (1,5)? Let's see. The cell (1,4) is 1, which is adjacent to (1,5). The cell (1,4) is 1. Let's check if there's a bomb adjacent to (1,4). The adjacent cells to (1,4) are (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). If (2,5) is a bomb, then (1,4) would have that bomb as adjacent. But (1,4) is 1. So if (2,5) is a bomb, then (1,4) would have that bomb plus any others. Wait, but (1,4) is 1. So if (2,5) is a bomb, then (1,4) would have that bomb, but (1,4) is 1. Are there any other bombs adjacent to (1,4)? The cell (2,3) is 1. Let's check (2,3). The adjacent cells to (2,3) include (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (3,3) is flagged. So (2,3) is 1, which is correct because there's a flag at (3,3). So (2,3)'s 1 is satisfied by the flag at (3,3). Therefore, (1,4) can't have any other bombs adjacent. So if (2,5) is a bomb, then (1,4) would have that bomb, making (1,4)'s count 1, which is correct. But (1,5) would also have that bomb, making (1,5)'s count 1. So that's possible. But then (2,5) being a bomb would also affect (2,4)'s count, which is 2. Since (2,4) already has a flag at (3,3), adding (2,5) as a bomb would make two bombs adjacent to (2,4), which is correct. So that seems possible.\n\nBut wait, the cell (2,5) is unexplored. If we place a flag there, that would account for the remaining bomb for (2,4). But we need to check if that's allowed. Also, we have 3 flags remaining. Let's check how many flags are already placed. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 3, column 3: F\nRow 4, column 4: F (wait, looking at the board state, row 4 is 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _, so no F here. Let me check again. The board state for row 3 is _ _ 1 F 2 1 1 _ _ _. So row 3, column 3 is F. Then row 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _. So row 5, columns 4 and 7 are F. Row 7: . 1 _ 2 F F F _ _ _. So row 7, columns 4,5,6 are F. Row 8: . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1. So row 8, column 4 is F. Let's count all Fs:\n\nRow 3,3: 1\nRow 5,4: 1\nRow 5,7: 1\nRow 7,4: 1\nRow 7,5: 1\nRow 7,6: 1\nRow 8,4: 1\n\nWait, that's 7 flags. But the game info says flags remaining: 3, and bombs: 10. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the user provided the board state, and the flags remaining are 3. Let me recount the Fs in the board state.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 3: F at (3,3)\nRow 5: F at (5,4) and (5,7)\nRow 7: F at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\nRow 8: F at (8,4)\n\nSo that's 1 (row3) + 2 (row5) + 3 (row7) + 1 (row8) = 7 flags. But the game info says flags remaining: 3. That implies that the total flags placed are 10 - 3 = 7, which matches. Because bombs are 10, so flags placed should be 10 - remaining flags (3) = 7. So that's correct. So there are 7 flags already placed, and 3 remaining. So we can place up to 3 more flags.\n\nBut back to the 2 at (2,4). If we place a flag at (2,5), that would use one of the remaining flags. But we need to check if that's valid. Let's see if there's any other constraints.\n\nLooking at the cell (3,4) which is 2. The adjacent cells to (3,4) are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). The existing flags are (3,3) and (if we place at (2,5)), then (2,5). So (3,4) is 2. If (3,3) is a flag and (2,5) is a flag, then (3,4) would have two flags adjacent, which matches its number. That's good.\n\nBut wait, (3,4) is 2. If there are two flags adjacent, that's correct. So placing a flag at (2,5) would satisfy both (2,4) and (3,4). Let's check if that's possible.\n\nBut we also need to check other numbers. For example, the cell (1,5) is 1. If (2,5) is a bomb, then (1,5) would have that bomb as adjacent. But (1,5) is 1. Are there any other bombs adjacent to (1,5)? Let's see. The adjacent cells to (1,5) are (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). If (2,5) is a bomb, then (1,5) would have that one bomb, which matches its number. So that's okay.\n\nSimilarly, the cell (2,6) is 1. If (2,5) is a bomb, then (2,6) would have that bomb adjacent. Let's check the adjacent cells of (2,6). They are (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). If (2,5) is a bomb, then (2,6) would have that bomb, making its count 1. But (2,6) is already 1. So that's okay.\n\nSo placing a flag at (2,5) seems possible. But we need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with any other numbers. Let's check the cell (3,5) which is 1. The adjacent cells to (3,5) are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). If (2,5) is a bomb, then (3,5) would have that bomb adjacent. But (3,5) is 1. Are there any other bombs adjacent to (3,5)? The cell (3,4) is 2, which has two bombs adjacent. If (3,3) is a flag and (2,5) is a flag, then (3,4) is satisfied. So (3,5) would have one bomb (from (2,5)), which matches its number. So that's okay.\n\nSo placing a flag at (2,5) seems to satisfy all the adjacent numbers. But wait, the cell (2,5) is unexplored. How do we know it's a bomb? We can't be certain unless the numbers force it. Let's see if there's another way to deduce that (2,5) must be a bomb.\n\nThe 2 at (2,4) requires two bombs. One is already at (3,3). The other must be in one of the adjacent cells. The other adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5). Let's see which of these are unexplored. (2,5) is unexplored. The rest are either numbers or flagged. So the only possible cell for the second bomb is (2,5). Therefore, (2,5) must be a bomb. Hence, we can safely place a flag there.\n\nSo that's a possible move: place a flag at (2,5). But we need to check if that's allowed. Since we have 3 flags remaining, placing one here would leave 2. That's okay.\n\nAnother area to check is row 5. Let's look at row 5, column 4 (5,4) which is F. The cell (5,4) is flagged. Let's check the numbers around it. For example, the cell (4,3) is 2. The adjacent cells to (4,3) are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). The flagged cell (5,4) is adjacent. The number at (4,3) is 2, so there should be two bombs. The flagged cell (5,4) is one, so there must be another bomb in the adjacent cells. The other cells around (4,3) are (3,2) which is 1, (3,3) is F, (3,4) is 2, (4,2) is 1, (4,4) is 2, (5,2) is _, (5,3) is 1. So the remaining bomb could be at (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc. But (3,2) is 1, which must have one bomb adjacent. Let's check (3,2). The adjacent cells to (3,2) are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (3,3) is F. So the 1 at (3,2) must have exactly one bomb, which is the F at (3,3). Therefore, no other bombs can be adjacent to (3,2). So the remaining bomb for (4,3) must be elsewhere. The possible cells are (5,2) which is unexplored (since row 5, column 2 is _), (5,3) is 1. The cell (5,3) is 1, which must have one bomb adjacent. The adjacent cells to (5,3) are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (5,4) is F. So the 1 at (5,3) must have exactly one bomb, which is the F at (5,4). Therefore, there can't be any other bombs adjacent to (5,3). So the remaining bomb for (4,3) must be at (5,2). Therefore, (5,2) must be a bomb. But (5,2) is currently unexplored (since row 5, column 2 is _). So we can place a flag there. But wait, we have to check if that's possible. Let's see.\n\nBut (5,2) is in row 5, column 2. Let's check the numbers around it. The cell (5,3) is 1, which we already considered. The cell (4,2) is 1. The adjacent cells to (4,2) are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). (3,3) is F. The 1 at (4,2) must have exactly one bomb. The F at (3,3) is adjacent, so that's the bomb. Therefore, no other bombs can be adjacent to (4,2). So (5,2) cannot be a bomb. Wait, this is a contradiction. Because if (4,3) needs another bomb, but (5,2) can't be a bomb because of (4,2)'s 1, then where is the bomb?\n\nHmm, this suggests that there's a conflict. Let me re-examine this.\n\nThe cell (4,3) is 2. Adjacent cells include (5,4) which is F. So one bomb. The other bomb must be in another cell. The possible cells are (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3). But (3,2) is 1, which has a bomb at (3,3). So (3,2) can't have any other bombs. (3,4) is 2, which has its own bombs. (4,2) is 1, which has a bomb at (3,3). (4,4) is 2, which has bombs elsewhere. (5,3) is 1, which has a bomb at (5,4). So the only possible cell left is (5,2). But (4,2) is 1, which has a bomb at (3,3). If (5,2) is a bomb, then (4,2) would have that bomb as adjacent. But (4,2) is 1, and already has the bomb at (3,3). That would make (4,2) have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts its number 1. Therefore, (5,2) cannot be a bomb. This suggests that there's a conflict, which means that the existing flags might be incorrect. But according to the game info, flags remaining are 3, and bombs are 10. So perhaps there's a mistake in the flag placements. But according to the rules, the flags must be correct. So this implies that there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, maybe the flag at (5,4) is incorrect. Let's check that. The cell (5,4) is flagged. Let's look at the numbers around it. The cell (5,4) is adjacent to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). The cell (4,3) is 2, (4,4) is 2, (5,5) is 1, etc. If (5,4) is a bomb, then the numbers around it should account for it. For example, (4,3) is 2. If (5,4) is a bomb, then (4,3) would have that bomb plus another. But (4,3) is 2, which would require two bombs. The other bomb could be at (3,3), which is flagged. So (4,3) would have bombs at (3,3) and (5,4), which are both flagged. But (3,3) is already a flag. Wait, (3,3) is adjacent to (4,3), yes. So (4,3) has two bombs: (3,3) and (5,4). That's correct. So the flag at (5,4) is valid. Then why is there a conflict with (4,3) needing another bomb?\n\nWait, no. The cell (4,3) is 2. The adjacent cells include (3,3) which is F and (5,4) which is F. So those two flags would account for the two bombs. Therefore, (4,3) is satisfied. So there's no conflict here. Then why did I think there was a conflict earlier? Because I thought (4,3) needed another bomb, but actually, the two flags (3,3) and (5,4) are both adjacent to (4,3), so that's two bombs. So that's correct. Therefore, the flags at (3,3) and (5,4) are correct. Then the cell (4,3) is satisfied. So no conflict there. So my earlier analysis was wrong. Therefore, the remaining bomb for (4,3) is already accounted for by the flags. So no problem here.\n\nSo going back to the cell (2,4). The only possible remaining bomb is at (2,5). Therefore, placing a flag there is correct. That would use one of the remaining flags, leaving 2. Let's proceed with that.\n\nAnother area to check is row 7. The cells (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are flagged. Let's check the numbers around them. For example, the cell (7,3) is 2. The adjacent cells to (7,3) are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (7,4) is F. So the 2 at (7,3) needs two bombs. One is at (7,4). The other could be at (6,4) which is 3. Wait, (6,4) is 3. Let's check the adjacent cells to (6,4). They are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). (5,4) is F, (7,4) is F, (7,5) is F. So the 3 at (6,4) has three flags adjacent. That's correct. So the 3 is satisfied. Therefore, the 2 at (7,3) has one bomb at (7,4) and another at (6,4) (which is a bomb). But (6,4) is a 3, which is a revealed number. Wait, no. (6,4) is a 3, which means there are three bombs adjacent to it. The flags at (5,4), (7,4), and (7,5) are adjacent to (6,4). So three flags, which matches the 3. So that's correct. Therefore, the 2 at (7,3) has bombs at (7,4) and (6,4). But (6,4) is a revealed 3, which is not a bomb. Wait, this is a problem. Because (6,4) is a revealed number 3, which means it's a safe cell. But according to the flags, (6,4) is adjacent to three flags, which would imply that (6,4) is a safe cell with three bombs around it. That's correct. So the 3 at (6,4) is correct. Therefore, the 2 at (7,3) has bombs at (7,4) and (6,4). But (6,4) is a safe cell. That's a contradiction. Wait, no. The cell (6,4) is a revealed 3, which means it's not a bomb. So the bombs adjacent to (7,3) must be (7,4) and another cell. But (7,4) is flagged. So where is the other bomb?\n\nThe adjacent cells to (7,3) are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (7,4) is F. The other cells: (6,2) is _, (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3 (safe), (7,2) is _, (8,2) is _, (8,3) is 2, (8,4) is F. So the other bomb must be in one of the unexplored cells: (6,2), (7,2), (8,2). But how can we determine which one?\n\nThe cell (8,3) is 2. Its adjacent cells are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). (7,4) is F, (8,4) is F. So the 2 at (8,3) needs two bombs. The two flags are at (7,4) and (8,4). So that's correct. Therefore, the 2 at (8,3) is satisfied. So the bombs for (7,3) must be (7,4) and another cell. The only possible cells are (6,2), (7,2), or (8,2). But there's no information to determine which. So this area might require further exploration.\n\nBut since we're looking for the next move, perhaps the safest move is to place the flag at (2,5) as deduced earlier. Alternatively, there might be other obvious moves.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 9 is 1. The cell (8,9) is 1. Let's check its adjacent cells. They are (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9). (9,9) is '.' (unexplored). The cell (8,9) is 1, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent. The only unexplored cell is (9,9). If (9,9) is a bomb, then that's the one. But there are no flags nearby. So if (9,9) is a bomb, then we need to flag it. But how do we know? Alternatively, if there's another bomb in the adjacent cells. Let's check the other cells. (7,8) and (7,9) are unexplored (row 7, columns 8 and 9 are _ _ _). Wait, row 7 ends at column 9? Let me check the board state for row 7:\n\nRow 7: . 1 _ 2 F F F _ _ _\n\nSo columns 0: ., 1:1, 2:_, 3:2, 4:F, 5:F, 6:F, 7:_, 8:_, 9:_. So (7,8) and (7,9) are unexplored. The cell (8,9) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9). All of these except (8,8) and (9,8) are unexplored. (8,8) is 1 (row 8: . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1). So (8,8) is 1. (9,8) is 1 (row 9: . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .). So (9,8) is 1. So the only unexplored cell adjacent to (8,9) is (9,9). Therefore, (9,9) must be the bomb. So we can place a flag there. But we have 3 flags remaining. Placing a flag here would use one. But we need to check if that's correct.\n\nThe cell (8,9) is 1. If (9,9) is a bomb, then that's the only one. But (9,9) is adjacent to (8,8) which is 1. Let's check (8,8). The adjacent cells to (8,8) are (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). (8,9) is 1, (9,8) is 1, (9,9) is unexplored. If (9,9) is a bomb, then (8,8) would have that bomb adjacent. But (8,8) is 1. Are there any other bombs adjacent to (8,8)? The cell (7,7) is unexplored (row 7, column 7 is _). So if (7,7) is a bomb, then (8,8) would have two bombs, which contradicts its number 1. Therefore, (9,9) must be the only bomb adjacent to (8,9), and (7,7) must be safe. Therefore, placing a flag at (9,9) is correct. That's another possible move.\n\nBut we have to prioritize which move to make first. Let's compare the two options: placing a flag at (2,5) or at (9,9). Both seem valid. But which one is more certain?\n\nThe cell (2,5) is required by the 2 at (2,4) and the 2 at (3,4). It's a definite bomb. The cell (9,9) is required by the 1 at (8,9). But we need to check if there's any other possible cell for the bomb. Since all other adjacent cells to (8,9) are explored and have no flags, (9,9) must be the bomb. So both are definite bombs. So either move is valid. But since we have three flags remaining, we can place both. But which one first?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be safely revealed. For example, looking at row 6, column 2 is '_'. Wait, row 6: . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _. So column 2 is '_', which is empty revealed space. Wait, no. The board legend says '_' is empty revealed space. So that cell is already revealed. Maybe looking for unexplored cells (.) that can be safely revealed.\n\nLooking at row 0, all cells are '_' or '.'? The first row (0) is all '_' except maybe some '.'? Let me check the board state again:\n\nRow 0: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nRow 1: _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\nRow 2: _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\nRow 3: _ _ 1 F 2 1 1 _ _ _\nRow 4: 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\nRow 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _\nRow 6: . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _\nRow 7: . 1 _ 2 F F F _ _ _\nRow 8: . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\nRow 9: . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .\n\nSo the unexplored cells (.) are in rows 5-9, various columns. For example, row 5, column 0 is '.', row 6,0 is '.', etc. Let's look for cells that can be safely revealed based on adjacent numbers.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 0 is '.', which is unexplored. Let's check the adjacent cells. The cell (5,0) is adjacent to (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1). (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is 1, (5,1) is 1, (6,0) is '.', (6,1) is 1. The cell (5,0) is adjacent to three 1s. Let's check if any of these 1s require that (5,0) is safe.\n\nTake the cell (4,0) which is 1. Its adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0) is '_', (3,1) is '_', (4,1) is 1, (5,0) is '.', (5,1) is 1. The 1 at (4,0) must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells. The only possible unexplored cell is (5,0). So if (5,0) is a bomb, then (4,0)'s count would be 1. But are there any flags adjacent to (4,0)? No. So the bomb must be at (5,0). But wait, that would make (4,0)'s count 1. But then (5,0) is a bomb, which would mean that (5,1) is adjacent to a bomb. (5,1) is 1. The adjacent cells to (5,1) are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). If (5,0) is a bomb, then (5,1) would have that bomb plus any others. But (5,1) is 1. So if (5,0) is a bomb, then (5,1) would have that bomb and possibly others. But (4,0) is 1, which would have that bomb. So this is conflicting. Because if (5,0) is a bomb, then (4,0) is satisfied, but (5,1) would have that bomb plus any others. Let's check if there are other bombs adjacent to (5,1). The cell (5,2) is '_', which is empty. (4,2) is 1. (4,2) is 1, which has a bomb at (3,3) (flagged). So (4,2) is satisfied. Therefore, (5,1) can't have any other bombs. So if (5,0) is a bomb, then (5,1) would have that bomb, making its count 1. That's okay. So (5,0) could be a bomb. But how do we know?\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,0) is safe. But there's no way to tell for sure based on the current numbers. So this area is uncertain.\n\nAnother area to check is row 6, column 2 which is '_', but that's already revealed. Let's look at row 5, column 2 which is '_'. Wait, row 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _. So column 2 is '_', which is empty. So that's already revealed. Not helpful.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 0 is '.'. Let's check adjacent cells. The cell (6,0) is adjacent to (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). (5,0) is '.', (5,1) is 1, (6,1) is 1, (7,0) is '.', (7,1) is 1. The cell (6,0) is unexplored. The adjacent 1s might give some info. For example, (5,1) is 1. If (6,0) is a bomb, then (5,1) would have that bomb. But (5,1) is 1, so that's possible. But there's no way to confirm.\n\nAnother possible move is to look for cells that can be revealed based on the numbers. For example, the cell (3,5) is 1. Let's check its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4) is 2, (2,5) is '.', (3,4) is 2, (4,4) is 2, (4,5) is 1. If (2,5) is a bomb (as we deduced earlier), then (3,5) would have that bomb, which matches its 1. So the other cells adjacent to (3,5) must be safe. For example, (3,6) is '_', which is safe. (4,6) is 1. So no help there.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8, column 7 is '_'. The cell (8,7) is '_', which is empty. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that have all their bombs accounted for by flags, so the remaining adjacent cells can be safely revealed. For example, the cell (3,5) is 1. If we place a flag at (2,5), then (3,5) would have that bomb, and the other adjacent cells can be revealed. But since (3,5) is already 1, and the flag at (2,5) would account for it, the other cells adjacent to (3,5) are safe. But (3,5) is already revealed, so that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, look at the cell (6,4) which is 3. The adjacent flags are (5,4), (7,4), (7,5). So three flags, which matches the 3. Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells can be safely revealed. The adjacent cells to (6,4) are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The unexplored cells here are (5,3) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (6,3) is 2, (6,5) is 3, (7,3) is 2. All are revealed. So no unexplored cells here.\n\nAnother cell to check is (6,3) which is 2. Adjacent cells are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,4) is F, (7,4) is F. So the 2 at (6,3) has two flags adjacent. Therefore, the remaining cells are safe. The unexplored cells here are (5,2) is '_', (7,2) is '_', (7,3) is 2. Wait, (5,2) is '_', which is empty. (7,2) is '_', which is empty. So no unexplored cells here.\n\nHmm. It seems that the most definite moves are to place flags at (2,5) and (9,9). But since we can only make one move, we need to choose between them. Alternatively, there might be a cell that can be safely revealed.\n\nLooking back at row 5, column 2 is '_', which is empty. But adjacent to it is (5,3) which is 1. The cell (5,3) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (5,4) is F. So the 1 at (5,3) must have exactly one bomb, which is at (5,4). Therefore, all other adjacent cells are safe. So (5,2) is '_', which is already revealed. (6,2) is '_', also revealed. So no help there.\n\nAnother cell to check is (8,7) which is '_'. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, look at row 9, column 6 which is '_'. The cell (9,6) is '_', which is empty. Not helpful.\n\nWait, looking at row 9, column 9 is '.', which is unexplored. If we place a flag there, that's one of the remaining flags. But how do we know it's a bomb? As discussed earlier, the cell (8,9) is 1, and the only unexplored adjacent cell is (9,9). So (9,9) must be the bomb. Therefore, placing a flag there is correct.\n\nSo between (2,5) and (9,9), both are valid. But which one to choose first? Let's count how many bombs each flag would account for. Placing a flag at (2,5) would satisfy the 2 at (2,4) and the 2 at (3,4). Placing a flag at (9,9) would satisfy the 1 at (8,9). Both are valid. Since we have three flags remaining, either is acceptable. But perhaps (2,5) is more critical because it's part of a cluster of numbers that require it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that can be revealed safely. For example, the cell (6,2) is '_', which is empty. Not helpful. Or the cell (5,0) is '.' and might be a bomb, but we can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, look at row 4, column 9 is '_'. The cell (4,9) is '_', which is empty. Not helpful.\n\nAnother possible safe reveal is in row 5, column 8. The cell (5,8) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). (5,7) is F. So the 1 at (5,8) must have exactly one bomb, which is at (5,7). Therefore, the other adjacent cells are safe. The unexplored cells here are (4,9) is '_', (5,9) is '_', (6,7) is 1, (6,8) is 1, (6,9) is '_'. So (5,9) is unexplored. Since (5,8) is 1 and the bomb is at (5,7), (5,9) must be safe. So we can reveal (5,9). But (5,9) is '_' in the board state. Wait, row 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _. So column 9 is '_', which is empty. So it's already revealed. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. It seems that the most certain moves are to place flags at (2,5) and (9,9). Let's choose one of them. Since (2,5) is part of a cluster that requires it, and placing a flag there would help in revealing more cells around it, perhaps that's the better move.\n\nSo the explanation would be: The number 2 at (2,4) requires exactly two adjacent bombs. One is already flagged at (3,3), so the remaining bomb must be at (2,5). Placing a flag there satisfies the number and uses one of the remaining flags.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The number 2 at (2,4) requires exactly two adjacent bombs. One bomb is already flagged at (3,3), so the remaining bomb must be at the unexplored cell (2,5). Placing a flag here satisfies the number and uses one of the remaining flags.\n\nMOVE: 2,5,true", "flags_remaining": 3, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 2 . 1 _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 F 2 1 1 _ _ _\n4 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _\n7 . 1 _ 2 F F F _ _ _\n8 . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\n9 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 9, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this Minesweeper board. The goal is to figure out the next move, either placing a flag or revealing a tile, without hitting a bomb. The board is 10x10, and there are 2 flags remaining with 10 bombs total. Hmm, so some flags are already placed, but there are still 2 left to place. Let me start by analyzing the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the revealed numbers to see if any have the correct number of adjacent flags. For example, a '1' with a flag next to it should have no other bombs nearby. Let's check each number.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 5 is an F (flagged). The cell at (2,4) is a 2. Wait, the cell (2,4) is a 2, and there's a flag at (2,5). Let's check adjacent cells. The 2 at (2,4) has adjacent cells including (2,5) which is flagged. So that's one bomb accounted for. The 2 needs two bombs. So there must be another bomb adjacent to (2,4). Let's see the adjacent cells. The cells around (2,4) are:\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n(2,3), (2,5)\n(3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nWait, (2,4) is row 2, column 4. So adjacent cells would be:\n\nRow 1: columns 3,4,5\nRow 2: columns 3 and 5\nRow 3: columns 3,4,5\n\nLooking at those cells. The cell (3,3) is an F. So that's another flag. Wait, (3,3) is F. So the 2 at (2,4) has two adjacent flags: (2,5) and (3,3). But the number is 2, so that's exactly two bombs. So that's correct. No problem here.\n\nNext, looking at row 3, column 3 is F. The cell (3,4) is a 2. Let's check adjacent cells. The 2 at (3,4) has adjacent cells. Let's see:\n\nAdjacent cells would be:\n\nRow 2: columns 3,4,5\nRow 3: columns 3 and 5\nRow 4: columns 3,4,5\n\nLooking at those. The F at (3,3) is adjacent. Also, (2,4) is a 2, which is already accounted for. Are there any other flags? The cell (4,4) is a 2. Wait, (3,4) is a 2. Let's check how many flags are adjacent. The F at (3,3) is one. Are there any others? The cell (2,5) is F, but that's adjacent to (2,4), not (3,4). Wait, (3,4) is adjacent to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) (row 2), (3,3), (3,5) (same row), and (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) (row 4). So the F at (3,3) is adjacent. Are there any other flags? Let's check (4,5) which is a 1. No, (4,5) is 1. So the 2 at (3,4) has only one adjacent flag (3,3). Therefore, there must be another bomb adjacent to (3,4). Let's check the adjacent cells. The cells around (3,4) that are unexplored or could be bombs. Let's see:\n\nRow 2, column 5 is F. So that's already a bomb. But (3,4) is adjacent to (2,4) (which is a 2), (2,5) (F), (3,3) (F), (3,5) (1), (4,3) (2), (4,4) (2), (4,5) (1). Wait, but (3,4) is a 2. So the adjacent cells must have two bombs. We already have two flags: (3,3) and (2,5) is not adjacent to (3,4). Wait, (3,4) is adjacent to (2,5)? Let me check again. The coordinates for (3,4) are row 3, column 4. Adjacent cells would be row 2 (row 3-1=2), columns 3,4,5. So (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). Then same row: (3,3) and (3,5). Then row 4: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (2,5) is adjacent to (3,4). So (2,5) is F, which is adjacent. So (3,4) has two adjacent flags: (3,3) and (2,5). Wait, but (2,5) is F. So that's two bombs. Then the 2 at (3,4) is satisfied. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but (3,4) is a 2. The adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). The F's are (3,3) and (2,5). So two flags. So that's correct. So no problem here.\n\nMoving on. Let's check row 5. There's a cell at (5,4) which is F. The cell (5,7) is also F. So those are two flags. The game info says flags remaining: 2. Wait, but the board shows F's at (2,5), (3,3), (5,4), (5,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,4), (8,5). Wait, let me count the F's on the board.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 2: (2,5) F\nRow 3: (3,3) F\nRow 5: (5,4) F, (5,7) F\nRow 7: (7,5) F, (7,6) F, (7,7) F\nRow 8: (8,4) F, (8,5) F\n\nWait, that's 1 (row2) +1 (row3) +2 (row5) +3 (row7) +2 (row8) = total 9 flags. But the game info says flags remaining: 2. Wait, that's conflicting. Because if there are 10 bombs, and 9 flags placed, then flags remaining should be 10 - 9 = 1. But the game says flags remaining: 2. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let's count again:\n\nRow 2: column 5 is F \u2192 1\nRow 3: column 3 is F \u2192 1 (total 2)\nRow 5: columns 4 and 7 \u2192 2 (total 4)\nRow 7: columns 5,6,7 \u2192 3 (total 7)\nRow 8: columns 4 and 5 \u2192 2 (total 9)\nSo total 9 flags placed. But the game info says flags remaining: 2. So total flags possible would be 9 + 2 = 11. But the bombs are 10. That's a problem. Unless there's a mistake in the count. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 2: F at (2,5)\nRow 3: F at (3,3)\nRow 5: F at (5,4) and (5,7)\nRow 7: F at (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\nRow 8: F at (8,4) and (8,5)\n\nSo that's 1 +1 +2 +3 +2 = 9 flags. But the game says flags remaining: 2. So total flags placed is 9, and remaining is 2. So total flags possible is 11. But the bombs are 10. That's impossible. So there's a mistake here. Either the user input is wrong, or I'm miscounting. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the board state. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the board state as provided:\n\nRow 2: ... F ...\nRow 3: ... F ...\nRow 5: ... F ... F ...\nRow 7: ... F F F ...\nRow 8: ... F F ...\n\nYes, that's 9 flags. But the game info says bombs:10, flags remaining:2. So 9 flags placed, 2 left. That would imply 11 flags total, but there are only 10 bombs. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement. But since this is a hypothetical scenario, perhaps the user intended that some of the flags are incorrect. Because if there are 10 bombs, but 9 flags placed, and 2 remaining, that's 11 flags possible, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be at least one incorrect flag. So the player must have placed some flags that are not actual bombs, leading to the discrepancy. Therefore, part of the analysis should involve identifying which flags are incorrectly placed.\n\nThis is a critical point. Since the number of flags placed (9) plus remaining (2) equals 11, which exceeds the total bombs (10), there must be at least one flag that's incorrectly placed. Therefore, the player has made a mistake in flagging, and we need to find where.\n\nSo the first step is to check existing flags against the numbers to see if any are conflicting. Let's check each flag.\n\nStarting with row 2, column 5 (F). Let's look at adjacent numbers. The cell (2,4) is a 2. The cell (2,5) is F, so adjacent to (2,4). The 2 at (2,4) has two bombs. The adjacent flags are (2,5) and (3,3). Wait, (3,3) is F. So (2,4) is a 2 with two adjacent flags. That's correct. So those two flags are correct.\n\nNext, row 3, column 3 (F). The cell (3,4) is a 2. The adjacent flags are (3,3) and (2,5). So that's two flags, which matches the 2. So that's okay.\n\nRow 5, column 4 (F). Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (5,4) is F. Adjacent cells would be (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Let's see:\n\n(4,3) is 2, (4,4) is 2, (4,5) is 1, (5,3) is 1, (5,5) is 1, (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 3, (6,5) is 3.\n\nSo the F at (5,4) is adjacent to (4,3) (2), (4,4) (2), (5,3) (1), (5,5) (1), (6,3) (2), (6,4) (3), (6,5) (3). Let's check if any of these numbers are already satisfied. For example, the 1 at (5,3). The F at (5,4) is adjacent to (5,3). So the 1 at (5,3) would have that F as the only bomb. Let's check adjacent cells to (5,3). The cell (5,3) is 1. Adjacent cells are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). The F at (5,4) is adjacent. Are there any other flags? (4,3) is 2. Let's see if there are other flags adjacent to (5,3). The cell (5,4) is F. So the 1 at (5,3) is satisfied by that F. So that's okay.\n\nSimilarly, the 1 at (5,5) is adjacent to (5,4) F, so that's the only bomb. So that's okay.\n\nThe 3 at (6,4) (row 6, column 4) is adjacent to (5,4) F. Let's check how many bombs are around (6,4). The cell (6,4) is 3. Adjacent cells include (5,3) 1, (5,4) F, (5,5) 1, (6,3) 2, (6,5) 3, (7,3) _, (7,4) _, (7,5) F. Wait, (7,5) is F. So (6,4) is adjacent to two flags: (5,4) and (7,5). But the number is 3. So there should be three bombs. So there's two flags, so one more bomb needed. But the cell (6,4) is 3. So that's possible. The other adjacent cells are (5,3) (1), (5,5) (1), (6,3) (2), (6,5) (3), (7,3) (unexplored), (7,4) (unexplored), (7,5) (F). So the unexplored cells (7,3) and (7,4) could have bombs. But the 3 at (6,4) requires three bombs. So with two flags already adjacent, there must be one more bomb in the remaining adjacent cells. So that's possible. So no conflict here.\n\nNext, row 5, column 7 (F). Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (5,7) is F. Adjacent cells include (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). Let's see:\n\n(4,6) is 1, (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is 1, (5,6) is 1, (5,8) is F (no, (5,8) is 1?), wait looking at row 5:\n\nRow 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _\n\nSo (5,7) is F. The adjacent cells to (5,7) are:\n\nRow 4: columns 6,7,8 \u2192 (4,6) is 1, (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is 1.\n\nRow 5: columns 6 and 8 \u2192 (5,6) is 1, (5,8) is 1.\n\nRow 6: columns 6,7,8 \u2192 (6,6) is 2, (6,7) is 1, (6,8) is 1.\n\nSo the F at (5,7) is adjacent to (4,6) 1, (4,7) 1, (5,6) 1, (5,8) 1, (6,6) 2, (6,7) 1, (6,8) 1. Let's check if any of these numbers are conflicting. For example, (4,7) is 1. The F at (5,7) is adjacent to (4,7). So the 1 at (4,7) should have exactly one bomb adjacent. The F at (5,7) is one. Are there any other flags adjacent to (4,7)? Let's check adjacent cells to (4,7):\n\n(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). The F at (5,7) is adjacent. Are there any other flags? (5,8) is 1, so no. So the 1 at (4,7) is satisfied by (5,7) F. That's okay.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is 1. Adjacent cells include (5,7) F. So that's the only bomb. So okay.\n\nThe 2 at (6,6) (row 6, column 6) is adjacent to (5,7) F. Let's check how many bombs are around (6,6). The cell (6,6) is 2. Adjacent cells include (5,5) 1, (5,6) 1, (5,7) F, (6,5) 3, (6,7) 1, (7,5) F, (7,6) F, (7,7) F. Wait, (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) are F. So (6,6) is adjacent to (5,7) F, (7,5) F, (7,6) F, (7,7) F. Wait, no. (6,6) is row 6, column 6. Adjacent cells would be:\n\nRow 5: columns 5,6,7 \u2192 (5,5) 1, (5,6) 1, (5,7) F.\n\nRow 6: columns 5 and 7 \u2192 (6,5) 3, (6,7) 1.\n\nRow 7: columns 5,6,7 \u2192 (7,5) F, (7,6) F, (7,7) F.\n\nSo the adjacent flags are (5,7) F, (7,5) F, (7,6) F, (7,7) F. That's four flags. But the cell (6,6) is a 2. That's a conflict. Because the number 2 can't have four bombs adjacent. Therefore, this is a problem. So the flags at (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) are adjacent to (6,6) which is a 2. But the 2 can't have four bombs. Therefore, some of these flags must be incorrect. This is a critical conflict.\n\nSo the cell (6,6) is 2, but it has four adjacent flags. That's impossible. Therefore, at least three of those flags are wrong. But since the total bombs are 10, and we have 9 flags placed, but two remaining, this suggests that some flags are incorrect. The conflict here is that (6,6) is a 2 with four adjacent flags. So this is impossible. Therefore, three of those flags must be incorrect. But which ones?\n\nLooking at the adjacent flags to (6,6): (5,7) F, (7,5) F, (7,6) F, (7,7) F. So four flags. The cell (6,6) is 2, so only two of these can be correct. Therefore, two of these flags are correct, and two are incorrect. But how to determine which?\n\nLet's check other cells that might be affected by these flags. For example, the cell (7,5) F. Let's look at adjacent numbers. The cell (7,5) is F. Adjacent cells include (6,4) 3, (6,5) 3, (6,6) 2, (7,4) _, (7,6) F, (8,4) F, (8,5) F, (8,6) 3. The cell (6,5) is 3. Let's check how many bombs are adjacent to (6,5). The cell (6,5) is 3. Adjacent cells include (5,4) F, (5,5) 1, (5,6) 1, (6,4) 3, (6,6) 2, (7,4) _, (7,5) F, (7,6) F. So the flags here are (5,4) F, (7,5) F, (7,6) F. So three flags. The number is 3, so that's correct. So (6,5) is okay. But (6,6) is a problem.\n\nAnother cell to check is (7,6) F. Adjacent cells include (6,5) 3, (6,6) 2, (6,7) 1, (7,5) F, (7,7) F, (8,5) F, (8,6) 3, (8,7) 1. The cell (6,7) is 1. The F at (7,6) is adjacent to (6,7). So the 1 at (6,7) should have exactly one bomb. The F at (7,6) is adjacent. Are there any other flags? (7,7) F is adjacent to (6,7) as well. Wait, (6,7) is 1. Adjacent cells include (5,6) 1, (5,7) F, (5,8) 1, (6,6) 2, (6,8) 1, (7,6) F, (7,7) F, (7,8) _. So the flags at (5,7) F, (7,6) F, (7,7) F. But (6,7) is 1. So three flags adjacent to a 1. That's impossible. Therefore, this is a conflict. The cell (6,7) is 1 but has three adjacent flags, which is impossible. Therefore, at least two of those flags are incorrect.\n\nSo this indicates that the flags at (5,7), (7,6), (7,7) are conflicting with the 1 at (6,7). Therefore, those flags must be incorrect. But how to resolve this?\n\nLet's recap. The cell (6,7) is 1, but adjacent to three flags: (5,7), (7,6), (7,7). That's impossible. Therefore, at least two of these flags are wrong. But which ones?\n\nSimilarly, the cell (6,6) is 2 with four adjacent flags. So two of them must be wrong. Let's try to find which flags are causing the most conflicts.\n\nLooking at the flags in row 7: (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) are all F. These are adjacent to (6,6) 2 and (6,7) 1, which are conflicting. So these three flags are likely problematic.\n\nAdditionally, the cell (8,5) is F. Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (8,5) is F. Adjacent cells include (7,4) _, (7,5) F, (7,6) F, (8,4) F, (8,6) 3, (9,4) 1, (9,5) 1, (9,6) _. The cell (8,6) is 3. Let's check adjacent bombs. Adjacent to (8,6) are (7,5) F, (7,6) F, (7,7) F, (8,5) F, (8,7) _, (9,5) 1, (9,6) _, (9,7) _. The 3 at (8,6) has four adjacent flags. That's impossible. So the cell (8,6) is 3, but adjacent to four flags. Therefore, this is another conflict. So the flags at (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5) are adjacent to (8,6) 3. So four flags, but the number is 3. So one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern. The flags in row 7 (columns 5,6,7) and row 8 (columns 4,5) are causing multiple conflicts. Let's consider that some of these flags are incorrect.\n\nGiven that the total bombs are 10, and we have 9 flags placed (but 2 remaining), which sums to 11, which is more than 10, there must be at least one incorrect flag. But likely more.\n\nLet's start with the cell (6,7) which is 1 and has three adjacent flags. So two of those flags must be wrong. Let's look at the flags (5,7), (7,6), (7,7). If we remove two of these, but which ones?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the flag at (5,7) is correct, and the flags at (7,6) and (7,7) are incorrect. Let's see. If (5,7) is correct, then the 1 at (6,7) would have that as the only bomb. But then the flags at (7,6) and (7,7) would be incorrect. But then, what about the cell (6,6) which is 2. If we remove (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), then the adjacent flags to (6,6) would be (5,7) F. But (6,6) is 2, so there must be two bombs. So another bomb would need to be in the remaining adjacent cells. But which ones?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the flags in row 7 are all incorrect. Let's consider removing the three flags at (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). That would reduce the total flags by 3, making the flags remaining 2 +3 =5. But the bombs are 10, so we need to place 10 flags. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flags at (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) are all incorrect. Let's check if that's possible. If those three flags are removed, then the cell (6,6) 2 would have only the flag at (5,7) adjacent. So the 2 would need one more bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent unexplored cells would be (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), which are now unflagged. So if those are bombs, then (6,6) would have two bombs (5,7) and one of those. But (6,6) is 2. So maybe two of those three cells are bombs. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that can be safely revealed. For example, the unexplored cells (marked with .) are in rows 4-9, columns 0-9. Let's look for unexplored cells adjacent to numbers that have all their bombs accounted for.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 9 is unexplored (.). Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (4,9) is . (unexplored). Adjacent cells are (3,8), (3,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9). The cell (4,8) is 1, (5,8) is 1, (5,9) is . So the cell (4,9) is adjacent to two 1s. Let's check if those 1s have their bombs accounted for.\n\nThe cell (4,8) is 1. Adjacent cells include (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7) F, (5,8), (5,9). The F at (5,7) is adjacent to (4,8). So the 1 at (4,8) is satisfied by the F at (5,7). Therefore, (4,9) is safe to reveal. Because the 1 at (4,8) already has its bomb at (5,7), so (4,9) can't be a bomb. Similarly, the cell (5,8) is 1. Adjacent cells include (4,7) 1, (4,8) 1, (4,9) ., (5,7) F, (5,9) ., (6,7) 1, (6,8) 1, (6,9) _. The F at (5,7) is adjacent to (5,8). So the 1 at (5,8) is satisfied by that F. Therefore, (5,9) is also safe. But (4,9) is adjacent to (4,8) 1 and (5,8) 1, both of which are satisfied by the F at (5,7). Therefore, (4,9) is safe to reveal.\n\nSo the move could be to reveal (4,9). Let's check if that's possible. The cell (4,9) is currently unexplored (.). Revealing it would be safe. But wait, the cell (4,9) is in row 4, column 9. Let me check the board state again:\n\nRow 4: 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n\nSo the last cell in row 4 is column 9, which is _. Wait, no. The board state for row 4 is:\n\n4 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n\nSo the last cell (column 9) is _, which is an empty revealed space. Wait, no. Wait, the board state for row 4 is:\n\n4 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n\nSo columns 0-8 are 1,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,1, and column 9 is _. But _ is an empty revealed space. So (4,9) is already revealed as empty. Wait, no. The underscore _ represents an empty revealed space. So (4,9) is already revealed. Then why is it listed as _? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the board state.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's board state:\n\nRow 4: 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n\nSo columns 0-8 are 1,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,1, and column 9 is _. So (4,9) is _, which is empty revealed. So it's already revealed. So that's not unexplored. The unexplored cells are marked with . (dot). So looking for . in the board.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 0 is . (unexplored). Also, row 6,7,8,9 have some . cells.\n\nFor example, row 5: . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _\n\nSo (5,0) is ., (5,2) is _, (5,9) is _.\n\nRow 6: . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _\n\nSo (6,0) is ., (6,2) is _, (6,9) is _.\n\nRow 7: . 1 _ 2 F F F _ _ _\n\nSo (7,0) is ., (7,2) is _, (7,7) is F, (7,8) is _, (7,9) is _.\n\nRow 8: . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\n\nSo (8,0) is ., (8,2) is _, (8,7) is _, (8,9) is 1.\n\nRow 9: . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .\n\nSo (9,0) is ., (9,2) is _, (9,6) is _, (9,7) is _, (9,9) is .\n\nSo the unexplored cells (.) are at:\n\n(5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,9).\n\nAlso, some cells are _ (revealed empty) or numbers. The other unexplored cells are in rows 5-9, columns 0, 2, 7, 8, 9, etc.\n\nLooking for cells that can be safely revealed. Let's check the cells adjacent to numbers where all bombs are already flagged.\n\nFor example, look at row 8, column 7 is _. But it's already revealed. Let's check row 8, column 7: it's _, so empty. Not helpful.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 2 is _. Also revealed. Hmm.\n\nLet's check the cell (5,2) which is _ (revealed empty). Not helpful.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 0 is unexplored (.). Let's check adjacent numbers. The cell (5,0) is . Adjacent cells are (4,0) 1, (4,1) 1, (5,1) 1, (6,0) ., (6,1) 1. The cell (4,0) is 1. Let's check if that 1 has its bomb accounted for. The 1 at (4,0) is adjacent to (3,0) . (unexplored?), (3,1) . (unexplored?), (4,1) 1, (5,0) ., (5,1) 1. Wait, the cell (4,0) is 1. Adjacent cells include (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). The cell (4,1) is 1, (5,1) is 1. Are there any flags adjacent to (4,0)? No. So the 1 at (4,0) requires one bomb in its adjacent cells. The adjacent unexplored cells are (3,0), (3,1), (5,0). So one of these must be a bomb. But since we don't have any flags here, we can't determine which. So (5,0) could be a bomb, but we can't be sure. Therefore, revealing (5,0) is risky.\n\nAnother cell to check is (6,2) which is _ (revealed empty). Not helpful.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 2 is _. Also revealed.\n\nLet's check row 9, column 9 is . (unexplored). Adjacent cells are (8,8) 1, (8,9) 1, (9,8) 1. The cell (9,9) is adjacent to three 1s. Let's check if those 1s have their bombs accounted for. For example, (8,9) is 1. Adjacent cells include (7,8) _, (7,9) _, (8,8) 1, (9,8) 1, (9,9) .. So the 1 at (8,9) needs one bomb. The unexplored cells are (7,8), (7,9), (9,9). If any of these is a bomb, but without flags, we can't tell. So revealing (9,9) is risky.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are guaranteed safe based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 7 is _ (revealed empty). Not helpful.\n\nLet's check the cell (6,2) which is _ (empty). Adjacent cells may have numbers. Wait, (6,2) is _, so already revealed. Not helpful.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 2 is _ (empty). Adjacent cells include (4,1) 1, (4,2) 1, (4,3) 2, (5,1) 1, (5,3) 1, (6,1) 1, (6,2) _, (6,3) 2. The cell (5,2) is empty, so no help.\n\nLet's look at the cell (8,7) which is _ (empty). Adjacent cells include (7,6) F, (7,7) F, (7,8) _, (8,6) 3, (8,8) 1, (9,6) _, (9,7) _, (9,8) 1. The cell (8,7) is empty, so no help.\n\nAnother idea: look for cells that are adjacent to numbers where the number of remaining hidden cells equals the number of remaining bombs needed. For example, if a cell with number 1 has one unexplored cell adjacent and no flags, then that unexplored cell must be a bomb.\n\nBut given the complexity of the current board, perhaps the best move is to find a cell that is definitely safe based on existing numbers and flags.\n\nLooking back at the conflict in cell (6,6) being 2 with four adjacent flags. This is impossible, so some of those flags must be incorrect. Let's consider that the flags at (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) are incorrect. If we remove those three flags, then the cell (6,6) would have only the flag at (5,7) adjacent. So the 2 at (6,6) would need one more bomb in its adjacent cells. The remaining adjacent cells are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), which are unexplored. So one of those must be a bomb. But since we can't know which, we can't safely reveal any of them yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag at (5,7) is incorrect. If we remove that flag, then the cell (6,6) would have three adjacent flags (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), which is still more than 2. So that's not helpful.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let's look for another approach.\n\nThe flags remaining are 2, but according to the board, there are 9 flags placed. Since the total bombs are 10, we need to place one more flag. But the flags remaining are 2, which suggests that one of the existing flags is incorrect. So perhaps we should remove a flag that's conflicting and place a correct one.\n\nBut how to determine which flag to remove.\n\nLooking back at the cell (6,7) which is 1 with three adjacent flags. This is impossible, so at least two of those flags are wrong. The flags are (5,7), (7,6), (7,7). Let's consider that (7,6) and (7,7) are incorrect. If we remove those two flags, then the cell (6,7) would have only (5,7) as a flag, which satisfies the 1. Then, the cell (6,6) would have flags at (5,7) and (7,5). But (6,6) is 2, so that's correct. But then, the cell (7,5) is still a flag. Let's check if that's valid.\n\nThe cell (7,5) is F. Adjacent cells include (6,4) 3, (6,5) 3, (6,6) 2, (7,4) _, (7,6) (now removed), (8,4) F, (8,5) F, (8,6) 3. The cell (6,5) is 3. Adjacent flags would be (5,4) F, (7,5) F, (8,5) F. That's three flags, but the number is 3. So that's correct. So if (7,5) is a correct flag, then the 3 at (6,5) is satisfied. But then, the cell (8,6) is 3. Adjacent flags would be (7,5) F, (8,5) F, and possibly others. Let's check:\n\nCell (8,6) is 3. Adjacent cells include (7,5) F, (7,6) (now removed), (7,7) (removed), (8,5) F, (8,7) _, (9,5) 1, (9,6) _, (9,7) _. So flags at (7,5) and (8,5). That's two flags. The number is 3, so one more bomb is needed. The unexplored cells are (8,7), (9,6), (9,7). So one of those must be a bomb. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flags at (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) are all incorrect. Removing them would leave the cell (6,6) with only (5,7) as a flag. Then, the 2 at (6,6) would need one more bomb in the adjacent cells (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). So one of those must be a bomb. But without flags, we can't know which. So revealing any of those would be risky.\n\nBut given that the flags remaining are 2, and we have to place them correctly, perhaps the best move is to find a cell that can be safely revealed based on existing numbers.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 3 is 2. The cell (7,3) is 2. Adjacent cells include (6,2) _, (6,3) 2, (6,4) 3, (7,2) _, (7,4) _, (8,2) _, (8,3) 2, (8,4) F. The cell (7,3) is 2. The adjacent flags are (8,4) F. So one flag. Therefore, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (7,3). The unexplored cells are (6,2), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2). Let's check if any of these can be determined.\n\nThe cell (6,3) is 2. Adjacent cells include (5,2) _, (5,3) 1, (5,4) F, (6,2) _, (6,4) 3, (7,2) _, (7,3) 2, (7,4) _. The 2 at (6,3) has one adjacent flag at (5,4) F. So needs one more bomb. The unexplored cells are (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (7,4). But without more info, can't determine.\n\nAnother cell to check: row 8, column 3 is 2. The cell (8,3) is 2. Adjacent cells include (7,2) _, (7,3) 2, (7,4) _, (8,2) _, (8,4) F, (9,2) _, (9,3) 1, (9,4) 1. The adjacent flag is (8,4) F. So one bomb accounted for. Needs one more. Unexplored cells are (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (9,2). No help.\n\nLet's look at row 5, column 2 is _ (empty). Adjacent cells include (4,1) 1, (4,2) 1, (4,3) 2, (5,1) 1, (5,3) 1, (6,1) 1, (6,2) _, (6,3) 2. The cell (5,2) is empty, so no help.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are part of a pattern. For example, in row 5, column 0 is unexplored. The cells to the right of it are 1, _, 1, F, etc. But without adjacent numbers, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, look at row 9, column 0 is unexplored. Adjacent cells are (8,0) ., (8,1) 1, (9,1) 1. The cell (9,0) is . Adjacent to (8,0) which is unexplored, (8,1) 1, (9,1) 1. The 1 at (8,1) is adjacent to (7,0) ., (7,1) 1, (7,2) _, (8,0) ., (8,1) 1, (9,0) ., (9,1) 1, (9,2) _. The 1 at (8,1) needs one bomb. The unexplored cells are (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,2). So one of these must be a bomb. But we can't determine which.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Let's try to find a cell that is definitely safe based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 9 is _ (empty). Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's check the cell (9,6) which is _ (empty). Adjacent cells include (8,5) F, (8,6) 3, (8,7) _, (9,5) 1, (9,7) _, (9,8) 1. The cell (9,6) is unexplored. The 3 at (8,6) has adjacent flags (7,5) F, (8,5) F, and possibly others. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: look for cells that are adjacent to numbers where all bombs are already flagged. For example, the cell (5,3) is 1. Adjacent cells include (5,4) F. So the 1 at (5,3) is satisfied by the F at (5,4). Therefore, any other adjacent cells to (5,3) must be safe. The adjacent cells to (5,3) are (4,2) 1, (4,3) 2, (4,4) 2, (5,2) _, (5,4) F, (6,2) _, (6,3) 2, (6,4) 3. The unexplored cells here are (5,2) and (6,2). Since the 1 at (5,3) is already satisfied, these cells should be safe to reveal. So (5,2) is _ (already revealed), but (6,2) is _ (also revealed). Wait, no. The cell (5,2) is _ (revealed empty), and (6,2) is _ (revealed empty). So no help.\n\nWait, the cell (5,3) is 1, and adjacent to (5,4) F. So the other adjacent cells are safe. For example, (6,3) is 2. But that's already revealed.\n\nAnother example: the cell (5,5) is 1. Adjacent cells include (5,4) F, which satisfies the 1. So other adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells to (5,5) are (4,4) 2, (4,5) 1, (4,6) 1, (5,4) F, (5,6) 1, (6,4) 3, (6,5) 3, (6,6) 2. All of these are revealed numbers or flags, so no unexplored cells here.\n\nHmm. Let's look at row 7, column 4 is unexplored (.). The cell (7,4) is . Adjacent cells include (6,3) 2, (6,4) 3, (6,5) 3, (7,3) 2, (7,5) F, (8,3) 2, (8,4) F, (8,5) F. The cell (7,4) is unexplored. The adjacent numbers are 2,3,3,2, and flags F. Let's check if any of these numbers indicate that (7,4) is safe.\n\nThe cell (6,4) is 3. Adjacent flags are (5,4) F and (7,5) F. So two flags. The number is 3, so one more bomb is needed. The unexplored cells adjacent to (6,4) are (7,4) and (7,3) (which is 2). So (7,4) could be a bomb. But we can't be sure.\n\nThe cell (7,3) is 2. Adjacent flags are (8,4) F. So one flag. Needs one more bomb. The unexplored cells are (7,4) and (7,2). So (7,4) could be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, (7,4) is a potential bomb. But since we have flags remaining, perhaps we should flag it. But we need to ensure it doesn't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, the cell (7,4) could be a bomb, but without more info, it's risky to flag it.\n\nAnother approach: since there are 10 bombs and 9 flags placed, but flags remaining are 2, there's an inconsistency. This suggests that at least one flag is incorrect. The most likely candidates are the three flags in row 7 (columns 5,6,7) and the two in row 8 (columns 4,5). Let's consider removing one of these flags.\n\nFor example, if we remove the flag at (7,5), then the cell (6,6) would have three adjacent flags (5,7), (7,6), (7,7). But (6,6) is 2, so that's still a conflict. So need to remove more.\n\nAlternatively, removing all three flags in row 7. But that would require three flag removals, which is possible but time-consuming.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the safest move is to reveal a cell that is guaranteed safe based on existing numbers.\n\nLooking back, the cell (4,9) is already revealed. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, looking at row 9, column 6 is _ (empty). Adjacent cells include (8,5) F, (8,6) 3, (8,7) _, (9,5) 1, (9,7) _, (9,8) 1. The cell (9,6) is unexplored. The 3 at (8,6) has adjacent flags (7,5) F, (8,5) F. So two flags. Needs one more bomb. The unexplored cells are (8,7), (9,6), (9,7). So one of these must be a bomb. But we can't determine which.\n\nAnother cell to consider: row 7, column 8 is _ (empty). Adjacent cells include (6,7) 1, (6,8) 1, (7,7) F, (7,9) _, (8,7) _, (8,8) 1, (8,9) 1. The cell (7,8) is unexplored. The 1 at (6,7) is already satisfied by (7,7) F. So (7,8) could be safe. But (7,7) is F, which is adjacent to (7,8). But since (6,7) is 1 and already has (7,7) F, the other adjacent cells to (6,7) must be safe. So (7,8) is adjacent to (6,7) 1. Since (6,7) is 1 and already has (7,7) F, (7,8) must be safe. Therefore, (7,8) can be safely revealed.\n\nYes! This seems like a valid move. The cell (7,8) is unexplored (currently _? Wait, looking at the board state for row 7:\n\nRow 7: . 1 _ 2 F F F _ _ _\n\nSo columns 7,8,9 are _, _, _. Wait, no. Row 7's columns are:\n\n0: ., 1:1, 2:_, 3:2, 4:F, 5:F, 6:F, 7:_, 8:_, 9:_.\n\nSo (7,7) is _, which is empty revealed. (7,8) is _, also empty. (7,9) is _. So those are already revealed. So perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the cell (7,8) is _, which is empty. So it's already revealed. Therefore, not unexplored.\n\nHmm. Let's try to find another cell.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 7 is _ (empty). Adjacent cells include (7,6) F, (7,7) F, (7,8) _, (8,6) 3, (8,8) 1, (9,6) _, (9,7) _, (9,8) 1. The cell (8,7) is empty. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the cell (6,2) is _ (empty), but adjacent to (6,3) 2. The cell (6,3) is 2. Adjacent flags are (5,4) F. So one flag. Needs one more bomb. The unexplored cells adjacent to (6,3) are (5,2) _, (6,2) _, (7,2) _, (7,4) _. But (5,2) is already revealed as empty. (6,2) is empty. (7,2) is unexplored. So the bomb must be at (7,2) or (7,4). But we can't determine which.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the best move is to reveal a cell that is likely safe based on the numbers. For example, the cell (7,4) is unexplored and adjacent to several numbers. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8, column 7 is empty. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's check the cell (9,9) which is unexplored. Adjacent cells are (8,8) 1, (8,9) 1, (9,8) 1. Each of these 1s must have one bomb. The cell (8,9) is 1. Adjacent cells include (7,8) _, (7,9) _, (8,8) 1, (9,8) 1, (9,9) .. So the 1 at (8,9) needs one bomb. The unexplored cells are (7,8), (7,9), (9,9). If (9,9) is a bomb, then the 1 at (8,9) is satisfied. But also, the 1 at (9,8) is adjacent to (9,9). So if (9,9) is a bomb, then the 1 at (9,8) would have two bombs ( (9,9) and possibly another). But the 1 at (9,8) can only have one. Therefore, (9,9) cannot be a bomb. Therefore, (9,9) must be safe. This is a classic 1-1-1 corner pattern. \n\nIn this case, the three 1s at (8,8), (8,9), and (9,8) form a corner. Each 1 needs one bomb. The shared cell (9,9) can't be a bomb because it would affect all three 1s. Therefore, (9,9) must be safe. This is a common Minesweeper pattern. Therefore, the cell (9,9) can be safely revealed.\n\nSo the move would be to reveal (9,9). This is a safe move based on the 1-1-1 corner pattern.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (9,9) is surrounded by three 1s (at (8,8), (8,9), and (9,8)). According to the 1-1-1 corner pattern, (9,9) must be safe because placing a bomb there would cause the adjacent 1s to have more than one bomb each. Therefore, revealing (9,9) is safe.\n\nMOVE: 9,9,false", "flags_remaining": 2, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n2 _ _ 1 1 2 F 1 _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 F 2 1 1 _ _ _\n4 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _\n5 . 1 _ 1 F 1 1 F 1 _\n6 . 1 _ 2 3 3 2 1 1 _\n7 . 1 _ 2 F F F _ _ _\n8 . 1 _ 2 F 3 1 _ 1 1\n9 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .", "sucess": false}
