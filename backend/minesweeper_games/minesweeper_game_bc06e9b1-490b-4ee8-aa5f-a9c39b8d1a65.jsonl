For instance, revealing a tile next to a '1' could help identify where a bomb is located if there's only one possible position left for a bomb adjacent to that '1'.

Given the rules and the state of the board, a strategic move would be to reveal a tile that could provide the most information about the board's state. Looking at the board, revealing a tile adjacent to a revealed number could help in deducing the location of bombs. Specifically, revealing a tile next to a '1' could be very informative because if a '1' is adjacent to a revealed tile, it significantly limits where a bomb could be. The position (1,0) is adjacent to a '2', which could give us insight into the distribution of bombs around it. However, considering the goal of maximizing information gain, revealing a tile next to a '1' is preferable. The tile at position (4,1) is a good candidate because it is adjacent to a '1' (at position (3,1)) and could help clarify the bomb's location near that '1'.\n\nMOVE: 4,1,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 2 2 1 1 1 1 _ 1 . .\n2 . . . . . 1 _ 1 2 .\n3 . 3 1 1 1 1 _ _ 1 .\n4 . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 .\n5 1 1 _ _ 1 1 2 . . .\n6 _ _ _ _ 1 . 2 . . .\n7 _ _ 1 1 2 . . . . .\n8 _ _ 2 . . . . . . .\n9 _ _ 2 . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
