This means every flag placed must correspond to a bomb.\n\n### Specific Observations:\n\n- **Position (0,1):** Revealed as '1'. Adjacent unexplored tiles: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n  - Since (0,1) is '1', and there are no adjacent flags, one of these unexplored tiles must be a bomb.\n\n- **Position (1,1):** Revealed as '1'.

Therefore, the bomb must be either at (0,0) or (1,0).\n\n2. At position (1,1), the number '1' is also revealed. Its adjacent unexplored squares are (1,0), (0,0), and (2,0). Since we already know from (0,1) that the bomb must be at (0,0) or (1,0), and (1,1) also indicates a bomb at one of these positions, we can conclude that the bomb must be at (1,0).

The adjacent unexplored tiles are `(0,2)` and `(1,2)`. Only one of these can be a bomb. Therefore, if we can determine that one of them is a bomb, the other must be safe.\n\n   - **Tile (1,5):** Shows `2` with no adjacent flags. The adjacent unexplored tiles are `(0,4)`, `(0,6)`, `(1,4)`, `(1,6)`, `(2,4)`, `(2,5)`, `(2,6)`. We need to identify two bombs among these.\n\n   - **Tile (2,5):** Shows `2` with no adjacent flags. The adjacent unexplored tiles overlap with those of `(1,5)`. This consistency suggests that the bombs are likely in the overlapping areas.\n\n3. **Considering the Remaining Number of Flags vs Bombs**\n\n   - **Flags remaining:** 8\n   - **Bombs:** 10\n\n   This means there are 10 bombs on the board, and we have placed 2 flags so far (`(1,0)` and `(2,1)`). Therefore, we have 8 more flags to place.\n\n### **Identifying Safe Moves and Potential Bomb Locations**\n\nLet's focus on areas where we can confidently determine the location of bombs or safe tiles.\n\n1. **Tile (0,3):** Shows `1` with adjacent unexplored tiles `(0,2)` and `(1,2)`.\n\n   - If we can determine that one of these is a bomb, the other must be safe.\n\n   - Let's check if either `(0,2)` or `(1,2)` must be a bomb.\n\n     - **Tile (1,1):** Shows `1` with adjacent flagged tile `(1,0)` (`F`). Therefore, there can be no other bombs adjacent to `(1,1)`.\n\n     - **Tile (1,2):** Is adjacent to `(1,1)`. Since `(1,1)` already has one adjacent bomb (`(1,0)`), `(1,2)` cannot be a bomb.\n\n     - **Conclusion:** `(1,2)` is safe, and `(0,2)` must be the bomb adjacent to `(0,3)`.\n\n2. **Tile (0,5):** Shows `2` with adjacent unexplored tiles `(0,4)`, `(0,6)`, `(1,4)`, `(1,5)`, `(1,6)`.\n\n   - We need to identify two bombs among these.\n\n   - Let's cross-reference with other tiles.\n\n     - **Tile (0,3):** We've determined that `(0,2)` is a bomb.\n\n     - **Tile (1,5):** Shows `2` with adjacent unexplored tiles overlapping with those of `(0,5)`.\n\n     - **Tile (2,5):** Shows `2` with adjacent unexplored tiles overlapping with those of `(0,5)` and `(1,5)`.\n\n   - It's challenging to determine exact bomb locations here without more information. We'll need to look elsewhere for safer moves.\n\n3. **Tile (5,0):** Shows `1` with adjacent unexplored tiles `(4,0)`, `(4,1)`, `(5,1)`.\n\n   - **Tile (4,1):** Shows `1` with adjacent unexplored tiles `(3,0)`, `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`, `(4,0)`, `(4,2)`, `(5,0)`, `(5,1)`, `(5,2)`.\n\n     - **Tile (3,1):** Shows `1` with adjacent flagged tile `(2,1)` (`F`). Therefore, there can be no other bombs adjacent to `(3,1)`.\n\n     - **Tile (4,1):** Is adjacent to `(3,1)`. Since `(3,1)` already has one adjacent bomb (`(2,1)`), `(4,1)` cannot be a bomb.\n\n     - **Conclusion:** `(4,1)` is safe.\n\n   - **Tile (5,1):** Shows `1` with adjacent unexplored tiles `(4,0)`, `(4,1)`, `(4,2)`, `(5,0)`, `(5,2)`, `(6,0)`, `(6,1)`, `(6,2)`.\n\n     - We've already determined that `(4,1)` is safe.\n\n     - **Tile (5,0):** Shows `1` with adjacent unexplored tiles `(4,0)`, `(4,1)`, `(5,1)`.\n\n       - Since `(4,1)` is safe, the bomb must be either `(4,0)` or `(5,1)`.\n\n     - **Tile (5,1):** If `(5,1)` were a bomb, then `(5,0)` would have its required one bomb adjacent (`(5,1)`), and `(5,1)` would satisfy its own `1` adjacent bomb (`(6,1)`).\n\n       - However, let's check `(6,1)`.\n\n         - **Tile (6,1):** Is unexplored. If `(5,1)` is a bomb, then `(6,1)` would be safe.\n\n     - **Conclusion:** It's plausible that `(5,1)` is a bomb, and `(4,0)` is safe.\n\n     - However, we need to confirm this.\n\n     - **Tile (5,0):** If `(5,1)` is a bomb, then `(5,0)` has its required one bomb adjacent.\n\n     - **Tile (5,1):** If `(5,1)` is a bomb, then `(5,0)` and `(6,1)` are affected.\n\n     - **Tile (6,1):** If `(5,1)` is a bomb, then `(6,1)` is safe.\n\n     - **Tile (6,0):** Is unexplored and adjacent to `(5,0)` and `(5,1)`.\n\n       - If `(5,1)` is a bomb, then `(6,0)` is safe.\n\n     - **Conclusion:** Placing a flag on `(5,1)` seems consistent.\n\n### **Making the Next Move**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **Tile (0,2):** Must be a bomb adjacent to `(0,3)`.\n  \n  - **Action:** Place a flag on `(0,2)`.\n\n- **Tile (5,1):** Likely a bomb based on the adjacent tiles.\n\n  - **Action:** Place a flag on `(5,1)`.\n\nHowever, since we can only make one move at a time, we'll prioritize the most certain move.\n\n**Most Certain Move:**\n\n- **Tile (0,2):** Determined to be a bomb based on the adjacent numbers.\n\n**Move:**\n\n```\nEXPLANATION: Based on the number at (0,3) showing '1' and the adjacent tile (1,2) being safe, (0,2) must be a bomb.\nMOVE: 0,2,true\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nAfter placing a flag on `(0,2)`:\n\n- **Tile (0,3):** Now has its required one adjacent bomb (`(0,2)`).\n  \n- **Tile (0,1):** Adjacent to `(0,0)` (empty), `(0,2)` (flagged), `(1,0)` (flagged), `(1,1)` (1), `(1,2)` (safe). \n\n  - Only one adjacent bomb (`(1,0)`), which matches the number `1`.\n\nThis move is consistent and reduces the number of remaining flags to 7.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n```\nEXPLANATION: Based on the number at (0,3) showing '1' and the adjacent tile (1,2) being safe, (0,2) must be a bomb.\nMOVE: 0,2,true\n```", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . 1 _ 2 . . . .\n1 F 1 1 1 _ 2 . . . .\n2 _ F _ _ 1 2 . . . .\n3 1 1 _ _ 2 . . . . .\n4 . 1 _ _ 2 . . . . .\n5 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 . .\n8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": true}

The adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5). However, (1,5) is already flagged, so the bombs must be among (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), and (1,4).\n\nSimilarly, position (2,5) has a number '2' with no adjacent flags.

Here's what I observed:\n\n- **Revealed Squares:** There are several revealed squares with numbers (1, 2) indicating the number of adjacent bombs.\n  \n- **Flagged Squares:** There are flags (`F`) placed at specific positions, presumably marking where bombs are suspected to be.\n  \n- **Unexplored Squares:** The dots (`.`) represent squares that haven't been revealed yet.\n\n### **Analyzing the Numbers and Flags**\n\nI started by checking the revealed numbers against the existing flags to ensure consistency.\n\n1. **At Position (0,1):** The number `1` is adjacent to one bomb. There's a flag at (0,2), which means the bomb at (0,2) satisfies this number. Therefore, no other adjacent squares should contain bombs.\n\n2. **At Position (0,4):** The number `2` is adjacent to two bombs. There's a flag at (1,5), but that's only one bomb. This means there must be another bomb adjacent to (0,4).\n\n3. **At Position (1,1):** The number `1` is adjacent to one bomb. There's a flag at (1,0), satisfying this number. No other adjacent squares should contain bombs.\n\n4. **At Position (1,5):** There's a flag here, but it's adjacent to the number `2` at (0,4). As previously noted, since only one bomb is flagged adjacent to (0,4), there must be another bomb nearby.\n\n5. **At Position (2,1):** The flag here is adjacent to the number `1` at (1,1), which is already satisfied by the flag at (1,0). This suggests that the flag at (2,1) might be unnecessary or possibly incorrect.\n\n### **Identifying Potential Conflicts**\n\nLooking deeper, I noticed a potential conflict at position (2,1):\n\n- **Position (2,1):** The flag here is adjacent to the number `1` at (1,1). However, the number `1` at (1,1) is already satisfied by the flag at (1,0). This implies that the flag at (2,1) might be incorrectly placed, as it would suggest an additional bomb adjacent to (1,1), which contradicts the number `1`.\n\n### **Considering the Remaining Flags and Bombs**\n\nThere are a total of 10 bombs on the board, and currently, 5 flags have been placed, meaning there are 5 bombs remaining to be flagged. It's essential to ensure that each flag corresponds to an actual bomb to avoid inconsistencies.\n\n### **Deciding the Next Move**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n1. **Remove the Flag at (2,1):** Since the flag at (2,1) conflicts with the number `1` at (1,1), which is already satisfied by the flag at (1,0), it's logical to remove this flag to maintain consistency.\n\n2. **Reveal Adjacent Squares:** After removing the flag, I can consider revealing adjacent unexplored squares around positions where numbers indicate the presence of bombs, ensuring that all numbered squares are correctly accounted for.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nGiven the conflict at (2,1), the most prudent move is to remove the flag there to resolve the inconsistency.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The flag at (2,1) conflicts with the number `1` at (1,1), which is already satisfied by the flag at (1,0).

This helps ensure there are no conflicts.\n\n- **Position (0,1):** Number '1'\n  - Adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n  - Flagged squares: (0,2) [F]\n  - Since there's one flag adjacent, this is consistent with the number '1'.\n\n- **Position (0,4):** Number '2'\n  - Adjacent squares: (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n  - Flagged squares: (1,5) [F]\n  - Only one flag adjacent, so there must be one more bomb in the remaining adjacent squares.\n\n- **Position (1,1):** Number '1'\n  - Adjacent squares: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n  - Flagged squares: (0,0) [F], (0,2) [F]\n  - Two flags adjacent, but the number is '1'.

Let's examine the two flagged squares:\n\n- **Flag at (0,0):**\n  - Adjacent to (0,1) [1], (1,0) [F], (1,1) [1]\n  - If I remove this flag, does it create any new conflicts?\n\n- **Flag at (0,2):**\n  - Adjacent to (0,1) [1], (0,3) [1], (1,1) [1], (1,2) [1]\n  - If I remove this flag, does it create any new conflicts?\n\nLet's analyze both scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1: Remove flag at (0,0)**\n- Position (0,1) [1] would have no adjacent flags, so there must be one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n- Position (1,1) [1] would have one adjacent flag at (0,2), which is consistent.\n\n**Scenario 2: Remove flag at (0,2)**\n- Position (0,1) [1] would have no adjacent flags, so there must be one bomb in its adjacent squares.\n- Position (1,1) [1] would have one adjacent flag at (0,0), which is consistent.\n\nBoth scenarios seem valid, but let's see if removing one flag affects other numbers.\n\nLooking at position (0,1) [1], if we remove the flag at (0,0), the remaining adjacent squares are (0,2) [F], (1,0) [F], (1,1) [1], (1,2) [1]. Since (0,2) is flagged, and (1,0) is flagged, but (1,1) is '1', it's still consistent.\n\nSimilarly, if we remove the flag at (0,2), position (0,1) [1] would have adjacent squares (0,0) [F], (1,0) [F], (1,1) [1], (1,2) [1].

Reveal all safe squares, or\n2. Correctly flag all bombs.\n\nWe need to make a move that brings us closer to one of these objectives without accidentally revealing a bomb.\n\n### **Analyzing the Board**\n\n**Step 1: Check Revealed Numbers Against Existing Flags**\n\nWe'll examine each revealed number to ensure that the number of adjacent flags matches the number indicated. If there's a discrepancy, it could indicate a misflagged or unmarked bomb.\n\n**Row 0:**\n- (0,0): Flagged (`F`)\n- (0,1): `1`\n  - Adjacent to (0,0) `F` and (0,2) `F`\n  - Number `1` suggests only one bomb adjacent, but there are two flags here. This is a conflict.\n  \n**Conclusion:** There's a conflict at (0,1) because the number `1` has two adjacent flags, which is impossible.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Resolve Conflicts**\n\nGiven the conflict at (0,1), we need to determine which of the adjacent flags is incorrectly placed.\n\n- **Flag at (0,0):**\n  - Adjacent numbers: (0,1) `1` and (1,0) `F`\n  - If (0,0) were a bomb, then (0,1) should only have one bomb adjacent, but (0,2) is also flagged, causing the conflict.\n\n- **Flag at (0,2):**\n  - Adjacent numbers: (0,1) `1` and (1,2) `1`\n  - If (0,2) were a bomb, then (0,1) would have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts its number `1`.\n\n**Resolution:**\nSince both flags at (0,0) and (0,2) cause conflicts with (0,1) `1`, we need to remove one of them. However, we must ensure that removing a flag doesn't introduce new inconsistencies.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the Remaining Number of Flags vs. Bombs**\n\nTotal bombs: 10\nFlags placed: Let's count the existing flags.\n\nCounting the flags:\n- (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,5), (2,4) \u2192 5 flags\nFlags remaining: 5\n\nSince all bombs are accounted for with flags, and there's a conflict, it suggests that one of these flags is incorrect.\n\n**Step 4: Deciding Which Flag to Remove**\n\nLet's analyze each flagged square:\n\n- **(0,0):**\n  - Adjacent numbers: (0,1) `1` and (1,0) `F`\n  - If (0,0) is a bomb, then (0,1) should have only one bomb adjacent, but (0,2) is also flagged, leading to a conflict.\n\n- **(0,2):**\n  - Adjacent numbers: (0,1) `1` and (1,2) `1`\n  - If (0,2) is a bomb, then (0,1) would have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts its number `1`.\n\nGiven this analysis, both flags at (0,0) and (0,2) seem problematic. However, since (0,1) `1` can only have one bomb adjacent, and both flags are adjacent to it, one of these flags must be incorrect.\n\n**Step 5: Making the Move**\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we'll remove one of the flags. Since both flags are causing issues, removing either would help, but let's choose the flag at (0,0).\n\n**Move:**\n`MOVE: 0,0,true` (This command would remove the flag at (0,0))\n\nHowever, according to the rules, to remove a flag, we need to make a move with `flag=true` on an already flagged square. Therefore, the correct move to remove the flag at (0,0) is:\n\n`MOVE: 0,0,true`\n\n**But wait!** Actually, the instruction says:\n\n\"To remove a flag, make a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\"\n\nSo, to remove the flag at (0,0), we should place a flag there again, which would toggle it off.\n\nBut to clarify, in many Minesweeper implementations, toggling a flag on an already flagged square removes it. Therefore, the correct move to remove the flag at (0,0) is:\n\n`MOVE: 0,0,true`\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nAfter careful analysis, the conflict at (0,1) requires removing one of the adjacent flags. Removing the flag at (0,0) resolves this inconsistency.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** There's a conflict at (0,1) with number `1` having two adjacent flags.

Having two flags here means one of them is incorrect.\n\n#### Position (0,3): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,2): Flag (F)\n  \nHere, the number '1' has one adjacent flag, which is consistent.\n\n#### Position (0,5): Number 2\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,4): Empty (_)\n- (1,4): Unexplored (.)\n- (1,5): Flag (F)\n  \nThe number '2' has one adjacent flag, so there must be one more bomb in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (1,1): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (1,0): Flag (F)\n  \nConsistent, as there's one adjacent flag.\n\n#### Position (1,2): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,2): Flag (F)\n  \nConsistent, with one adjacent flag.\n\n#### Position (1,3): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,3): Number 1\n- (0,4): Empty (_)\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so this '1' indicates there's one bomb in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (2,5): Number 2\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (1,5): Flag (F)\n- (2,4): Flag (F)\n  \nThe number '2' has two adjacent flags, which is consistent.\n\n#### Position (3,0): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (3,1): Number 1\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so one bomb is in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (3,1): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (3,0): Number 1\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so one bomb is in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (3,4): Number 2\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (2,4): Flag (F)\n- (3,3): Unexplored (.)\n  \nThe number '2' has one adjacent flag, so there must be one more bomb in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (4,1): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (4,0): Unexplored (.)\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so one bomb is in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (4,4): Number 2\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (3,4): Number 2\n- (4,3): Unexplored (.)\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so there are two bombs in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (5,0): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (5,1): Number 1\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so one bomb is in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (5,1): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (5,0): Number 1\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so one bomb is in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (5,4): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (5,3): Unexplored (.)\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so one bomb is in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (5,5): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (5,4): Number 1\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so one bomb is in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (5,6): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (5,5): Number 1\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so one bomb is in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (5,7): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (5,6): Number 1\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so one bomb is in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (5,8): Unexplored (.)\n\n#### Position (6,7): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (6,6): Unexplored (.)\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so one bomb is in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (7,7): Number 2\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (6,7): Number 1\n- (7,6): Unexplored (.)\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so there are two bombs in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (8,7): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (8,6): Unexplored (.)\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so one bomb is in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n#### Position (9,7): Number 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (9,6): Unexplored (.)\n  \nNo adjacent flags, so one bomb is in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Conflicts\n\nFrom the analysis above, the only conflict is at position (0,1), which shows a '1' but has two adjacent flags at (0,0) and (0,2). This means one of these flags is incorrect.\n\n### Step 4: Deciding Which Flag to Remove\n\nTo resolve the conflict at (0,1), I need to determine which of the two flags is incorrect.\n\n#### Examining Flag at (0,0):\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,1): Number 1\n- (1,0): Flag (F)\n\nAt (1,0), there's another flag. Let's check the number at (1,1):\n\n- Position (1,1): Number 1\n  - Adjacent squares: (1,0): Flag (F)\n  \nThis is consistent since the number '1' has one adjacent flag.\n\nSo, the flag at (0,0) seems consistent with the number at (1,1).\n\n#### Examining Flag at (0,2):\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,1): Number 1\n- (0,3): Number 1\n- (1,2): Number 1\n\nAt (0,1), we already have a conflict due to two flags. At (0,3), the number is '1' with one adjacent flag at (0,2), which is consistent. At (1,2), the number is '1' with one adjacent flag at (0,2), also consistent.\n\nHowever, since (0,1) shows a '1' but has two adjacent flags, and the flag at (0,0) is consistent with (1,1), it suggests that the flag at (0,2) might be the incorrect one.\n\n### Step 5: Removing the Incorrect Flag\n\nBased on the above reasoning, I'll remove the flag at (0,2).\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Decision\n\nAfter removing the flag at (0,2), let's re-examine position (0,1):\n\n- Position (0,1): Number 1\n  - Adjacent squares: (0,0): Flag (F)\n\nNow, there's only one adjacent flag, which matches the number '1'. The conflict is resolved.\n\n### Step 7: Considering Other Areas for Moves\n\nNext, I'll look for safe moves or additional flags to place.\n\n#### Position (0,4): Empty (_)\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (0,3): Number 1\n- (0,5): Number 2\n- (1,4): Unexplored (.)\n  \nSince (0,3) has one adjacent flag at (0,2) (which we removed), and (0,5) has one adjacent flag at (1,5), I need to check if there are any bombs in the adjacent unexplored squares.\n\nAt (0,3):\n\n- Number '1' with one adjacent flag at (0,2) (removed), so there should be one bomb in the adjacent unexplored squares: (0,4) and (1,4).\n\nAt (0,5):\n\n- Number '2' with one adjacent flag at (1,5), so there must be one more bomb in the adjacent unexplored squares: (0,4), (1,4), (1,5).\n\nGiven that (1,5) is already flagged, and (0,4) is empty, the bomb must be at (1,4).\n\nTherefore, I can safely place a flag at (1,4).\n\n### Step 8: Placing a Flag at (1,4)\n\nI'll place a flag at (1,4) to mark the bomb.\n\n### Step 9: Finalizing the Next Move\n\nAfter removing the incorrect flag at (0,2) and placing a new flag at (1,4), I need to decide the next move.\n\nLooking at position (1,4), which is now flagged, let's check adjacent numbers:\n\n- Position (0,4): Empty (_)\n- Position (1,5): Flag (F)\n- Position (2,4): Flag (F)\n\nAt (0,4), it's already empty, so no action is needed there.\n\nAt (0,5):\n\n- Number '2' with two adjacent flags at (1,4) and (1,5), which is consistent.\n\nNow, looking for safe reveals:\n\n#### Position (3,3): Unexplored (.)\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (3,2): Unexplored (.)\n- (3,4): Number 2\n- (4,3): Unexplored (.)\n\nAt (3,4):\n\n- Number '2' with one adjacent flag at (2,4), so there must be one more bomb in the adjacent unexplored squares: (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nGiven that there's only one more bomb needed, and there are multiple possible locations, it's not safe to reveal (3,3) yet.\n\n#### Position (4,0): Unexplored (.)\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (4,1): Number 1\n  \nAt (4,1):\n\n- Number '1' with no adjacent flags, so there must be one bomb in the adjacent unexplored squares: (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (5,0).\n\nGiven that (5,0) is unexplored, and (3,0) is a number '1' with no adjacent flags, it's safer to reveal (4,0) to gather more information.\n\n### Step 10: Revealing Position (4,0)\n\nI'll reveal position (4,0) to see if it's safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter careful analysis, my next moves are:\n\n1. **Remove the incorrect flag at (0,2).**\n2. **Place a flag at (1,4).**\n3. **Reveal position (4,0).**\n\nSince the task is to provide the next move in the specified format, I'll choose the first action:\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Removed the flag at (0,2) because it caused a conflict with the number '1' at (0,1), which should only have one adjacent bomb.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,2,false (remove the flag at (0,2))", "flags_remaining": 5, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 F 1 F 1 _ 2 . . . .\n1 F 1 1 1 _ F . . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ F 2 . . . .\n3 1 1 _ _ 2 . . . . .\n4 . 1 _ _ 2 . . . . .\n5 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 1 . .\n6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 . .\n8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . .", "sucess": false}
