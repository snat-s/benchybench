We need to ensure that the numbers correspond correctly to the number of neighboring flagged tiles and that we don't create any contradictions in flag placement based on the adjacent numbers.\n   - Each '1' can have at most one adjacent flag; any flag placed adjacent to a '1' must account for that.\n   - A '2' adjacent to one flag must have one more adjacent bomb.\n\n2. **Observe Existing Flags and Adjacent Numbers:**\n   - Row 3, Column 2 (3, 2) shows '1' and has the following neighbors:\n     - (2, 2)\n     - (3, 1)\n     - (3, 3)\n     - (4, 1)\n     - (4, 2)\n   - If (3, 1) (above) is flagged, then these adjacent tiles must not have additional bombs, making other considerations for flags in that area vital.\n\n3. **Identify Safe Reveals:**\n   - Tiles that could safely be revealed next are tiles with low-numbered adjacent bombs that have not been flagged or revealed yet, such as (8, 0) or (8, 1) that are empty.\n\n4. **Plan the Next Move:**\n   - I will reveal (3, 3), which currently shows the number 2. This may help clarify the surrounding threats and number claims.\n\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal the tile at (3, 3) to gather more information on adjacent bombs since it shows a '2', indicating that further analysis on neighboring tiles is essential. \nMOVE: 3,3,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 2 . . . . . .\n4 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n5 _ _ 2 . . . . . . .\n6 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n7 1 1 2 . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 8, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "To analyze the current board state, let\u2019s evaluate the revealed numbers and the potential placement of flags.\n\n**Revealed Numbers and Their Surroundings:**\n- The numbers indicate potential bombs adjacent to them. We can use these numbers to determine where to place flags. \n- The board shows a pattern where numbers adjacent to empty revealed spaces (underscored) make it possible to derive the locations of bombs.\n\n**Specific Analysis:**\n1. The number at (3,2) is '1' and has no flags adjacent to it, so ideally, it should have one bomb among its adjacent squares.\n2. The number at (3,3) is '2' and currently has one probable flag adjacent to it. Therefore, there must be one more bomb in that vicinity.\n3. The number at (5,2) is '2' and has one adjacent flag, meaning another bomb must be in the adjacent squares.\n4. Observing the other numbers near the bottom row (as they are less restrictive due to being lower numbers), I notice that the cells bordered with '0's or at least fewer bomb-claiming cells might not have bombs, which allow revealing those tiles.\n\n**Next Move Decision:**\nThe safest move is to reveal the tile at (8,0). This position has a '0' adjacent to it and does not conflict with any flags. Revealing this will give us additional information about the surrounding area.\n\nEXPLANATION: The tile (8,0) is part of an isolated area that likely doesn\u2019t contain any bombs, and revealing it will help confirm safe areas while adhering to the flag placement rules.\nMOVE: 8,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 2 . . . . . .\n4 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n5 _ _ 2 . . . . . . .\n6 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n7 1 1 2 . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

For example, the number '1' at (0, 3) currently has no adjacent flags, suggesting it can only have one bomb among its eight neighboring tiles. Similarly, the '2' at (3, 3) currently has one adjacent flag; thus one more bomb must be placed in its other neighboring tiles.

This means there is a bomb at that location.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Each Relevant Number**:\n   - (3, 2) is '1': This means there is 1 bomb adjacent to this tile. Given that it has one adjacent flag, there can be no additional bomb nearby. (Confirmed safe)\n   - (3, 3) is '2': This tile reveals that there are 2 bombs adjacent to it. Adjacent tiles are (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), and (3, 4) itself. Since one adjacent square already has a flag (3, 4), there must be one more bomb among the other tiles.\n   - (5, 2) is '2': Needs 2 bombs adjacent to it, with only one flag adjacent (3, 4) already known. This means we are unsure if there are bombs at (5, 1) or (4, 3) yet.\n   - Other numbers\u2014such as (1, 3) and (1, 2) again fit the vicinity but yield no new information as related flags or bombs are still pending confirmation.\n\n4. **Remaining Flags**: There are 9 flags remaining, and given that there are 10 bombs total, the flags represent a crucial resource to ensure safety from further detonation.\n\n5. **Decision**: \n   - The next logical step is to reveal a tile to possibly find safe numbers or create additional opportunities for flag placement.\n   - The most strategic choice is to reveal tile (4, 3) as it is adjacent to several numbers, shedding light on potential future game states.\n\nThus, we will proceed with the following move:\n\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal tile (4, 3) as it is essential to uncover new information about adjacent bombs and numbers.\nMOVE: 4,3,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n1 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n2 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 2 F . . . . .\n4 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n5 _ _ 2 . . . . . . .\n6 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n7 1 1 2 . . . . . . .\n8 1 . . . . . . . . .\n9 1 1 . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
