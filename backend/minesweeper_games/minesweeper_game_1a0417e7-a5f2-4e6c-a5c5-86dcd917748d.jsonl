It only has 3 adjacent squares (compared to 8 for center squares)\n2. This reduces the probability of hitting a bomb on our first move\n3.

Looking at row 4, the '3' at (4,1) has no flags around it yet, which means there must be 3 bombs in its adjacent squares.\n\n2. We can see that (4,2) shows '2', meaning 2 bombs are adjacent to it. Given the '3' next to it, we can deduce that two of the bombs must be in the unexplored squares at (3,1) and (5,1).\n\n3. Looking at the pattern of the '3' and '2', and considering that (4,3) shows '1', we can confidently determine that (3,1) must be a bomb location, as it's adjacent to both the '3' and '2'.\n\nEXPLANATION: The '3' at (4,1) combined with the '2' at (4,2) and '1' at (4,3) indicates that (3,1) must be a bomb location.
