This location often gives a good spread of information to begin deducing bomb locations.

We need to ensure we make a safe move while aiming to identify all the bombs.\n\nLooking at the visible numbers:\n\n- At coordinates (4,3), the number '2' indicates that there are 2 bombs adjacent. Since one of its adjacent spots (4,4) is already revealed as containing '2', we must focus on the other adjacent unexplored spaces.\n  \n- Coordinate (4,4) is surrounded by several unexplored tiles: (3,4), (4,2), but since it's revealing a '2' and we know that (4,3) already demands 2 bombs, we must then assume (4,4) shares a bomb placement responsibility with (4,3).\n\n- By focusing on (4,3), there are two unexplored spots adjacent to it at (5,3) and (5,4). We can deduce that these contain bombs justifying the '2' at both (4,4) and (4,3).\n\nTherefore, the first step should be to place a flag at (5,4) because it is highly likely to contain a bomb.\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the number '2' at (4,3), we must place flags on two of its adjacent unexplored tiles. One of these is (5,4), which satisfies the number '2' requirement at both (4,3) and being sightly suspicious for (4,4). This ensures we correctly flag a bomb without causing conflicts with other uncovered numbers. \n\nMOVE: 5,4,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n1 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n2 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n3 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n4 . . . 2 2 _ _ 1 1 1\n5 . . . . 1 _ _ 1 . .\n6 . . . . 1 1 1 3 . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
