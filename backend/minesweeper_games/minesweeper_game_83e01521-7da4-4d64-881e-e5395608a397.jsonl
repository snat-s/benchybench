I'll start by reviewing the current state and look for any obvious moves.\n\nFirst, let's check the board size (10x10), flags remaining (10), and total bombs (10). So we need to place a total of 10 flags, and we haven't placed any yet.\n\nLet me analyze the board region by region, looking for constrainted areas where I can determine safe moves or definite mines.\n\nStarting with the top-left region (rows 0-3, columns 0-4):\n- We have revealed numbers in positions (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n- There's a '2' at (1,0), which means there are 2 bombs adjacent to it - these bombs could be at (0,0), (0,1), or (2,0)\n- There's a '2' at (1,1), which means there are 2 bombs adjacent - these could be at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (2,1)\n- There's a '1' at (1,2), which means there is 1 bomb adjacent - could be at (0,2), (0,3), or (2,3)\n- There's a '1' at (2,2), which means there is 1 bomb adjacent - could be at (1,3), (2,3), or (3,3)\n- There's a '2' at (3,0), '2' at (3,1), and '1' at (3,2)\n\nFrom the left side (rows 4-9, column 0-2):\n- We have revealed numbers at (5,1), (6,1), (7,1)\n- Each shows '1', which means there's 1 bomb adjacent to each\n\nMiddle-bottom area:\n- We have numbers at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,1)-(5,4), (6,1), (7,1)-(7,4), (8,4), (9,4)\n\nLet me try to find some certain moves:\n\nLooking at position (1,0) and (3,0) which both show '2':\n- The '2' at (1,0) shares adjacent cells with the '2' at (3,0)\n- The common adjacent cells are (2,0) and (2,1)\n- Position (2,0) is already revealed as a mine (shown as '.' in the board state)\n- This means there must be another mine at (2,1) to satisfy both '2' values\n\nWait, let me look more carefully at the board legend:\n- '_' is an empty revealed space\n- '.' is an unexplored space\n- 'F' is a flagged space\n- '*' is a revealed bomb (game over)\n- Numbers indicate adjacent bombs\n\nSo (2,0) is not revealed as a mine; it's just unexplored. Let me reconsider.\n\nLook at position (2,2) which shows '1':\n- Adjacent unexplored spaces are (1,3) and (2,3)\n- One of these must contain a bomb\n- But we can't determine which one with certainty from just this info\n\nLet's look at the right side of the board:\n- At (0,6), there's a '1' - this means one of (0,5), (1,5), (0,7) has a bomb\n- But (0,7) is revealed as safe (it's a '.'), so the bomb must be at either (0,5) or (1,5)\n\nWait, I think I'm misinterpreting the board representation. Let me clarify:\n- '.' is an unexplored space, not a revealed safe space\n- '_' is an empty revealed space\n\nSo for the '1' at (0,6), the bomb could be at (0,5), (0,7), or (1,5).\n\nLet me analyze the lower-right part of the board:\n- At (8,7), there's a '2'\n- The adjacent unexplored spaces are (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7)\n- So 2 of those 4 spaces must contain bombs\n\nLet me check for any definite moves:\n\nLooking at coordinates (6,1) with a '1':\n- Adjacent unexplored cells are (5,0), (6,0), (7,0)\n- One of these must contain a bomb\n\nLooking at (5,4) and (7,4) both with a '1':\n- They share adjacent unexplored cells at (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n- Since both need exactly one bomb, and they share these cells, there must be exactly one bomb in these shared cells\n\nLet's check position (5,5) which is revealed as safe (it's a '.' in the diagram, which means unexplored, not necessarily safe)\n\nLet me try to find a definite safe move or a definite flag placement.\n\nLooking at (1,2) which shows '1':\n- Adjacent unexplored spaces are (0,2) and (0,3), (1,3)\n- We know there's exactly one bomb adjacent to (1,2)\n\nLooking at the region around (6,7) which shows '2':\n- Adjacent unexplored spaces are (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8)\n- We need to place exactly 2 bombs here\n\nLooking at (8,7) which shows '2':\n- Adjacent unexplored spaces are (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8)\n- We need to place exactly 2 bombs here\n\nI need to find patterns or overlaps that help identify specific safe or dangerous cells.\n\nLet me look at the pattern between (4,7) with a '1' and (6,7) with a '2':\n- They share adjacent unexplored cells at (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)\n- (4,7) has only one bomb adjacent, which could be at (3,8), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), or (5,8)\n- (6,7) has two bombs adjacent, which could be at (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), or (7,8)\n\nLet me try to focus on some specific areas where I might find a definitive move:\n\nLooking at the top-left corner (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3):\n- All adjacent revealed cells are (1,0):'2', (1,1):'2', (1,2):'1'\n- This means there are 2 bombs adjacent to (1,0), 2 bombs adjacent to (1,1), and 1 bomb adjacent to (1,2)\n- Given the overlapping areas, it seems there are probably mines at (0,0) and (0,1)\n\nLet's analyze the pattern at positions (1,0):'2', (1,1):'2', (1,2):'1':\n- These three numbers constrain the unrevealed positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)\n- (1,0) sees (0,0), (0,1), (2,0)\n- (1,1) sees (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (2,1)\n- (1,2) sees (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (2,3)\n\nLet me check if I can determine a safe move at (0,3):\n- It's adjacent to (1,2):'1' and (1,3):'unknown'\n- Since (1,2) has a '1', there's exactly one bomb in (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (2,3)\n- But we don't know with certainty which one it is\n\nLooking at the region around (4,4):'1', (4,5):'2', (4,6):'2', (4,7):'1':\n- (4,4) has one bomb adjacent, which could be at (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n- (4,5) has two bombs adjacent...\n\nLet me try a new approach. Let me check if (2,0) is definitely a mine by analyzing the constraints from (1,0):'2' and (3,0):'2':\n- (1,0) sees (0,0), (0,1), (2,0)\n- (3,0) sees (2,0), (2,1), (4,0)\n- Since both need 2 bombs, and they only share adjacency with (2,0), it's likely that (2,0) is a bomb\n\nActually, a clearer approach is to look at the '1' at (0,6) which has only one unexplored adjacent cell at (0,5). This means (0,5) must be a bomb.\n\nActually, I need to check the board again. Looking at (0,6) which shows '1':\n- Adjacent unexplored cells are (0,5), (1,5)\n- One of these must be a bomb\n\nNow I see more precisely:\nAt (0,6):'1':\n- Adjacent unexplored: (0,5)\n- Adjacent already revealed empty: (1,6)\n- Adjacent revealed number: none\n- Adjacent already explored with number: (1,6):'1'\n- Since (0,6) shows '1', the bomb must be at (0,5)\n\nThis is a definite flag we can place at (0,5).\n\nSo my first definite move is to place a flag at (0,5).\n\nMOVE: 0,5,true\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the current board state, I need to find guaranteed safe moves or definite mine locations.\n\nStarting with position (0,6) which shows '1':\n- This means exactly one mine is adjacent to it\n- The only unexplored adjacent cell is at (0,5)\n- Therefore, (0,5) must contain a mine\n\nThis is a definite mine identification where we can safely place a flag without any guessing.\n\nEXPLANATION: The '1' at position (0,6) has only one unexplored adjacent cell at (0,5), so that must be where the mine is located.\nMOVE: 0,5,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 2 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n2 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n3 2 2 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ 1 2 2 1 _ _\n5 _ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n6 _ 1 . . . . . 2 _ _\n7 _ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n8 _ _ _ _ 1 . . 2 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Let's check what's around them.\n- The '2' at (1,0): It needs 2 bombs adjacent. Looking around, there are unexplored tiles at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0).\n- The '2' at (1,1): It needs 2 bombs adjacent. Looking at unexplored tiles around: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (2,1).\n- The '1' at (1,2): It needs 1 bomb adjacent. Looking at unexplored tiles around: (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,2).\n\nRow 2 has a '1' at (2,2). It needs 1 bomb adjacent, looking at unexplored tiles: (1,3), (2,3).\n\nRow 3 has a 2-2-1 pattern again:\n- The '2' at (3,0): Needs 2 bombs adjacent. Unexplored: (2,0), (2,1), (4,0).\n- The '2' at (3,1): Needs 2 bombs adjacent. Unexplored: (2,1), (4,0), (4,1).\n- The '1' at (3,2): Needs 1 bomb adjacent. Unexplored: (2,3), (3,3), (4,2).\n\nLet's continue with other numbered cells and look for constraints.\n\nIn the middle section:\n- (4,4) has a '1': Needs 1 bomb adjacent. Unexplored: (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (5,3).\n- (4,5) has a '2': Needs 2 bombs adjacent. Unexplored: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (5,5).\n- (4,6) has a '2': Needs 2 bombs adjacent. Unexplored: (3,6), (3,7), (5,6).\n- (4,7) has a '1': Needs 1 bomb adjacent. Unexplored: (3,7), (3,8), (4,8), (5,7).\n\nIn row 6:\n- (6,7) has a '2': Needs 2 bombs adjacent. Unexplored: (5,6), (5,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nIn row 8:\n- (8,4) has a '1': Needs 1 bomb adjacent. Unexplored: (7,3), (7,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4).\n- (8,7) has a '2': Needs 2 bombs adjacent. Unexplored: (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7).\n- (8,8) has a '1': Needs 1 bomb adjacent. Unexplored: (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9).\n\nLet me also look at the top right and check what's around the '1' at (0,6) and the F at (0,5).\n- The '1' at (0,6): Needs 1 bomb adjacent. There's already a flag at (0,5) which satisfies this constraint.\n- The '1' at (1,6): Needs 1 bomb adjacent. Unexplored: (0,7), (1,7), (2,6), (2,7).\n\nOk, now that I've analyzed the constraints, let me look for definite moves:\n\n1. The '1' at (0,6) is satisfied by the flag at (0,5), so tiles (0,7), (1,5), and (1,7) should be safe.\n2. The '1' at (1,6) needs one bomb adjacent, which could be at (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), or (2,7). But since (1,5) is already satisfied by the flag at (0,5), (0,7) and (1,7) should be safe.\n\nLet me double-check other constraints to see if there are more logical deductions or conflicts:\n\n- (2,6) is surrounded by '1' tiles at (1,6) and (2,7), suggesting there might be a bomb nearby.\n- (8,6) is adjacent to a '2' at (8,7), which needs 2 bombs around it.\n\nLet me check for any definite bomb locations:\n\nFor the '1' at (1,8): It needs one bomb adjacent. The only unexplored tile is at (2,9).\nSo (2,9) should definitely have a bomb.\n\nFor the '1' at (8,8): It needs one bomb adjacent. Looking at the unexplored tiles: (7,9), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9).\nIt's not immediately clear which one has the bomb.\n\nI need to be very careful with my next move.\n\nWait, let me use the fact that we have 9 flags remaining out of 10 total bombs, and one flag is already placed at (0,5). This means there are 9 more bombs to be found.\n\nI've already identified one definite bomb at (2,9).\n\nLet me take another pass at the board to see if there are any safe squares I can reveal.\n\nOk, I think I can find a safe move at (0,7). \n- The '1' at (0,6) already has a flagged bomb at (0,5).\n- The '1' at (1,6) is adjacent to (0,5), which already has a flag.\n\nSince the '1' at (0,6) indicates only one bomb adjacent, and that's at (0,5), the tile at (0,7) must be safe.\n\nSo my next move is to reveal (0,7), which I'm confident is safe.\n\nActually, wait. I just realized that \"F\" in the board state represents a flag, not a revealed bomb. So there's a flag at (0,5), and a '1' at (0,6).\n\nThe fact that there's a '1' at (0,6) and a flag at (0,5) means that there's exactly one bomb adjacent to (0,6), and it's at (0,5). This means the other adjacent cells to (0,6) - namely (0,7), (1,5), and (1,7) - are safe.\n\nSimilarly, the '1' at (1,6) indicates a single bomb adjacent. Given the flag at (0,5) and the constraints from other numbered cells, the tiles at (0,7), (1,7), and (2,6) should be safe.\n\nLet me double-check: The '1' at (1,6) has unexplored adjacent tiles at (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), and (2,7). The flag at (0,5) is not adjacent to (1,6). So the '1' at (1,6) still indicates one bomb in those unexplored adjacent tiles.\n\nActually, let's be even more careful. The adjacent cells to (1,6) are:\n- (0,5): Flagged\n- (0,6): Revealed as 1\n- (0,7): Unexplored\n- (1,5): Unexplored\n- (1,7): Unexplored\n- (2,5): Unexplored\n- (2,6): Unexplored\n- (2,7): Revealed as 1\n\nSince (1,6) has a value of 1, and (0,5) is already flagged as a bomb, the rest of the adjacent unexplored tiles should be safe.\n\nWait, I've made a mistake in my analysis. Let me be very clear about the coordinate system:\n- (0,0) is the top-left corner\n- (x,y) where x is row and y is column\n\nSo (0,5) is the top row, 6th column, which has an 'F' (flag).\n(0,6) is the top row, 7th column, which has a '1'.\n\nLet me carefully analyze the board again:\n\nThe '1' at (0,6) has these neighbors:\n- (0,5): Flagged\n- (0,7): Unexplored\n- (1,5): Unexplored\n- (1,6): Revealed as 1\n- (1,7): Unexplored\n\nSince the '1' at (0,6) indicates one bomb adjacent, and (0,5) is already flagged, the other adjacent cells ((0,7), (1,5), (1,7)) must be safe.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal (0,7).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the constraints one more time just to be sure:\n\n- '1' at (0,6): Indicates one bomb adjacent. (0,5) is flagged, which satisfies this constraint.\n- '1' at (1,6): Indicates one bomb adjacent. Looking at its neighbors: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7).\n\nActually, (0,5) is not adjacent to (1,6) based on the coordinate system mentioned. Let me draw it out:\n(0,5)(0,6)(0,7)\n(1,5)(1,6)(1,7)\n(2,5)(2,6)(2,7)\n\nSo the neighbors of (1,6) are:\n- (0,5), (0,6), (0,7)\n- (1,5), (1,7)\n- (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n\nAnd for (0,6), the neighbors are:\n- (0,5), (0,7)\n- (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)\n\nLet me make sure I'm looking at the right cells. The '1' at (0,6) (top row, 7th column) has a flag adjacent at (0,5) (top row, 6th column). This satisfies the constraint, so the tiles at (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), and (1,7) should be safe.\n\nBut (1,6) is already revealed as a '1', which means there's one bomb adjacent to it. This bomb could be at (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), or (2,7).\n\nWait, there's a '1' at (1,6)? Let me recheck the board state.\n\nOk, I see now. The board state shows:\n```\n0 _ _ _ _ _ F 1 . . .\n1 2 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n```\n\nSo there's an 'F' at (0,5) and a '1' at (0,6). In row 1, there's a '1' at (1,6).\n\nThe '1' at (0,6) has these neighbors:\n- (0,5): Flagged\n- (0,7): Unexplored\n- (1,5): Unexplored\n- (1,6): Revealed as 1\n- (1,7): Unexplored\n\nThe '1' at (0,6) means there's one bomb adjacent, which is already flagged at (0,5). This means the other adjacent unexplored cells ((0,7), (1,5), (1,7)) must be safe.\n\nThe '1' at (1,6) has these neighbors:\n- (0,5): Flagged\n- (0,6): Revealed as 1\n- (0,7): Unexplored\n- (1,5): Unexplored\n- (1,7): Unexplored\n- (2,5): Unexplored\n- (2,6): Unexplored\n- (2,7): Revealed as 1\n\nThe '1' at (1,6) means there's one bomb adjacent. Since the flag at (0,5) is already accounting for the '1' at (0,6), it means the one bomb adjacent to (1,6) is not at (0,5) and must be at one of the other unexplored adjacent cells: (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), or (2,6).\n\nHold on, actually (2,7) is a '1' not an unexplored tile. Let me recheck.\n\nOk, let's look at the board again for row 2:\n```\n2 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n```\nSo there's a '1' at (2,6) and a '1' at (2,7).\n\nThe '1' at (1,6) has these neighbors:\n- (0,5): Flagged\n- (0,6): Revealed as 1\n- (0,7): Unexplored\n- (1,5): Unexplored\n- (1,7): Unexplored\n- (2,5): Unexplored\n- (2,6): Revealed as 1\n- (2,7): Revealed as 1\n\nGiven the constraints, I can't immediately determine where the bomb adjacent to (1,6) is. It could be at (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), or (2,5).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me recheck the board state carefully.\n\nOk, I see now. The confusion was because I was misinterpreting the coordinates. The correct way to interpret the board is:\n- Rows are indexed from 0 to 9 (top to bottom)\n- Columns are indexed from 0 to 9 (left to right)\n\nLet me look at a different approach.\n\nThere are unexplored tiles that are adjacent to revealed numbers. Let me check if any of these unexplored tiles is definitely a bomb or definitely safe.\n\nOne pattern to look for is when an unexplored tile is adjacent to a revealed number, and all other adjacent unexplored tiles are determined to be safe. In such a case, the unexplored tile must be a bomb.\n\nAnother pattern is when a revealed number has already identified all its adjacent bombs (through flags).

We know one bomb is at (0,5), so there's one more bomb among those 3 unexplored tiles.\n\nRow 1:\n- (1,0) has a 2, with only 1 unexplored adjacent tile at (2,0). This must be a bomb.\n- (1,1) has a 2, satisfied by bombs at (2,0) and (2,1)\n- (1,2) has a 1, satisfied by the bomb at (2,1)\n- The 1 at (1,6) is satisfied by bombs elsewhere\n- (1,8) has a 2, with adjacent unexplored tiles at (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9)\n- (1,9) has a 1, with adjacent unexplored tiles at (0,9), (2,9)\n\nRow 2:\n- The 1 at (2,2) is already satisfied\n- The 1 at (2,6) and (2,7) are already satisfied\n- (2,8) has a 1, with unexplored adjacent tiles at (2,9)\n\nRow 3:\n- (3,0) has a 2, with adjacent unexplored tiles at (4,0)\n- (3,1) has a 2, with adjacent unexplored tiles at (4,0), (4,1)\n- (3,2) has a 1, with adjacent unexplored tiles at (4,2)\n\nRow 4:\n- (4,4) has a 1, with adjacent unexplored tiles at (3,4), (4,3)\n- (4,5) has a 2, with adjacent unexplored tiles at (3,4), (3,5), (4,3)\n- (4,6) has a 2, with adjacent unexplored tiles at (3,5), (3,6)\n- (4,7) has a 1, with adjacent unexplored tiles at (3,6), (3,7)\n\nAnd so on, continuing with the remaining rows...\n\nFrom the analysis above, I can see that (2,0) must be a bomb since it's the only unexplored adjacent tile to (1,0) which has a 2.\n\nLet me check for other definite bombs or safe squares:\n\nLooking at (3,0) which has a 2, we need 2 bombs in adjacent unexplored tiles. The only unexplored adjacent tile is (4,0), so that must be a bomb.\n\nLooking at (1,8) which has a 2, we have 4 adjacent unexplored tiles at (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9). We don't have enough constraints yet to determine which of these are bombs.\n\nLet me look at other sections of the board:\n\nRow 8:\n- (8,4) has a 1\n- (8,7) has a 2, with adjacent unexplored tiles at (7,8), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7)\n- (8,8) has a 1, with adjacent unexplored tiles at (7,8), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n- (8,9) has a 1, with adjacent unexplored tiles at (7,9), (8,9), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nHere's what I've concluded so far:\n- (2,0) must be a bomb (from analyzing (1,0))\n- (4,0) must be a bomb (from analyzing (3,0))\n\nAdditionally, let's look at (3,1) which has a 2. It's adjacent to (4,0) which we determined is a bomb. So there must be one more bomb among the remaining adjacent unexplored tiles, specifically (4,1).\n\nNow, let's decide on the next move:\n\nI've identified two definite bomb locations: (2,0) and (4,0). I could flag either of these.\n\nHowever, I also need to look for safe tiles to reveal. Looking at the 1 at (4,4), it has adjacent unexplored tiles at (3,4) and (4,3). But we don't have enough information to determine which one might contain a bomb.\n\nThe 1 at (3,2) has only (4,2) as an adjacent unexplored tile. I believe (4,2) must be a bomb.\n\nLet me continue searching for definite safe tiles...\n\nLooking at (0,7) which has a 2, we know one bomb is at (0,5) which is flagged. So there must be one more bomb among (0,8), (0,9), and (1,8). But we can't determine which one it is yet.\n\nAfter a thorough analysis, I've identified these definite bomb locations:\n1. (2,0)\n2. (4,0) \n3. (4,1) (from the 2 at (3,1))\n4. (4,2) (from the 1 at (3,2))\n\nI can flag one of these. Let's start with flagging (2,0).\n\nActually, let me double-check this. The 2 at (1,0) means there are 2 bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). We know (2,1) has no bomb since it's a revealed space with value \".\". So the 2 bombs must be among (0,0), (0,1), and (2,0). This doesn't guarantee (2,0) is a bomb.\n\nLet me look at (0,6) which has a 1. The adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). We know (0,5) is flagged as a bomb, and (0,7), (1,6), and (1,7) are revealed numbers. So the 1 bomb is satisfied, meaning (1,5) must be safe.\n\nLooking at (0,7) which has a 2. The adjacent cells are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). We know (0,6) and (1,6) and (1,7) are revealed numbers. So the 2 bombs must be among (0,8), (1,8), and possibly (0,5) which is already flagged. So there's 1 more bomb between (0,8) and (1,8).\n\nLooking at the 2 at (1,8). The adjacent cells are (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). We know (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), and (2,8) are revealed numbers. So the 2 bombs must be among (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), and (2,9).\n\nCombining with the constraint from (0,7), we know there's 1 bomb between (0,8) and (1,8). \n\nActually, wait. Let me double-check the board state:\n\nThe 2 at (1,8) is adjacent to unexplored tiles at (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), and (2,9). We know there are 2 bombs among these.\n\nThe 1 at (1,9) is adjacent to unexplored tiles at (0,9) and (2,9). We know there's 1 bomb between these.\n\nThe 1 at (2,8) is adjacent to (2,9), which means (2,9) is a bomb. \n\nSince (2,9) is a bomb, and there's 1 bomb among (0,9) and (2,9) (from the 1 at (1,9)), it means (0,9) is safe.\n\nAlso, since (2,9) is one of the 2 bombs adjacent to (1,8), the other bomb must be among (0,8), (0,9), and (1,9). But since (0,9) is safe, the other bomb must be either (0,8) or (1,9).\n\nI'll flag (2,9) as a bomb.\n\nActually, let me try a different approach. I'm going to work systematically from the top left, looking for definite moves.\n\nStarting with (1,0) which has a 2: The adjacent unexplored tiles are (0,0), (0,1), and (2,0). We can't determine which of these are bombs with certainty.\n\nLooking at (0,6) which has a 1: The adjacent tiles are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is flagged as a bomb, and (0,7), (1,6), and (1,7) are revealed numbers. So the bomb count is satisfied, meaning (1,5) must be safe.\n\nI will reveal (1,5) as it's definitely safe.\n</think>\nLooking carefully at the board, I need to find a definite safe move or a square that must contain a bomb.\n\nI'll check the number 1 at (0,6). It has these adjacent cells:\n- (0,5): Flagged as a bomb\n- (0,7), (1,6), (1,7): Already revealed as numbers\n- (1,5): Still unexplored\n\nSince the 1 at (0,6) indicates exactly one adjacent bomb, and we already have a flag at (0,5), the cell at (1,5) must be safe. The number 1 is already satisfied by the flagged bomb, so there can't be another bomb adjacent to it.\n\nEXPLANATION: The cell at (1,5) must be safe because the 1 at (0,6) already has its single adjacent bomb accounted for with the flag at (0,5).\nMOVE: 1,5,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ F 1 2 . .\n1 2 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n2 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n3 2 2 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ 1 2 2 1 _ _\n5 _ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n6 _ 1 . . . . . 2 _ _\n7 _ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n8 _ _ _ _ 1 . . 2 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Then (0,7) would need a bomb at either (0,8) or (0,9).\n\nI don't see a definitive conclusion from this yet.\n\nLet me look for any 1's that have all but one cell revealed around them, which would give me a safe move:\n\nAt (0,6) with value '1':\n- It already has 1 flagged neighbor at (0,5)\n- Therefore, neighbors at (0,7), (0,8), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) must be safe\n- But those are already revealed, so no new information here\n\nLet me look at the middle section more carefully:\n\nIn the region around (4,4) to (4,7), there's a pattern of 1's and 2's, but without more revealed cells, it's hard to make definitive deductions.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Let's look for places where we can definitely reveal a cell:\n\nNear position (1,2) with value '1':\n- Unexplored neighbors: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3)\n- It has already 1 bomb accounted for (somewhere among already revealed neighbors), so these positions should be safe\n- Actually, we don't know where that 1 bomb is yet, so we can't say these are safe\n\nNear position (3,2) with value '1':\n- Unexplored neighbors: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n- Same issue as above\n\nI need to find more constrained positions where I can make a definitive move.\n\nActually, let me recheck the top-left corner:\n- At (1,0) with value '2', the unexplored neighbors are (0,0), (0,1)\n- At (1,1) with value '2', the unexplored neighbors are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,3)\n- At (1,2) with value '1', the unexplored neighbors are (0,2), (0,3), (1,3)\n\nIf we consider these together:\n- If (1,0) has bombs at (0,0) and (0,1), that would satisfy it\n- Then (1,1) already has 2 bombs accounted for at (0,0) and (0,1), so (0,2) and (1,3) would be safe\n- And if (0,2) is safe, then (1,2)'s bomb must be at (0,3) or (1,3)\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if I'm interpreting the board correctly. Let me double-check my understanding:\n- '_' means an empty revealed space (no bomb, no number)\n- '.' means an unexplored space\n- 'F' means a flagged space\n\nWith this understanding, let me reconsider positions:\n\nAh, I see. At (0,6) there is a '1', which means one adjacent bomb. We have a flag at (0,5), which accounts for this bomb. That means all other adjacent positions to (0,6) must be safe. These would include (0,8) (if not already revealed).\n\nAt (0,7) there is a '2', meaning 2 adjacent bombs. We know one is at (0,5), so there must be one more bomb adjacent. This could be at (0,8), (1,7), or (1,8). But (1,7) is already revealed as '1', so it's not a bomb. So the bomb must be at either (0,8) or (1,8).\n\nBut there's a challenge here. (1,8) is already revealed as '2', meaning it has 2 adjacent bombs. This doesn't immediately tell us if (0,8) is a bomb or not.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Looking at the bottom right:\n- At (8,8) with value '1', adjacent unexplored spaces are at (7,9), (8,9), (9,8), (9,9)\n- At (8,7) with value '2', adjacent unexplored spaces are at (7,8), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8)\n\nI don't see an immediate deduction here either.\n\nLet me try one more approach. Let me check if there are any revealed numbers that have exactly the right number of unexplored adjacent cells as the number itself, which would indicate all those unexplored cells are bombs:\n\nFor instance, if there's a '3' with exactly 3 unexplored adjacent cells, all 3 must be bombs.\n\nLooking through the board, I don't immediately see such a pattern.\n\nAt this point, I might need to make a probabilistic assessment of the safest move. Since we have 9 flags remaining and 10 bombs total, we've only found 1 bomb so far.\n\nGiven the constraints and what we know so far, one reasonably safe move might be to reveal (0,0):\n- It's adjacent to (1,0) which has a '2', but there are other unexplored cells around (1,0) where the bombs could be\n- It's in a corner, so it has fewer adjacent cells (only 3) than a central position, reducing the chance of a bomb\n\nSo my move is to reveal position (0,0).\n\nActually, let me double-check if we can get more information from the board. \n\nI'm checking positions around (1,3), (2,3), and (3,3):\n- (1,2) has a '1', with (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) unexplored\n- (2,2) has a '1', with (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) unexplored\n- (3,2) has a '1', with (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) unexplored\n\nIf these '1's represent different bombs, that would mean 3 bombs among these positions. But that seems unlikely because they overlap.\n\nIt's possible that (1,3) is a bomb (satisfying (1,2)), and (4,3) is a bomb (satisfying (3,2)), and perhaps (2,3) or (3,3) is a bomb (satisfying (2,2)).\n\nBut I can't make a definitive conclusion.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I think revealing (0,0) is still a reasonable move.\n\nActually, you know what, I'm going to be more careful and double-check. If (0,7) has a value of '2', and we already have a flag at (0,5), there must be one more bomb around (0,7). The only unexplored positions around (0,7) are (0,8) and (1,8).\n\nBut (1,8) is already revealed as '2', not unexplored. So the bomb must be at (0,8).\n\nWait, checking the board again, (1,8) IS revealed as '2'. This means it has 2 bombs adjacent to it. The adjacent unexplored cells are (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), and (2,9).\n\nIf (0,8) is a bomb (which we deduced from the '2' at (0,7)), then (1,8) must have one more bomb among (0,9), (1,9), and (2,9).\n\nSo, I've deduced that (0,8) is a bomb, and I should flag it.\n\nMOVE: 0,8,true\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the board carefully, I need to find a safe move or identify a definite bomb location.\n\nFirst, let me analyze position (0,7) which has a value of \"2\":\n- It has one adjacent bomb already flagged at (0,5)\n- This means there must be exactly one more bomb adjacent to it\n- The only unexplored adjacent cells are at (0,8) and (0,9)\n\nNow, checking position (1,8) which has a value of \"2\":\n- It also needs exactly two bombs adjacent to it\n- Its unexplored adjacent cells are (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), and (2,9)\n\nIf we consider these constraints together:\n- Position (0,7) must have exactly one more bomb adjacent to it\n- This bomb must be either at (0,8) or (0,9)\n- If we place this bomb at (0,8), it also helps satisfy the constraint for (1,8)\n\nTherefore, I can confidently conclude that (0,8) contains a bomb and should be flagged.\n\nEXPLANATION: Position (0,7) has value \"2\" with one bomb already flagged at (0,5), so there must be another bomb adjacent.

Let's check the constraints on the other cells:\n- Cell (2,8) is revealed as 1, so it's not a bomb.\n- Cell (2,7) is revealed as 1, so it's not a bomb.\n\nThis leaves (0,9), (1,9), and (2,9) as possibilities for the remaining bomb adjacent to (1,8).\n\nLet me check if there are other constraints:\n- The 1 at (1,9) needs one bomb adjacent.

The 2 at (1,8) needs another bomb adjacent (besides the flagged one at (0,8)), but the 1 at (1,9) suggests there shouldn't be any more bombs adjacent to it beyond the one at (0,8).\n\nLet me double-check my understanding of the board:\n- The 2 at (1,8) means 2 bombs adjacent\n- The 1 at (1,9) means 1 bomb adjacent\n- There's a flag at (0,8)\n\nActually, I think I misunderstood the symbols. Let me clarify:\n- _ : Empty revealed space (no adjacent bombs)\n- . : Unexplored space (could be a bomb or a number)\n- F : Flagged space (marked as a bomb)\n- 1-8: Number indicating adjacent bombs\n\nSo (1,7) is unexplored (shown as .), not revealed as empty.\n\nLet me reanalyze:\n- The 2 at (1,8) has one flagged bomb at (0,8). It needs one more adjacent bomb.\n- The 1 at (1,9) also has the flagged bomb at (0,8). It shouldn't have any more adjacent bombs.\n\nThis means the remaining bomb adjacent to (1,8) must be at a cell that is not adjacent to (1,9). The cells adjacent to (1,8) but not to (1,9) would be: (2,7).\n\nActually, no, (2,7) is adjacent to both (1,8) and (1,9). Let me redraw the local area to understand better:\n\n```\n    7 8 9\n0   2 F .\n1   . 2 1\n2   1 1 ?\n```\n\nThe 2 at (1,8) has these adjacent cells: (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\nThe 1 at (1,9) has these adjacent cells: (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the board, we see the cell at (2,9) is unexplored (_), which means it has no adjacent bombs. \n\nLet me double-check the board legend again:\n- _ : Empty revealed space\n- . : Unexplored space\n- F : Flagged space\n- * : Revealed bomb (game over)\n- 1-8: Number indicating adjacent bombs\n\nSo, \"_\" means an empty revealed space (no adjacent bombs), not unexplored. Sorry for the confusion.\n\nAlright, with this clarification:\n- Cell (2,9) is unexplored (_), not revealed as empty.\n- The remaining bomb adjacent to (1,8) could be at (0,9), (1,7), (2,7), or (2,9).\n- Because of the 1 at (1,9), the bomb can't be at (0,9) or (2,9).\n- This leaves (1,7) or (2,7) as possibilities.\n\nLet's check other constraints:\n- The 1 at (0,6) already has a flag at (0,5), so all other adjacent cells should be safe.\n- The 1 at (2,7) has no flags nearby yet, so it needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nThis is starting to form a pattern. The 1 at (2,7) needs one bomb adjacent, and it's adjacent to both (1,7) and (2,6). If we know which one is the bomb, we can make progress.\n\nLooking at the 2 at (6,7), it has many unexplored adjacent cells, so it's hard to make a definitive deduction there.\n\nLet's go back to the top area and check the constraints:\n- The 1 at (0,6) has a flag at (0,5). All other adjacent cells should be safe.\n- I can safely reveal (1,5), (1,6).\n\nI think I'll make a move to reveal (1,5).\n\nActually, I noticed a clearer constraint in the top right. Let's double check it:\n\nThe 1 at (0,6) already has a flag at (0,5), so all other adjacent cells (including (1,5)) should be safe. This includes (1,5).\n\nLet me identify this move:\nMOVE: 1,5,false\n\nLet's double check by verifying adjacent revealed numbers:\n- (0,6) has a 1, with a flag at (0,5). This is consistent.\n- (1,6) has a 1, but I don't see any flags adjacent to it yet.\n\nSo I'm confident that (1,5) is safe to reveal.\n\nBut actually, let me check if there are any more definitive bomb locations that should be flagged first.\n\nLet's look at the bottom right:\n- The 2 at (8,7) has one flag adjacent to it, so it needs one more bomb. Adjacent unexplored cells are (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7).\n- The 1 at (8,8) also provides constraints.\n\nWait, I don't see any flags adjacent to (8,7). Let me check again... \n\nAh, I realize I've been interpreting the board incorrectly. Let me double-check the board state:\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ F 1 2 F .\n1 2 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n2 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n3 2 2 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ 1 2 2 1 _ _\n5 _ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n6 _ 1 . . . . . 2 _ _\n7 _ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n8 _ _ _ _ 1 . . 2 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n```\n\nOk, so flags are explicitly marked with F, and I don't see any flags in the bottom right area. \n\nSo the 2 at (8,7) needs 2 bombs in its vicinity, and the 1 at (8,8) needs 1 bomb.\n\nLet me look systematically row by row for safe moves or bomb locations.\n\nActually, I think a safe move is to reveal (3,5). Looking around it:\n- The 1 at (2,2) is adjacent to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Given the revealed board, it seems like the bomb for this 1 is in the top left corner.\n- The 1s at (4,4), (5,4) also have bombs to their left or top-left.\n\nActually, I notice something interesting at the top right. The 2 at (0,7) has one flag at (0,8). It needs one more bomb in its vicinity. The 2 at (1,8) also has one flag at (0,8) and needs one more bomb. These two 2s overlap in their vicinity only at (1,7). So (1,7) must be a bomb!\n\nLet me double-check this:\n- The 2 at (0,7) is adjacent to: (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8).\n- We know (0,6) is 1, (0,8) is F, and (1,6) is 1, so they're not bombs. (1,8) is 2, so it's not a bomb. This leaves (1,7) as the only possibility for the second bomb adjacent to (0,7).\n- Similarly, for the 2 at (1,8), it's adjacent to: (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9).\n- We know (0,7) is 2, (0,8) is F, (1,9) is 1, (2,7) is 1, (2,8) is 1, so they're not bombs. (0,9) and (2,9) are unexplored, but if one of them were a bomb, it would contradict the 1 at (1,9). This again leaves (1,7) as the only possibility for the second bomb adjacent to (1,8).\n\nSo, I'm confident that (1,7) is a bomb, and I should flag it.\n\nMOVE: 1,7,true\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the board, I can identify a clear bomb location in the top-right section.\n\nThe key insight comes from analyzing two \"2\" tiles at positions (0,7) and (1,8):\n- The \"2\" at position (0,7) needs exactly two bombs adjacent to it\n- It already has one bomb flagged at (0,8)\n- It needs one more bomb among its adjacent cells\n\nSimilarly:\n- The \"2\" at position (1,8) also needs two bombs adjacent to it\n- It also already has one bomb flagged at (0,8)\n- It needs one more bomb adjacent to it\n\nWhen I check the overlapping adjacent cells of both these \"2\" tiles, I find that (1,7) is the only unexplored cell that's adjacent to both. This means (1,7) must contain a bomb to satisfy both constraints simultaneously.\n\nEXPLANATION: Cell (1,7) must be a bomb because it's the only cell that can satisfy both the \"2\" at (0,7) and the \"2\" at (1,8), as they both already have one adjacent flag at (0,8).\nMOVE: 1,7,true", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ F 1 2 F .\n1 2 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . 2 1\n2 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n3 2 2 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ 1 2 2 1 _ _\n5 _ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n6 _ 1 . . . . . 2 _ _\n7 _ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n8 _ _ _ _ 1 . . 2 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 9, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, I'm playing Minesweeper on a 10x10 board with 10 bombs total. 3 bombs have already been flagged, leaving 7 flags remaining. Let me carefully analyze the board to determine a safe move.\n\nFirst, let me check all revealed numbers against existing flags:\n\nFor numbers with adjacent flags:\n- (0,6) has a 1 with one adjacent flag at (0,8), which is consistent.\n- (0,7) has a 2 with one adjacent flag at (0,8), but needs one more bomb adjacent.\n- (1,0) has a 2 with no adjacent flags visible in the current state.\n- (1,1) has a 2 with no adjacent flags visible.\n- (1,2) has a 1 with no adjacent flags visible.\n- (1,6) has a 1 with one adjacent flag at (1,7), which is consistent.\n- (1,8) has a 2 with one adjacent flag at (0,8), but needs one more bomb adjacent.\n- (1,9) has a 1 with one adjacent flag at (1,7), which is consistent.\n\nLet me continue checking other numbers and look for obvious next moves.\n\nAreas where we can make definite deductions:\n1. Looking at (0,7) with value 2 - it has one flag at (0,8) but needs one more bomb. The only other unexplored cell adjacent to it is (0,9), so that must be a bomb!\n\n2. Looking at (1,8) with value 2 - it has one flag at (0,8) but needs one more bomb. It touches unexplored cells at (0,9), (2,9), (2,8), so one of those must be a bomb.\n\nHmm, let me think about the constraints more carefully.\n\nFrom position (0,7) with value 2:\n- It has flagged neighbor at (0,8)\n- Unexplored neighbors at (0,9), (1,9) \n- But (1,9) has value 1 and its bomb is accounted for with flag at (1,7)\n- This means (0,9) must be a bomb!\n\nFrom position (1,8) with value 2:\n- It has flagged neighbor at (1,7)\n- Unexplored neighbors at (0,9), (2,9), (2,8)\n- From our previous deduction, (0,9) is a bomb\n- This satisfies the \"2\" at (1,8), so (2,9) and (2,8) should be safe\n\nThere's also something interesting in the bottom right:\n- Position (8,7) has value 2\n- Position (8,8) has value 1\n- Position (8,9) is unexplored\n\nWait, I need to be more careful about the coordinates. Let me check the board again with the right coordinate system, where the first number is the row (vertical) and the second is the column (horizontal).\n\nLooking at row 0, column 7 (value 2):\n- It has a flag at (0,8)\n- Unexplored cell at (0,9)\n- It also has a revealed 1 at (1,6) and a flag at (1,7)\n- Based on this, the cell at (0,9) must be a bomb.\n\nActually, I need to be more systematic. Let's analyze each number and its neighboring cells:\n\nFor cell (0,7) with value 2:\n- Neighboring cells: (0,6), (0,8), (0,9), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)\n- We have a flag at (0,8) and (1,7)\n- That's 2 flags already, which matches the number, so all other neighbors are safe\n- That means (0,9) is safe!\n\nFor cell (1,8) with value 2:\n- Neighboring cells: (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n- We have flags at (0,8) and (1,7)\n- That's 2 flags, which matches the number, so all other neighbors are safe\n- That means (0,9), (2,7), (2,8), and (2,9) are safe!\n\nLooking at row 2, column 1 (value 1):\n- Surrounding: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n- We see numbers 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1\n- All surrounding cells are already revealed, and it's consistent\n\nLet me look at other areas of the board:\n\nIn the middle-right:\n- Position (4,6) has value 2\n- Position (4,7) has value 1\n- Position (5,7) has value 1\n- Position (6,7) has value 2\n- Position (7,7) has value 1\n- Position (8,7) has value 2\n\nThis looks like a useful pattern. Let me analyze cell (8,7) with value 2:\n- Neighbors: (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8)\n- We have values at (7,7)=1, (8,8)=1\n- Unexplored cells are (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8)\n- We need 2 bombs in these 5 cells\n\nCell (8,8) with value 1:\n- Neighbors: (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n- We have values at (7,7)=1, (8,7)=2\n- Unexplored cells are (7,9), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)\n- We need 1 bomb in these 5 cells\n\nSince (9,7) and (9,8) are unexplored neighbors of both (8,7) and (8,8), I can make a deduction:\n- (8,7) needs 2 bombs total adjacent\n- (8,8) needs 1 bomb total adjacent\n- If we consider the cells (9,7), (9,8) which are common to both, we need at most 1 bomb in these two cells\n\nLet's continue analyzing other parts of the board.\n\nIn the top-left area, I notice:\n- Cell (1,2) has value 1, and all its neighbors are revealed. Consistent.\n- Cell (2,2) has value 1, and touches unexplored cells at (2,3). This means (2,3) might be a bomb.\n- Cell (3,2) has value 1, and touches unexplored cells at (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). One of these must be a bomb.\n\nIn the middle-left:\n- Cell (4,4) has value 1, touching unexplored cells at (3,3), (3,4), (4,3). One of these must be a bomb.\n- Cell (5,4) has value 1, touching unexplored cells at (4,3), (5,3). One of these must be a bomb.\n\nI'm looking for a definite move where I can either:\n1. Flag a cell that must be a bomb\n2. Reveal a cell that must be safe\n\nFrom my analysis, one safe move I can identify:\n- Looking at (0,7) with value 2: It has flags at (0,8) and (0,5), which accounts for its 2 bombs. Therefore, (0,9) is safe.\n\nLet me double-check this. Position (0,7) with value 2:\n- It has neighboring cells (0,6)=1, (0,8)=F, (0,9), (1,6)=1, (1,7)=F, (1,8)=F\n- It has flags at (0,8) and (1,7)\n- There's a third flag at (1,8), but that's not adjacent to (0,7)\n- Since it has exactly 2 adjacent flags, all other neighbors must be safe\n\nSo I can safely reveal the cell at (0,9).\n\nActually, I see a different possibility. The flagged cells are at (0,5), (0,8), and (1,7). Let me verify this before making my decision.\n\nFrom the board:\nBOARD STATE:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ F 1 2 F .\n1 2 2 1 _ _ _ 1 F 2 1\n2 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n3 2 2 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ 1 2 2 1 _ _\n5 _ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n6 _ 1 . . . . . 2 _ _\n7 _ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n8 _ _ _ _ 1 . . 2 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n\nFlags are at (0,5), (0,8), and (1,7).\n\nLooking at cell (0,7) with value 2:\n- Neighbors: (0,6), (0,8), (0,9), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)\n- We have flags at (0,8) and (1,7)\n- That's exactly 2 flags, matching the value of the cell\n- Therefore, all other neighbors must be safe, including (0,9)\n\nThis confirms my decision to reveal (0,9).\n\nFor the move format, I need to provide coordinates x,y,flag, where:\n- x is the row (0-indexed)\n- y is the column (0-indexed)\n- flag is true/false (true = place flag, false = reveal tile)\n\nSo my move is: 0,9,false\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLet me carefully analyze the board to find a safe move.\n\n## Looking at cell (0,7) with value 2:\nThis cell tells us there are exactly 2 bombs adjacent to it.

We need to check adjacent cells to see if we can determine bomb locations.\n\nI need to analyze more systematically to find safe moves or definite flags.\n\nLet's check each revealed number and see if we can deduce any safe squares or definite bombs:\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- (0,6): Value 1, satisfied by flag at (0,5). So (0,4), (0,7), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) are safe.\n- (0,7): Value 2, satisfied by flags at (0,8) and (1,7). So (0,6), (1,6), (1,8), (2,7), and (2,8) are safe.\n\nRow 1:\n- (1,0): Value 2. Not enough information yet.\n- (1,1): Value 2. Not enough information yet.\n- (1,2): Value 1. Not enough information yet.\n- (1,6): Value 1, satisfied by flag at (1,7). So (0,5), (0,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) are safe.\n- (1,8): Value 2, satisfied by flags at (0,8) and (1,7). So (0,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9) are safe.\n- (1,9): Value 1.

We need to determine where the adjacent bomb is.\n\nI need to look for patterns or contradictions to identify safe moves.\n\nLet's check if the positions we marked as \"safe\" based on satisfied numbers are indeed unrevealed. If they are, we can reveal them.\n\nPosition (1,5) is unrevealed and should be safe based on the analysis above. Let's reveal it.\n\nActually, I need to double-check this.

At (0,6), there's a '1' with an adjacent flag at (0,5). This means all other cells around (0,6) must be safe.\n2. Similarly, at (1,6), there's a '1' with an adjacent flag at (1,7). This means all other cells around (1,6) must be safe.\n\nThis creates an overlapping area of confirmed safety around position (1,5), which is currently unexplored.\n\nBy revealing (1,5), we'll likely get more information about the central area of the board, which will help us make more progress.\n\nEXPLANATION: Position (1,5) is adjacent to two revealed numbers that both have their bomb requirements satisfied by existing flags. The '1' at (0,6) has a flag at (0,5), and the '1' at (1,6) has a flag at (1,7). Therefore, (1,5) must be safe to reveal.\n\nMOVE: 1,5,false", "flags_remaining": 7, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ F 1 2 F 1\n1 2 2 1 _ _ _ 1 F 2 1\n2 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n3 2 2 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ 1 2 2 1 _ _\n5 _ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n6 _ 1 . . . . . 2 _ _\n7 _ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 _ _\n8 _ _ _ _ 1 . . 2 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": true}
