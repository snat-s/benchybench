{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current state of the board. From what I can see, the board is completely unexplored except for some dots which I assume are unexplored spaces. All the squares are either '.' or '_' but since the board is 10x10 and all are '.' in the provided state, I think it's a completely new game. \n\nThe game info says there are 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining. So, the goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs. Since the board is entirely unexplored, my first thought is that I should start by revealing a square to get some information. \n\nLooking at the rules, I remember that numbers indicate how many bombs are in the adjacent 8 squares. So, if I reveal a square and it's a number, that gives me clues about where the bombs might be. If it's a '.', then I know that square is safe, and I can explore its neighbors more confidently.\n\nI also need to consider the critical flag placement rules. Since I haven't placed any flags yet, I don't have to worry about conflicting flags. But as I start revealing squares, I'll have to make sure that any flags I place don't contradict the numbers I've uncovered.\n\nSince the board is empty, my best move is probably to reveal a square to get started. The classic strategy in Minesweeper is to start in the middle, but since all squares are the same, maybe I can choose a corner or somewhere in the center. Let's say I choose (5,5) just to have a central point. Alternatively, sometimes people start at (0,0) because it's a corner, but that might not be as informative as a central square.\n\nWait, but in the initial move, sometimes starting in the middle gives more information because it has more adjacent squares. So maybe (5,5) is a good first move. However, since all squares are unexplored, any square is as good as another. Maybe I'll just pick (0,0) for simplicity.\n\nBut wait, if I reveal (0,0) and it's a 0, that's great because I can reveal all adjacent squares without worrying about bombs. If it's a 1, then I know there's exactly one bomb around it. If it's higher, that gives me more info. Alternatively, if it's a bomb, the game ends, but since I have 10 bombs, the chance is low, but it's still a risk. \n\nHmm, maybe it's better to start in a corner because corners have fewer adjacent squares, so if it's a number, it's easier to manage. Let me think: (0,0) has only three adjacent squares: (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). If I reveal (0,0) and it's a 1, then I know there's one bomb in those three squares. That could be a good starting point.\n\nAlternatively, if I reveal a square and it's a 0, I can reveal all the surrounding squares without any issues. That might be safer and give me more information quickly. But again, the chance of hitting a bomb is there, but with only 10 bombs on a 100-square board, the probability is low.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided any revealed squares yet, so maybe I'm looking at a different state. Let me check again. Oh, the board state shows all '.' which means all are unexplored. So, I need to make the first move.\n\nIn that case, the best approach is to reveal a square. Since all are the same, I'll pick a central square to maximize the information I get. Let's choose (5,5) as my first move. So, I'll reveal that square without placing a flag.\n\nSo, the move would be x=5, y=5, flag=false. That way, I can see what's there and plan my next moves accordingly. If it's a number, I can start deducing where the bombs are. If it's a 0, I can reveal more squares around it safely.\n\nI think that's the best approach for the first move. I don't want to place a flag yet because I don't have any information to base it on. Revealing a square will give me the necessary data to proceed.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: I chose to reveal the square at (5,5) to gain initial information about the board, as it's a central location that can provide insights into surrounding areas.\n\nMOVE: 5,5,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
