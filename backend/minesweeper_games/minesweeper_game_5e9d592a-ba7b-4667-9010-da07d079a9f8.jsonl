Corner moves are particularly good starting points in Minesweeper because they have fewer adjacent tiles (only 3 adjacent squares instead of 8), which reduces the initial risk.\n\nThe top-left corner (0,0) is a classic starting move, as it gives us the most information while minimizing risk, and helps establish a pattern for further exploration.\n\nEXPLANATION: Starting with the top-left corner (0,0) as it has only 3 adjacent tiles, minimizing our initial risk.
