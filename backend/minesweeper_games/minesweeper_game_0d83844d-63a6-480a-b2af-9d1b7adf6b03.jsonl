The only unexplored cell adjacent to (0,1) is (0,2).\n\n**Conclusion:** (0,2) is likely a bomb.\n\n#### **Cell (1,1): Number `1`**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- (0,0): `_` (Empty)\n- (0,1): `1` (Number)\n- (0,2): `.` (Unexplored) [Potential bomb]\n- (1,0): `_` (Empty)\n- (1,2): `1` (Number)\n- (2,0): `_` (Empty)\n- (2,1): `_` (Empty)\n- (2,2): `1` (Number)\n\nGiven that (0,2) is suspected to be a bomb, and (1,1) shows `1`, this aligns correctly as there's exactly one bomb adjacent.\n\n#### **Cell (1,2): Number `1`**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- (0,1): `1` (Number)\n- (0,2): `.` (Unexplored) [Potential bomb]\n- (0,3): `.` (Unexplored)\n- (1,1): `1` (Number)\n- (1,3): `.` (Unexplored)\n- (2,1): `_` (Empty)\n- (2,2): `1` (Number)\n- (2,3): `.` (Unexplored)\n\nAssuming (0,2) is a bomb, this satisfies the `1` in (1,2), meaning no other adjacent unexplored cells should contain bombs.\n\n#### **Cell (2,2): Number `1`**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- (1,1): `1` (Number)\n- (1,2): `1` (Number)\n- (1,3): `.` (Unexplored)\n- (2,1): `_` (Empty)\n- (2,3): `.` (Unexplored)\n- (3,1): `_` (Empty)\n- (3,2): `1` (Number)\n- (3,3): `.` (Unexplored)\n\nAssuming (0,2) is a bomb, which is adjacent to (1,1) and (1,2), but not directly to (2,2).

Therefore, (5,3) needs one bomb in its adjacent unexplored cells: (4,4), (5,4), or (6,4).\n\n#### **Cell (6,3): Number `1`**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- (5,2): `_` (Empty)\n- (5,3): `1` (Number)\n- (5,4): `.` (Unexplored)\n- (6,2): `_` (Empty)\n- (6,4): `.` (Unexplored)\n- (7,2): `_` (Empty)\n- (7,3): `1` (Number)\n- (7,4): `1` (Number)\n\nAssuming (5,3) needs a bomb in (4,4), (5,4), or (6,4), let's look at (6,3). If (6,4) were a bomb, it would satisfy both (6,3) and (7,4), but (7,4) has a `1`, which is already satisfied by (6,4).\n\n#### **Cell (7,3): Number `1`**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- (6,2): `_` (Empty)\n- (6,3): `1` (Number)\n- (6,4): `.` (Unexplored)\n- (7,2): `_` (Empty)\n- (7,4): `1` (Number)\n- (8,2): `_` (Empty)\n- (8,3): `_` (Empty)\n- (8,4): `1` (Number)\n\nAssuming (6,4) is a bomb, it satisfies (7,3), meaning no other adjacent unexplored cells should contain bombs.\n\n#### **Cell (7,4): Number `1`**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- (6,3): `1` (Number)\n- (6,4): `.` (Unexplored) [Potential bomb]\n- (6,5): `.` (Unexplored)\n- (7,3): `1` (Number)\n- (7,5): `.` (Unexplored)\n- (8,3): `_` (Empty)\n- (8,4): `1` (Number)\n- (8,5): `.` (Unexplored)\n\nAssuming (6,4) is a bomb, it satisfies (7,4), meaning no other adjacent unexplored cells should contain bombs.\n\n#### **Cell (8,4): Number `1`**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- (7,3): `1` (Number)\n- (7,4): `1` (Number)\n- (7,5): `.` (Unexplored)\n- (8,3): `_` (Empty)\n- (8,5): `.` (Unexplored)\n- (9,3): `_` (Empty)\n- (9,4): `1` (Number)\n- (9,5): `.` (Unexplored)\n\nAssuming (6,4) is a bomb, it doesn't directly affect (8,4). Therefore, (8,4) needs one bomb in its adjacent unexplored cells: (7,5), (8,5), or (9,5).\n\n#### **Cell (9,4): Number `1`**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- (8,3): `_` (Empty)\n- (8,4): `1` (Number)\n- (8,5): `.` (Unexplored)\n- (9,3): `_` (Empty)\n- (9,5): `.` (Unexplored)\n\nAssuming (8,4) needs a bomb in (7,5), (8,5), or (9,5), let's look at (9,4). If (9,5) were a bomb, it would satisfy (9,4).\n\n### **Flagging Potential Bombs**\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following cells are likely bombs:\n- (0,2)\n- (3,3)\n- (6,4)\n- (9,5)\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that flagging these cells doesn't conflict with any revealed numbers.\n\n#### **Validating Flag Placements**\n\n1. **Flagging (0,2):**\n   - Adjacent to (0,1) and (1,1), both showing `1`. Since (0,2) is the only unexplored cell adjacent to (0,1), flagging it is consistent.\n\n2. **Flagging (3,3):**\n   - Adjacent to (2,2), (3,2), and (4,3). (3,2) shows `1`, which is satisfied by (3,3). (4,3) shows `1`, also satisfied by (3,3).\n\n3. **Flagging (6,4):**\n   - Adjacent to (5,3), (6,3), and (7,4). (5,3) shows `1`, satisfied by (6,4). (7,4) shows `1`, also satisfied by (6,4).\n\n4. **Flagging (9,5):**\n   - Adjacent to (8,4) and (9,4). (8,4) shows `1`, satisfied by (9,5). (9,4) shows `1`, also satisfied by (9,5).\n\nAll flag placements are consistent with the revealed numbers.\n\n### **Determining the Next Move**\n\nGiven that we've identified four potential bomb locations and have sufficient flags remaining (10 flags available, 10 bombs total), it's logical to proceed by flagging these cells.\n\nHowever, for strategic purposes, we should prioritize flagging cells that provide the most information or reduce uncertainty in adjacent areas.\n\nLooking at the flagged cells:\n- (0,2) affects (0,1) and (1,1).\n- (3,3) affects multiple cells in rows 2 to 4.\n- (6,4) affects cells in rows 5 to 7.\n- (9,5) affects cells in rows 8 and 9.\n\nFlagging (3,3) and (6,4) would cover a wider area, potentially revealing more safe cells.\n\n**Decision:** Start by flagging (3,3).\n\n### **Final Move**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the analysis, cell (3,3) is identified as a bomb due to its adjacency to multiple numbered cells that require exactly one bomb in their vicinity. Flagging this cell is consistent with the revealed numbers and helps in further deducing safe moves.\n\n**MOVE:** 3,3,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n2 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n4 _ _ 1 1 . . . . . .\n5 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n6 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n7 _ _ _ 1 1 . . . . .\n8 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Therefore, we need to determine if there's a bomb adjacent to (5,3).\n\n10. **Position (6,3):** Revealed as `1`.\n    - Adjacent positions: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n    - (5,3) is revealed as `1`.\n    - No flags are adjacent.\n\n11. **Position (7,3):** Revealed as `1`.\n    - Adjacent positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)\n    - (6,3) is revealed as `1`.\n    - No flags are adjacent.\n\n12. **Position (7,4):** Revealed as `1`.\n    - Adjacent positions: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)\n    - (6,3) is revealed as `1`.\n    - No flags are adjacent.\n\n13. **Position (8,4):** Revealed as `1`.\n    - Adjacent positions: (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n    - (7,4) is revealed as `1`.\n    - No flags are adjacent.\n\n14. **Position (9,4):** Revealed as `1`.\n    - Adjacent positions: (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,3), (9,5)\n    - (8,4) is revealed as `1`.\n    - No flags are adjacent.\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves\n\nNow, let's look for squares that can be safely revealed based on the current information.\n\n1. **Position (2,1):** Unexplored (`_`).\n   - Adjacent to (1,1) and (2,2).\n   - (1,1) is revealed as `1`, and there's a flag at (3,3) which is not adjacent to (2,1).\n   - Since (1,1) shows `1` and there are no adjacent bombs (no flags), (2,1) must be safe.\n\n2. **Position (1,0):** Unexplored (`_`).\n   - Adjacent to (0,0) and (0,1).\n   - (0,1) is revealed as `1`, and there are no adjacent flags.\n   - Since (0,1) shows `1` and there are no adjacent bombs, (1,0) must be safe.\n\n3. **Position (0,0):** Unexplored (`_`).\n   - Adjacent to (0,1) and (1,0).\n   - (0,1) is revealed as `1`, and there are no adjacent flags.\n   - Since (0,1) shows `1` and there are no adjacent bombs, (0,0) must be safe.\n\n4. **Position (3,1):** Unexplored (`_`).\n   - Adjacent to (2,1), (3,2), and (4,1).\n   - (3,2) is revealed as `1`, and there's a flag at (3,3) which is not adjacent to (3,1).\n   - Since (3,2) shows `1` and there are no adjacent bombs, (3,1) must be safe.\n\n5. **Position (4,1):** Unexplored (`_`).\n   - Adjacent to (3,1), (4,2), and (5,1).\n   - (4,2) is revealed as `1`, and there are no adjacent flags.\n   - Since (4,2) shows `1` and there are no adjacent bombs, (4,1) must be safe.\n\n6. **Position (5,1):** Unexplored (`_`).\n   - Adjacent to (4,1), (5,2), and (6,1).\n   - (5,3) is revealed as `1`, but it's not adjacent to (5,1).\n   - Since there are no revealed numbers directly adjacent to (5,1), it's less certain, but given the overall pattern, it's likely safe.\n\n7. **Position (6,1):** Unexplored (`_`).\n   - Adjacent to (5,1), (6,2), and (7,1).\n   - (6,3) is revealed as `1`, but it's not adjacent to (6,1).\n   - Similar to (5,1), it's likely safe.\n\n8. **Position (7,1):** Unexplored (`_`).\n   - Adjacent to (6,1), (7,2), and (8,1).\n   - (7,3) is revealed as `1`, but it's not adjacent to (7,1).\n   - Likely safe.\n\n9. **Position (8,1):** Unexplored (`_`).\n   - Adjacent to (7,1), (8,2), and (9,1).\n   - (8,4) is revealed as `1`, but it's not adjacent to (8,1).\n   - Likely safe.\n\n### Verifying the Flag Placement\n\nThere's one flag placed at (3,3). Let's verify if this flag is correctly placed.\n\n1. **Position (3,3):** Flagged as `F`.\n   - Adjacent squares: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n   - (2,2) is revealed as `1`, (3,2) is revealed as `1`, and (4,2) is revealed as `1`.\n   - Each of these `1`s indicates that there is exactly one bomb adjacent to them.\n   - Given that (3,3) is flagged, it accounts for the bomb adjacent to (2,2), (3,2), and (4,2).\n   - This seems consistent because each of these `1`s only has one adjacent flagged bomb.\n\n### Deciding the Next Move\n\nBased on the analysis, several unexplored squares are likely safe to reveal. To proceed cautiously, I'll choose the safest move\u2014a square that is almost certainly safe based on the current information.\n\n**Position (0,0):** This square is adjacent to (0,1), which is revealed as `1` with no adjacent bombs. Therefore, (0,0) must be safe.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Position (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1), which shows `1` with no adjacent bombs. Therefore, (0,0) is safe to reveal.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 _ 1 1 . . . . . . .\n2 _ _ 1 . . . . . . .\n3 _ _ 1 F . . . . . .\n4 _ _ 1 1 . . . . . .\n5 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n6 _ _ _ 1 . . . . . .\n7 _ _ _ 1 1 . . . . .\n8 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n9 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .", "sucess": true}

These are likely bombs.\n   - The number '1' at (0,1) has one adjacent flag at (0,0). Since (0,0) is a flag, there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (0,1).\n   - The number '1' at (1,1) has one adjacent flag at (0,0). Therefore, there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (1,1).\n   - The number '1' at (1,2) has no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent.\n   - The number '1' at (2,2) has one adjacent flag at (2,3). Therefore, there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (2,2).\n   - The number '1' at (3,2) has one adjacent flag at (3,3). Therefore, there cannot be another bomb adjacent to (3,2).\n   - The number '1' at (4,2) and (4,3) have no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to each.\n   - The number '1' at (5,3) has no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent.\n   - The number '1' at (6,3) has no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent.\n   - The number '1' at (7,3) and (7,4) have no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent to each.\n   - The number '1' at (8,4) has no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent.\n   - The number '1' at (9,4) has no adjacent flags, so there must be exactly one bomb adjacent.\n\n2. **Identify safe moves:**\n   - At (0,2), (0,3), and (0,4), these are unexplored and adjacent to (0,1). Since (0,1) already has one adjacent flag at (0,0), these squares must be safe. Therefore, we can reveal them.\n   - At (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), these are unexplored and adjacent to (1,2). Since (1,2) has no adjacent flags, one of these must be a bomb, but we cannot determine which one yet. Therefore, we should not reveal them.\n\n3. **Identify bomb placements:**\n   - At (1,2), there must be exactly one bomb adjacent. The possible adjacent squares are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,1) is already flagged, and (2,3) is flagged.
