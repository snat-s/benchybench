Row 9\n\n- **(9,2) = 1**: This tile has 1 adjacent bomb.\n\n### Starting with the Lowest Numbers\n\nIt's often easier to start with tiles that have the lowest numbers, as they have fewer possible bomb placements.\n\n#### 1. Tile (3,3) = 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n- (3,2), (3,4)\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nCurrently, all adjacent squares are unexplored (`.`). Since this tile indicates exactly one bomb adjacent, we need to determine which of these adjacent squares is the bomb.\n\nHowever, without additional information, we cannot definitively place a flag here yet.\n\n#### 2. Tile (4,0) = 1\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (3,-1), invalid (out of bounds)\n- (3,0), (3,1)\n- (4,-1), invalid\n- (4,1)\n- (5,-1), invalid\n- (5,0), (5,1)\n\nValid adjacent squares: (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1)\n\nAll are unexplored.

No flags can be placed yet.\n\n### Looking for Definite Bombs\n\nSince none of the '1' tiles allow us to place a flag directly, let's look at higher-numbered tiles to see if we can identify any bombs.\n\n#### 1. Tile (3,4) = 3\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n- (3,3), (3,5)\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nLet's check which of these are unexplored:\n\n- (2,3): `.`\n- (2,4): `.`\n- (2,5): `.`\n- (3,3): `1` (already revealed)\n- (3,5): `2` (already revealed)\n- (4,3): `_` (empty revealed space)\n- (4,4): `2` (already revealed)\n- (4,5): `.`\n\nSo, the unexplored adjacent squares are: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (4,5)\n\nThis tile indicates there are 3 bombs adjacent. Let's see if we can deduce any bomb locations.\n\nLooking at (3,3) = 1, which is adjacent to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), etc. If (2,3) or (2,4) were bombs, that would affect both (3,3) and (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) = 2 is adjacent to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), etc.\n\nLet's see if we can find a consistent placement.\n\nSuppose (2,3) is a bomb:\n- Then (3,3) = 1 would be satisfied.\n- (3,4) = 3 would still need two more bombs among (2,4), (2,5), (4,5).\n\nBut if (2,4) is also a bomb:\n- (3,3) = 1 would still be satisfied (only (2,3) is a bomb).\n- (3,4) = 3 would have two bombs so far ((2,3) and (2,4)).\n- We'd need one more bomb among (2,5) and (4,5).\n\nBut if (2,4) is a bomb, it would also affect (3,5) = 2.\n\nLet's check (3,5) = 2:\n\nAdjacent squares:\n- (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n- (3,4), (3,6)\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nPossible bomb locations: (2,4), (2,5), (4,5)\n\nIf (2,4) is a bomb, then we need one more bomb among (2,5) and (4,5).\n\nLet's assume (2,5) is also a bomb:\n- Then (3,5) = 2 would have two bombs ((2,4) and (2,5)), which satisfies it.\n- (3,4) = 3 would have three bombs ((2,3), (2,4), (2,5)), which also satisfies it.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, we can place flags at (2,3), (2,4), and (2,5).\n\n#### Verifying with Other Tiles\n\nLet's ensure this doesn't conflict with other tiles.\n\n- **(3,2) = 2**:\n  Adjacent squares: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n  \n  Currently, (2,3) is a bomb, so we need one more bomb among the rest.\n\n  Let's look at (4,1) = 1:\n  Adjacent squares: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)\n  \n  If (2,3) is a bomb, which is adjacent to (3,2) = 2, and (3,3) = 1, then (3,2) needs one more bomb among the adjacent squares.\n\n  Let's consider (2,2) as a bomb:\n  - Then (3,2) = 2 would have two bombs ((2,2) and (2,3)), which satisfies it.\n  \n  Now, let's check (4,1) = 1:\n  Adjacent squares: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)\n  \n  If (2,2) is a bomb, it's adjacent to (3,2), but (3,2) is already satisfied with two bombs.\n  \n  So, (4,1) = 1 needs one bomb among its adjacent squares. Let's look at (3,1):\n  If (3,1) is a bomb, it would satisfy (4,1) = 1.\n\n  Now, let's check (3,1) = ?:\n  Wait, (3,1) is not revealed yet. But if we place a bomb at (3,1), we need to ensure it doesn't conflict with other tiles.\n\n  Let's proceed and see.\n\n#### Placing Flags Based on Deductions\n\nBased on the above, we can place the following flags:\n\n1. **(2,3)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n2. **(2,4)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n3. **(2,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n4. **(2,2)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n5. **(3,1)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n\nHowever, we have only 10 bombs in total, and we've already flagged 5. Let's ensure this doesn't exceed the total number of bombs.\n\nWait, we need to be careful. Let's re-examine our deductions.\n\n#### Re-evaluating Flag Placements\n\nUpon closer examination, placing a flag at (2,2) might not be necessary. Let's see:\n\nWe have:\n\n- (2,3): Bomb\n- (2,4): Bomb\n- (2,5): Bomb\n\nThis satisfies (3,4) = 3 and (3,5) = 2.\n\nNow, for (3,2) = 2, it's adjacent to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), etc.\n\nWe already have (2,3) as a bomb, so we need one more bomb among (2,1), (2,2), etc.\n\nLet's consider (2,2) as a bomb:\n\n- Then (3,2) = 2 would have two bombs ((2,2) and (2,3)), which satisfies it.\n\nNow, let's check (4,1) = 1:\n\nAdjacent squares: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)\n\nIf (2,2) is a bomb, it's adjacent to (3,2), but (3,2) is already satisfied.\n\nSo, (4,1) = 1 needs one bomb among its adjacent squares.\n\nLet's look at (3,1):\n\nIf (3,1) is a bomb:\n\n- It satisfies (4,1) = 1.\n\nNow, let's check if placing a bomb at (3,1) affects other tiles.\n\nLooking at (3,1):\n\nAdjacent squares: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nIf (3,1) is a bomb, we need to ensure it doesn't conflict with other tiles.\n\nLet's check (3,0):\n\nNot revealed yet. So, no conflict.\n\nLet's check (4,1):\n\nAlready satisfied with the bomb at (3,1).\n\nSo, placing a bomb at (3,1) seems safe.\n\nTherefore, our flag placements are:\n\n1. **(2,3)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n2. **(2,4)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n3. **(2,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n4. **(2,2)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n5. **(3,1)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n\nThis uses 5 flags, leaving us with 5 more bombs to flag.\n\n#### Looking for Additional Definite Bombs\n\nLet's see if we can find other definite bomb placements.\n\n#### 1. Tile (3,5) = 2\n\nAdjacent squares: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nWe've already flagged (2,4) and (2,5) as bombs, which satisfies (3,5) = 2.\n\nSo, no additional bombs adjacent to (3,5).\n\n#### 2. Tile (4,4) = 2\n\nAdjacent squares: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nCurrently, (3,4) is next to (2,4) and (2,5), which we've already flagged.\n\nBut (4,4) = 2 needs two bombs adjacent.\n\nLooking at the adjacent squares:\n\n- (3,3) = 1\n- (3,4) = 3 (already has three bombs adjacent)\n- (3,5) = 2 (already has two bombs)\n- (4,3) = `_` (empty)\n- (4,5) = `.` (unexplored)\n- (5,3) = `.` (unexplored)\n- (5,4) = `2` (already revealed)\n- (5,5) = `.` (unexplored)\n\nSo, unexplored adjacent squares: (4,5), (5,3), (5,5)\n\nWe need two bombs among these three squares.\n\nLet's see if we can deduce any.\n\nLooking at (5,4) = 2:\n\nAdjacent squares: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nCurrently, (4,4) = 2 is adjacent to (5,4).\n\nIf (4,5) is a bomb:\n\n- It would satisfy one bomb for (4,4) = 2.\n- We'd need one more bomb among (5,3) and (5,5).\n\nLet's assume (5,5) is a bomb.\n\nThen, (5,4) = 2 would have two bombs adjacent ((4,5) and (5,5)), which satisfies it.\n\nNow, let's check (6,4) = 1:\n\nAdjacent squares: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)\n\nIf (5,5) is a bomb, it's adjacent to (6,4), satisfying (6,4) = 1.\n\nTherefore, we can place flags at:\n\n6. **(4,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n7. **(5,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n\nNow, let's tally our flags:\n\n1. **(2,3)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n2. **(2,4)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n3. **(2,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n4. **(2,2)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n5. **(3,1)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n6. **(4,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n7. **(5,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n\nThis uses 7 flags, leaving us with 3 more bombs to flag.\n\n#### Checking for Additional Bombs\n\nLet's look for other tiles that might require bomb placements.\n\n#### 1. Tile (5,4) = 2\n\nWe've already flagged (4,5) and (5,5) as bombs, which satisfies (5,4) = 2.\n\n#### 2. Tile (6,4) = 1\n\nWe've flagged (5,5) as a bomb, which is adjacent to (6,4), satisfying (6,4) = 1.\n\n#### 3. Tile (7,2) = 1\n\nAdjacent squares: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)\n\nAll adjacent squares are unexplored.\n\nSince (7,2) = 1, there must be one bomb adjacent.\n\nLet's consider (6,3):\n\nIf (6,3) is a bomb, it would satisfy (7,2) = 1.\n\nLet's check if this conflicts with other tiles.\n\nLooking at (6,4) = 1:\n\nIt's satisfied by (5,5) already.\n\nLooking at (7,3) = 1:\n\nAdjacent squares: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)\n\nIf (6,3) is a bomb, it would be adjacent to (7,3), satisfying it.\n\nTherefore, we can place a flag at:\n\n8. **(6,3)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n\nNow, our flags are:\n\n1. **(2,3)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n2. **(2,4)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n3. **(2,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n4. **(2,2)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n5. **(3,1)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n6. **(4,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n7. **(5,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n8. **(6,3)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n\nThis uses 8 flags, leaving us with 2 more bombs to flag.\n\n#### 4. Tile (7,3) = 1\n\nWe've flagged (6,3) as a bomb, which is adjacent to (7,3), satisfying (7,3) = 1.\n\n#### 5. Tile (7,4) = 1\n\nAdjacent squares: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)\n\nWe've flagged (6,3) and (6,5) is unexplored.\n\nSince (7,4) = 1 and (6,3) is already a bomb, there cannot be another bomb adjacent.\n\nTherefore, (6,5) is safe.\n\n#### 6. Tile (8,2) = 1\n\nAdjacent squares: (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3)\n\nWe've flagged (6,3) as a bomb, which is adjacent to (7,3), satisfying (7,3) = 1.\n\nNow, (8,2) = 1 needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nLet's consider (7,2):\n\nIf (7,2) is a bomb, it would satisfy (8,2) = 1.\n\nLet's check if this conflicts with other tiles.\n\nLooking at (7,2) = 1:\n\nIt would now have a bomb at (7,2), but (7,2) = 1 expects only one bomb adjacent.\n\nIf (7,2) is a bomb, it would mean there's no other bomb adjacent to (7,2), which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we can place a flag at:\n\n9. **(7,2)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n\nNow, our flags are:\n\n1. **(2,3)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n2. **(2,4)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n3. **(2,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n4. **(2,2)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n5. **(3,1)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n6. **(4,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n7. **(5,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n8. **(6,3)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n9. **(7,2)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n\nThis uses 9 flags, leaving us with 1 more bomb to flag.\n\n#### 7. Tile (8,3) = ?\n\nAdjacent squares: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n\nWe've flagged (7,2) and (6,3) as bombs.\n\nLooking at (8,3):\n\nAdjacent squares: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n\nWe've flagged (7,2) as a bomb.\n\nLet's check if (8,3) requires a bomb.\n\nWait, (8,3) is unexplored. We cannot determine if it's a bomb yet.\n\n#### 8. Tile (9,2) = 1\n\nAdjacent squares: (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3)\n\nWe've flagged (7,2) as a bomb, which is adjacent to (8,2).\n\nNow, (9,2) = 1 needs one bomb adjacent.\n\nLet's consider (8,2):\n\nIf (8,2) is a bomb, it would satisfy (9,2) = 1.\n\nLet's check if this conflicts with other tiles.\n\nLooking at (8,2):\n\nAdjacent squares: (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3)\n\nWe've flagged (7,2) as a bomb, so (8,2) would have one bomb adjacent, satisfying (8,2) = 1 if it's a bomb.\n\nHowever, (8,2) is unexplored. If we flag it as a bomb, we need to ensure it doesn't conflict.\n\nLooking at (8,2):\n\nIf (8,2) is a bomb, it would satisfy (9,2) = 1 and (8,2) itself.\n\nTherefore, we can place the final flag at:\n\n10. **(8,2)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n\nNow, all 10 bombs have been flagged.\n\n### Final Flag Placements\n\nHere are all the flagged bombs:\n\n1. **(2,3)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n2. **(2,4)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n3. **(2,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n4. **(2,2)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n5. **(3,1)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n6. **(4,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n7. **(5,5)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n8. **(6,3)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n9. **(7,2)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n10. **(8,2)**: Flagged as a bomb.\n\n### Next Move: Revealing a Safe Square\n\nWith all bombs flagged, the remaining unexplored squares are safe to reveal.

Since (3,4) is already accounted for, (5,4) and (5,5) must be bombs.\n\n3. **Flag Placement**:\n   - Place flags at (2,4) and (4,5) since they must be bombs.\n\n### MOVE: 2,4,true\n### MOVE: 4,5,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n2 1 1 .

Since we've flagged (2,3) as a bomb, this satisfies the adjacent bomb count for both (1,2) and (2,2). Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells to (1,2) and (2,2) should be safe.\n\n- **Flag at (4,5):**\n  - Adjacent cells:\n    - (3,4): `3`\n    - (3,5): `2`\n    - (4,4): `2`\n  \n  This flag at (4,5) needs to be analyzed in the context of the numbers around it.\n\n### 3. **Analyzing the Number at (3,4): `3`**\n\nLet's examine the number `3` at (3,4). It has the following adjacent cells:\n\n```\n(2,3): F\n(2,4): .\n(3,3): 1\n(3,5): 2\n(4,3): 1\n(4,4): 2\n(4,5): F\n```\n\nWe know that (2,3) and (4,5) are flagged. That accounts for 2 bombs. Since the number is `3`, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (3,4).\n\nLooking at the unexplored adjacent cells:\n\n- (2,4): `.`\n  \nSo, (2,4) must be a bomb. Therefore, we should flag (2,4).\n\n### 4. **Analyzing the Number at (3,5): `2`**\n\nNext, let's look at the number `2` at (3,5). Its adjacent cells are:\n\n```\n(2,4): .\n(2,5): .\n(3,4): 3\n(4,4): 2\n(4,5): F\n```\n\nWe've already flagged (4,5), accounting for one bomb. Therefore, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (3,5). Looking at the unexplored cells:\n\n- (2,4): `.`\n- (2,5): `.`\n  \nFrom the previous analysis, we've deduced that (2,4) is a bomb. Therefore, (2,5) should be safe.\n\n### 5. **Analyzing the Number at (4,4): `2`**\n\nNow, let's examine the number `2` at (4,4). Its adjacent cells are:\n\n```\n(3,3): 1\n(3,4): 3\n(3,5): 2\n(4,3): 1\n(4,5): F\n(5,3): _\n(5,4): _\n(5,5): _\n```\n\nWe've flagged (4,5), accounting for one bomb. Therefore, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (4,4). Looking at the unexplored cells:\n\n- (5,3): `_` (revealed empty)\n- (5,4): `_` (revealed empty)\n- (5,5): `_` (revealed empty)\n  \nAll adjacent cells are revealed and empty, which contradicts the number `2`. This suggests a possible error in our previous flag placements or deductions.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Flag at (4,5):**\n\nPerhaps our assumption that (4,5) is a bomb is incorrect. Let's reassess.\n\n### 6. **Reassessing the Flag at (4,5):**\n\nIf (4,5) is not a bomb, then the number `2` at (4,4) needs two bombs adjacent. Let's look at its adjacent cells again:\n\n```\n(3,3): 1\n(3,4): 3\n(3,5): 2\n(4,3): 1\n(4,5): F\n(5,3): _\n(5,4): _\n(5,5): _\n```\n\nWithout (4,5) being a bomb, we need two bombs among:\n\n- (3,3): `1`\n  - Already has one adjacent bomb (likely (2,3)).\n  \nWait, this seems inconsistent. It's clear that our initial flag placement at (4,5) might be incorrect. Therefore, we should remove the flag at (4,5) and reassess.\n\n### 7. **Removing the Flag at (4,5):**\n\nSince the flag at (4,5) causes a contradiction with the number `2` at (4,4), we should remove it.\n\n**Move:**\n```\nMOVE: 4,5,true (remove the flag)\n```\n\nAfter removing the flag at (4,5), we need to re-analyze the adjacent numbers.\n\n### 8. **Re-analyzing the Number at (4,4): `2`**\n\nWith (4,5) unflagged, the number `2` at (4,4) needs two bombs adjacent. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n```\n(3,3): 1\n(3,4): 3\n(3,5): 2\n(4,3): 1\n(4,5): .\n(5,3): _\n(5,4): _\n(5,5): _\n```\n\nWe need to determine where these two bombs are.\n\n**Analyzing (3,3): `1`**\n\nAdjacent cells to (3,3):\n\n```\n(2,2): 1\n(2,3): F\n(3,2): .\n(3,4): 3\n(4,2): .\n(4,3): 1\n```\n\nWe have a flag at (2,3), which satisfies the bomb count for (3,3). Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells to (3,3) should be safe.\n\n**Analyzing (3,4): `3`**\n\nAdjacent cells to (3,4):\n\n```\n(2,3): F\n(2,4): .\n(3,3): 1\n(3,5): 2\n(4,3): 1\n(4,4): 2\n(4,5): .\n```\n\nWe have a flag at (2,3). Therefore, there must be two more bombs adjacent to (3,4). Looking at the unexplored cells:\n\n- (2,4): `.`\n- (4,5): `.`\n  \nBoth (2,4) and (4,5) must be bombs to satisfy the number `3` at (3,4). Therefore, we should flag both (2,4) and (4,5).\n\n### 9. **Flagging (2,4) and (4,5):**\n\nBased on the above analysis, we need to flag (2,4) and (4,5).\n\n**Move:**\n```\nMOVE: 2,4,true (place flag)\nMOVE: 4,5,true (place flag)\n```\n\n### 10. **Verifying the Flag Placements:**\n\nLet's ensure that these flag placements do not create any conflicts.\n\n**Flag at (2,4):**\n\nAdjacent numbers:\n\n- (1,3): `.`\n- (1,4): `.`\n- (2,3): `F`\n- (2,5): `.`\n- (3,3): `1`\n- (3,4): `3`\n- (3,5): `2`\n\nThe number `1` at (3,3) is already satisfied by the flag at (2,3). The number `3` at (3,4) now has flags at (2,3) and (2,4), which accounts for two bombs. It needs one more bomb adjacent, which we've identified as (4,5).\n\n**Flag at (4,5):**\n\nAdjacent numbers:\n\n- (3,4): `3`\n- (3,5): `2`\n- (4,4): `2`\n  \nThe number `3` at (3,4) now has flags at (2,4) and (4,5), satisfying its bomb count. The number `2` at (4,4) has flags at (4,5) and (2,4), which also satisfies its bomb count.\n\n### 11. **Identifying Safe Moves:**\n\nNow that we've correctly flagged the bombs, we can identify safe moves by revealing unexplored cells that are adjacent to numbers already satisfied by flags.\n\n**Analyzing (2,5):**\n\nAdjacent numbers:\n\n- (1,4): `.`\n- (1,5): `.`\n- (2,4): `F`\n- (3,4): `3`\n  \nThe number `3` at (3,4) is already satisfied by flags at (2,3), (2,4), and (4,5). Therefore, (2,5) should be safe to reveal.\n\n**Analyzing (1,3) and (1,4):**\n\nAdjacent numbers:\n\n- (0,2): `1`\n- (0,3): `.`\n- (0,4): `.`\n- (1,2): `1`\n- (1,3): `.`\n- (1,4): `.`\n- (2,2): `1`\n- (2,3): `F`\n- (2,4): `F`\n  \nThe number `1` at (1,2) is adjacent to (0,2), (1,3), and (2,2). We have a flag at (2,3), which is adjacent to (1,2) and (2,2). Therefore, (1,3) should be safe to reveal.\n\n**Analyzing (3,5):**\n\nAdjacent numbers:\n\n- (2,4): `F`\n- (2,5): `.`\n- (3,4): `3`\n- (3,6): `.`\n- (4,4): `2`\n- (4,5): `F`\n  \nThe number `2` at (3,5) is adjacent to flags at (2,4) and (4,5), satisfying its bomb count. Therefore, (3,6) should be safe to reveal.\n\n### 12. **Making the Safe Moves:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can safely reveal the following cells:\n\n- (2,5)\n- (1,3)\n- (3,6)\n\n**Move:**\n```\nMOVE: 2,5,false (reveal)\nMOVE: 1,3,false (reveal)\nMOVE: 3,6,false (reveal)\n```\n\n### 13. **Final Verification:**\n\nAfter making these moves, we should verify that all numbers are correctly satisfied by the adjacent flags and that there are no contradictions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- **Number `1` at (0,1):**\n  - Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n  - (1,1) is `1`, which is adjacent to (0,1). Since (1,1) is `1`, and we've revealed (1,3) as safe, there are no adjacent bombs, which contradicts the number `1`. This indicates a possible error in our previous moves.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Number at (0,1): `1`**\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n```\n(0,0): _\n(0,2): 1\n(1,0): _\n(1,1): 1\n(1,2): 1\n```\n\nWe need to determine where the bomb adjacent to (0,1) is. Since (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1) are all `_` or `1`, none of them can be bombs. Therefore, the bomb must be at (0,2) or (1,2).\n\nHowever, both (0,2) and (1,2) are `1`, meaning they each have one adjacent bomb. This suggests that our previous flag placements might still be incorrect.\n\n### 14. **Identifying the Mistake:**\n\nUpon closer inspection, our initial assumption that (2,4) and (4,5) are bombs might not be accurate. Let's re-examine the number `3` at (3,4):\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n```\n(2,3): F\n(2,4): F\n(3,3): 1\n(3,5): 2\n(4,3): 1\n(4,4): 2\n(4,5): F\n```\n\nIf (2,3), (2,4), and (4,5) are all flagged, that's three bombs adjacent to (3,4), which matches the number `3`. However, this causes a contradiction with the number `1` at (0,1).\n\nTherefore, our initial flag placement at (2,4) might be incorrect. Let's remove the flag at (2,4).\n\n### 15. **Removing the Flag at (2,4):**\n\n**Move:**\n```\nMOVE: 2,4,true (remove flag)\n```\n\n### 16. **Re-analyzing the Number at (3,4): `3`**\n\nWith (2,4) unflagged, the number `3` at (3,4) needs three bombs adjacent. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n```\n(2,3): F\n(2,4): .\n(3,3): 1\n(3,5): 2\n(4,3): 1\n(4,4): 2\n(4,5): F\n```\n\nWe have flags at (2,3) and (4,5), accounting for two bombs. Therefore, there must be one more bomb adjacent to (3,4). Looking at the unexplored cells:\n\n- (2,4): `.`\n  \nSo, (2,4) must be a bomb. Therefore, we should flag (2,4).\n\n**Move:**\n```\nMOVE: 2,4,true (place flag)\n```\n\n### 17. **Final Verification:**\n\nNow, let's verify all numbers:\n\n- **Number `1` at (0,1):**\n  - Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n  - (1,1) is `1`, which is adjacent to (0,1). Since (1,1) is `1`, and we've flagged (2,3) as a bomb adjacent to (1,1), (0,1) should have one bomb adjacent, which is satisfied if (0,2) or (1,2) is a bomb.\n\nHowever, both (0,2) and (1,2) are `1`, indicating they each have one adjacent bomb. This suggests that our flag placements are still causing inconsistencies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter multiple iterations, it's clear that there's a complex interaction between the flagged cells and the numbered cells. To resolve this, we need to consider the possibility that some of our initial assumptions are incorrect and that some unflagged cells must also be bombs to satisfy all the numbers.\n\nGiven the complexity, the safest move at this point is to reveal a cell that is least likely to be a bomb based on the current information.\n\n**Final Move:**\n\nGiven that (2,5) is adjacent to the number `2` at (3,5), which already has two adjacent flags (assuming (2,4) and (4,5) are flagged), (2,5) should be safe to reveal.\n\n**Move:**\n```\nMOVE: 2,5,false (reveal)\n```\n\nThis move minimizes the risk of hitting a bomb and allows us to gather more information to make informed decisions in the next steps.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```\nEXPLANATION: After carefully analyzing the board, I determined that revealing cell (2,5) is the safest move as it is adjacent to a number already satisfied by existing flags, minimizing the risk of hitting a bomb.\nMOVE: 2,5,false\n```", "flags_remaining": 8, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n2 1 1 .
