Corners are often good starting points because they have fewer adjacent tiles, reducing the risk of triggering a bomb.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Let's analyze the current state of the board step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Check all revealed numbers against existing flags\n- There are no flags currently placed on the board, so we don't need to check for conflicts.\n\n### Step 2: Look for obvious conflicts\nSince there are no flags, there are no conflicts to resolve.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the remaining number of flags vs bombs\nWe have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs to flag.\n\n### Step 4: Identify safe moves or flag placements\nLet's look for tiles that must contain bombs based on the numbers revealed.\n\n- **Tile (7,1) has a '3'**: This tile indicates that there are 3 bombs in the adjacent 8 squares. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), and (8,2). Given that there are 3 bombs in these 8 tiles, we can start to deduce where they might be.\n\n- **Tile (8,2) has a '1'**: This tile indicates that there is 1 bomb in the adjacent 8 squares. The adjacent unexplored tiles are (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), and (9,3). Since tile (7,1) already has a '3', it's likely that at least one bomb is adjacent to it.\n\n### Step 5: Decide on the next move\nGiven the above analysis, the safest move is to reveal a tile that is least likely to contain a bomb. Let's look at tile (6,0):\n\n- **Tile (6,0)** is unexplored and adjacent to tile (7,1) which has a '3'. Revealing this tile will give us more information about the possible locations of the bombs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nEXPLANATION: Revealing tile (6,0) is a safe move that will provide more information about the adjacent bombs, especially in relation to tile (7,1) which has a '3'.\nMOVE: 6,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . .\n3 1 1 _ _ _ 2 . . . .\n4 . 1 _ _ _ 2 . . . .\n5 . 2 _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n6 . 1 _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n7 . 3 1 _ _ 1 . . . .\n8 . . 1 _ _ 1 2 . . .\n9 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 . . .", "sucess": false}
