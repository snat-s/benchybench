The board is currently completely unexplored, meaning I haven't revealed any squares yet.\n\nFor the first move in Minesweeper, it's generally safest to select a random tile, ideally near the middle of the board, as this maximizes the chances of revealing a large area. The corners and edges of the board tend to have less adjacent squares, so revealing them gives less information.\n\nLet me choose a square near the middle of the board:\n- I'll choose (4,4), which is near the center.\n\nMy move would be:\nEXPLANATION: Starting with a center position to maximize information gained from first move.\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nThis indicates I want to reveal the tile at position (4,4), not place a flag there.\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Move Analysis\n\nI'm looking at a completely unexplored 10x10 board with 10 bombs. Since this is my first move, I'll follow standard Minesweeper strategy.\n\n## Strategy for First Move\nWhen starting a new game, the best approach is to click near the center of the board:\n- Center positions are more likely to open up larger safe areas\n- Corner/edge positions have fewer adjacent cells, providing less information\n- The first click in many Minesweeper implementations is guaranteed to be safe\n\nEXPLANATION: Making my first move near the center of the board, which maximizes the chance of revealing a large open area and provides the most information for subsequent moves.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
