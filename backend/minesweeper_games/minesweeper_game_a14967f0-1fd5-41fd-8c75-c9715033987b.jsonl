{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm just starting out with this Minesweeper game. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs to find. I have 10 flags left, which matches the number of bombs, so I need to place them correctly.\n\nLooking at the board, everything is unexplored. All the squares are dots, meaning I haven't revealed anything yet. Since I'm a bit new, I should probably start by revealing some squares to get some numbers, which will help me figure out where the bombs are.\n\nI remember that in Minesweeper, the best strategy is to start in a corner because if you hit a bomb there, it's less likely to be surrounded by other bombs. So, I'll start by revealing the top-left corner, which is position (0,0). \n\nWhen I reveal (0,0), if it's a number, it'll tell me how many bombs are adjacent. If it's a bomb, the game ends, but that's a risk I have to take. Since I don't have any flags placed yet, I can't rely on any existing information. So, revealing (0,0) is the logical first step.\n\nI don't see any immediate conflicts or flags to worry about because the board is completely unexplored. So, my move is to reveal (0,0). Let's see what happens next.\n</think>\n\nI'm starting the game by revealing the top-left corner to gather initial information.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
