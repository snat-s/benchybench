Also, the '1' at (1,1) has a flag at (0,2), this also satisfies the '1'. Looking at (4,3), we see a '1' and have determined the flag at (0,2) is satisfied.

Given there are no flags adjacent to the '1', and it has one adjacent explored empty space, there's no definite place for a bomb, so we cannot flag it. However, if (0,2) were a bomb, then (0,1)'s count would be satisfied. Considering the '1' at (3,2), it has an adjacent 1, and the empty space (4,3) is surrounded by the 1s on the grid. Since there can be a maximum of 1 bomb around this '1', and there are 1s, we can't place a flag to determine if this space is a bomb. Examining the '2' at (5,2), the adjacent unexplored spaces are (4,3) and (6,3). If both were bombs, that would satisfy the '2's bomb count, but it is more complicated. However, let's focus on the 'F' flag at (6,2). Consider the '2' at (6,4). It is touching the flag at (6,2) and one other unexplored space at (7,3). Given this, it might be a good idea to try flagging the unexplored space. Let's examine the '2' at (5,2). It needs to have two bombs. It borders the space (6,3), which we just said is touching (6,4)'s adjacent 2. This might be another good place to flag.\n\nMOVE: 7,3,true", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1 2 1\n4 _ _ 1 . 1 _ 1 . . .\n5 _ _ 2 . 2 _ 1 . . .\n6 _ _ F . 2 1 1 . . .\n7 _ _ 1 1 2 . . . . .\n8 _ _ _ _ 1 2 . . . .\n9 _ _ _ _ _ 1 . . . .", "sucess": true}
