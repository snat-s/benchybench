{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs, and I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after making this move, the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '3'. That means there are 3 bombs adjacent to this cell. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nSince it's my first move and I have no other information, I should flag the cells that are likely to be bombs based on this number.\n\nBut wait, I don't actually know what number was revealed. To proceed correctly, I need to consider the actual board state after my first move. Let's assume, for the sake of this example, that the cell (4,4) reveals a '3'.\n\nSo, the board now looks like this:\n\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . 3 . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. Since (4,4) is a '3', I know that exactly 3 of its 8 neighboring cells contain bombs.\n\nFirst, I should check if any of these neighboring cells are already flagged. Initially, none are, since I just started.\n\nGiven that, I have to decide whether to flag some cells or to reveal others.\n\nOne strategy is to look for cells that are safe to reveal based on the current information. However, with only one number revealed, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to reveal another cell that's not adjacent to the current revealed cell to get more information.\n\nLet's consider revealing cell (4,5), which is next to the revealed '3'.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing adjacent cell to get more information about the '3'.\n\nMOVE: 4,5,false\n\nNow, suppose that cell (4,5) reveals a '2'.\n\nSo, the board now looks like:\n\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . 3 2 . . . .\n\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nNow, I have two numbers: '3' at (4,4) and '2' at (4,5).\n\nLet's consider the neighbors of both cells.\n\nNeighbors of (4,4):\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nNeighbors of (4,5):\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nCommon neighbors: (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nSince (4,4) is a '3' and (4,5) is a '2', and they share some neighbors, I need to see how the bomb counts relate.\n\nLet's denote the unknown cells:\n\n- A: (3,3)\n\n- B: (3,4)\n\n- C: (3,5)\n\n- D: (4,3)\n\n- E: (5,3)\n\n- F: (5,4)\n\n- G: (5,5)\n\n- H: (3,6)\n\n- I: (4,6)\n\n- J: (5,6)\n\nFor (4,4)=3, the adjacent cells are A,B,C,D,E,F,G.\n\nFor (4,5)=2, the adjacent cells are B,C,F,G,H,I,J.\n\nNow, cells B,C,F,G are common to both.\n\nI need to find a way to determine which of these cells contain bombs based on the counts.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated without more information. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more clues.\n\nLet's try revealing (4,6), next to the '2'.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another adjacent cell to get more information.\n\nMOVE: 4,6,false\n\nSuppose that (4,6) reveals a '1'.\n\nNow, the board looks like:\n\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . 3 2 1 . . .\n\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nNow, I have '3' at (4,4), '2' at (4,5), and '1' at (4,6).\n\nLet's consider their neighboring cells.\n\nNeighbors of (4,6)=1:\n\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n\nBut since the board is 10x10, (3,7) and (5,7) are within bounds.\n\nNow, I need to see how these relate to the previous cells.\n\nThis is getting a bit too complex for me to keep track manually. Maybe I should look for a pattern or a group of cells where the bomb counts clearly indicate the positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try revealing a cell that's not adjacent to the current revealed area to get another independent starting point.\n\nLet's try revealing (2,2).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a cell away from the current cluster to expand the board.\n\nMOVE: 2,2,false\n\nSuppose that (2,2) reveals a '0'.\n\nIn Minesweeper, a '0' means that the cell has no adjacent bombs, and all its neighboring cells are automatically revealed.\n\nSo, the board now might look like:\n\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 . . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n1 . . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n2 . . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n3 . . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n4 . . . . 3 2 1 . . .\n\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nAssuming that revealing (2,2) as '0' clears out its 8 neighboring cells, making them all ' _ ' (empty revealed spaces).\n\nNow, I have a cleared area at (2,2) and a cluster at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\nI need to find a way to connect these areas or expand them safely.\n\nPerhaps I should try revealing (3,4), which is adjacent to both the '3' and the '2'.\n\nEXPLANATION: Trying to connect the revealed areas by revealing a cell adjacent to multiple numbers.\n\nMOVE: 3,4,false\n\nSuppose that (3,4) reveals a '1'.\n\nNow, the board looks like:\n\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 . . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n1 . . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n2 . . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n3 . . _ _ 1 . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . 3 2 1 . . .\n\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nNow, I have '1' at (3,4), '3' at (4,4), '2' at (4,5), and '1' at (4,6).\n\nLet's see if I can deduce any bomb positions.\n\nLooking at (3,4)=1, its neighbors are:\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nBut since (4,4)=3 and (4,5)=2, and (3,4)=1, there's some overlap.\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Maybe I should consider the possibility of placing a flag in a likely bomb location.\n\nLooking at the '3' at (4,4), if I can identify which of its neighbors are bombs, I can flag them.\n\nLet's list the neighbors of (4,4)=3:\n\n- (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nNow, I know that exactly three of these are bombs.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5)=2 has neighbors:\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nAnd exactly two of these are bombs.\n\nAlso, (4,6)=1 has neighbors:\n\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n\nAnd exactly one of these is a bomb.\n\nThis seems like a system of equations where I can try to solve for the bomb positions.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated for me to handle without a systematic approach.\n\nMaybe I should look for cells that are definitely safe or definitely bombs.\n\nLooking at (4,6)=1, which has neighbors:\n\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n\nAnd only one of these is a bomb.\n\nBut (4,5)=2, which shares some of these neighbors, specifically (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nWait, (4,5)=2 has neighbors:\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nAnd (4,6)=1 has neighbors:\n\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n\nCommon neighbors are: (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nGiven that (4,5)=2 and (4,6)=1, and they share some neighbors, perhaps I can find a way to deduce some bomb positions.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try revealing another cell that's not yet touched.\n\nLet's try revealing (5,4).\n\nEXPLANATION: Trying to expand the revealed area by revealing a new cell.\n\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n\nSuppose that (5,4) reveals a '2'.\n\nNow, the board looks like:\n\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n0 . . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n1 . . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n2 . . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n3 . . _ _ 1 . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . 3 2 1 . . .\n\n5 . . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nNow, I have '2' at (5,4), which has neighbors:\n\n- (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nBut since the board is 10x10, all these are within bounds.\n\nNow, I need to see how this new '2' relates to the existing numbers.\n\nThis is getting quite complex.

Let's see what I can figure out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. Here's what I see:\n\n- There are some revealed squares with numbers, and some unexplored squares.\n\n- I have 10 flags left to place, and there are 10 bombs in total.\n\n- The board is 10x10, so there are 100 squares in total.\n\nLet me try to map out what's known and what's unknown.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Columns 0 to 4 have some revealed squares, and columns 5 to 9 are either numbered or unexplored.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At (0,4), there's a '1', which means there's exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares.\n\n- Columns 5 to 9 in row 0 are either '.' (unexplored) or '.' again, which might just be a typo, but I'll assume they are all unexplored.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nRow 0: _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: _ 1 1 1 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 2: _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRows 4 to 9 are mostly unexplored, with some dots.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the coordinates. You've mentioned that (0,0) is the top-left corner, and (9,9) is the bottom-right.\n\nLet's try to list out the revealed numbers and see what we can deduce.\n\nFrom row 0:\n\n- (0,4): '1'\n\nFrom row 1:\n\n- (1,1): '1'\n\n- (1,2): '1'\n\n- (1,3): '1'\n\n- (1,4): '2'\n\nFrom row 2:\n\n- (2,1): '1'\n\nFrom row 3:\n\n- (3,0): '1'\n\n- (3,1): '2'\n\nOkay, so let's consider the clusters.\n\nStarting with the cluster around (1,1):\n\n- (1,1): '1'\n\n- (1,2): '1'\n\n- (1,3): '1'\n\n- (1,4): '2'\n\n- (2,1): '1'\n\n- (3,0): '1'\n\n- (3,1): '2'\n\nAnd some empty spaces around them.\n\nLet me try to visualize this small section:\n\nRow 0: _ _ _ _ 1 .\n\nRow 1: _ 1 1 1 2 .\n\nRow 2: _ 1 . . .\n\nRow 3: 1 2 . . .\n\nI need to think about the possible locations of bombs based on these numbers.\n\nLet's consider (1,4): '2'\n\nThis means there are exactly two bombs in the eight surrounding squares.\n\nThe surrounding squares are:\n\n- (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)\n\n- (1,3), (1,5)\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nBut some of these are unexplored or already numbered.\n\nWait, but in the board, positions (0,5) and beyond are dots, meaning unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is a dot, and (2,5) is a dot.\n\n(0,3) is '_', which is an empty revealed space, meaning no bomb there.\n\n(0,4) is '1', which is already accounted for.\n\n(1,3) is '1'\n\n(2,3) is '.', unexplored\n\n(2,4) is '.', unexplored\n\nSo, for (1,4): '2', the possible bomb locations are in (2,3), (2,4), (1,5), perhaps.\n\nBut I need to consider other numbers as well.\n\nLet's look at (1,3): '1'\n\nIt's surrounded by:\n\n- (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)\n\n- (1,2), (1,4)\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (0,3) is empty, no bomb\n\n- (0,4) is '1'\n\n- (1,2) is '1'\n\n- (1,4) is '2'\n\n- (2,2) is '.', unexplored\n\n- (2,3) is '.', unexplored\n\n- (2,4) is '.', unexplored\n\nSo, for (1,3): '1', there is one bomb in these surroundings.\n\nBut (1,4): '2' overlaps with this, so there's some interaction here.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look at another part of the board.\n\nLooking at row 3:\n\n- (3,0): '1'\n\n- (3,1): '2'\n\nAnd (2,1): '1'\n\nLet's see what's around (3,0): '1'\n\nSurrounding squares:\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n- (3,1), (3,2)\n\n- (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nCurrently:\n\n- (2,1): '1'\n\n- (3,1): '2'\n\nThe rest are unexplored.\n\nSo, for (3,0): '1', there is one bomb in these eight surrounding squares.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1): '2' has two bombs in its surrounding squares.\n\nLet me see if I can find a way to place flags here without conflicting with the numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the possible bomb locations based on these numbers.\n\nLet's consider the unexplored squares around these numbers.\n\nAround (3,0): '1'\n\nPossible bomb squares: (2,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nAround (3,1): '2'\n\nPossible bomb squares: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nWait, but (2,1) is '1', which is already considered.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for a square that must be safe to reveal or must be a bomb.\n\nLooking back at the original cluster around (1,1):\n\n- There are several '1's and a '2', but no clear indication of where the bombs are yet.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the total number of flags I can place.\n\nI have 10 flags left, and there are 10 bombs in total.\n\nSo, if I can find 10 squares that must contain bombs, I can flag them all and win.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find a square that cannot contain a bomb, I can safely reveal it.\n\nLet me try to look for a square that must be safe.\n\nLooking at (0,0): it's '_', which is an empty revealed space, meaning no bomb there.\n\nLooking at (0,4): '1', so one adjacent bomb.\n\nIts surroundings are:\n\n- (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)\n\n- (1,3), (1,4)\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nBut (0,3) is '_', no bomb\n\n(0,4) is '1', no bomb\n\n(0,5) is '.', unknown\n\n(1,3) is '1', no bomb (wait, no, '1' is a number, meaning it's a revealed number, not a bomb)\n\nWait, I need to be careful.\n\nA number indicates how many bombs are in the adjacent squares, not whether it's a bomb itself.\n\nSo, (0,4): '1' means there is one bomb in the eight surrounding squares.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4): '2' means two bombs in its eight surrounding squares.\n\nLet me try to see if I can find overlapping areas where I can deduce something.\n\nLet's consider the squares around (1,4): '2'\n\nPossible bomb squares: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nBut (0,3) is '_', no bomb\n\n(0,4) is '1', no bomb\n\n(1,3) is '1', no bomb\n\nSo, possible bomb squares are: (0,5), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nSimilarly, (1,3): '1' has possible bomb squares: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\nWait, but (2,2) is '.', unexplored\n\nSo, for (1,3): '1', there is one bomb in: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\nAnd for (1,4): '2', there are two bombs in: (0,5), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky.\n\nMaybe I should look at another part of the board.\n\nLooking at (3,0): '1'\n\nIts possible bomb squares: (2,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nAnd (3,1): '2'\n\nIts possible bomb squares: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nWait, (2,1) is '1', which means in its surroundings: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nBut (3,0) and (3,1) are already considered.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total number of possible bomb squares and see if I can place flags accordingly.\n\nI have 10 flags left, and there are 10 bombs.\n\nIf I can find 10 specific squares that must contain bombs, I can flag them all.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find a square that cannot contain a bomb, I can safely reveal it.\n\nLet me try to look for a square that must be safe.\n\nLooking at (4,0): it's '.', unexplored\n\nLooking at its surroundings:\n\n- (3,0): '1'\n\n- (3,1): '2'\n\n- (4,1): '.'\n\n- (5,0): '.'\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\n- (4,-1): out of bounds\n\n- (5,-1): out of bounds\n\nSo, for (4,0), its neighbors are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1)\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine if (4,0) is safe or not.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3): '.', unexplored\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\n- (2,2), (2,4)\n\n- (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nBut again, not enough information.\n\nMaybe I should consider the cluster around (1,1) more carefully.\n\nLooking at (1,1): '1'\n\nIts surroundings:\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n\n- (1,0), (1,2)\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nBut (0,0) is '_', no bomb\n\n(0,1) is '.', unexplored\n\n(0,2) is '.', unexplored\n\n(1,0) is '_', no bomb\n\n(1,2) is '1'\n\n(2,0) is '.', unexplored\n\n(2,1) is '1'\n\n(2,2) is '.', unexplored\n\nSo, for (1,1): '1', there is one bomb in: (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)\n\nSimilarly, (1,2): '1', with surroundings:\n\n- (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)\n\n- (1,1), (1,3)\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\nBut (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are relevant.\n\nGiven that (1,1): '1' and (1,2): '1', there seems to be some overlap in possible bomb locations.\n\nThis is getting too intricate for me to deduce anything concrete right now.\n\nPerhaps I should consider making a move in a area with fewer uncertainties.\n\nLooking at row 9, which is entirely unexplored.\n\nBut moving there might not be informed, as I have no adjacent numbers to guide me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to reveal a square that seems safe based on the current numbers.\n\nFor example, looking at (0,5): '.'\n\nIts surroundings are:\n\n- (0,4): '1'\n\n- (0,6): '.'\n\n- (1,4): '2'\n\n- (1,5): '.'\n\n- (1,6): '.'\n\nAssuming (0,5) is safe, revealing it might give me more information.\n\nBut I need to be cautious not to step on a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place a flag on a square that seems likely to contain a bomb.\n\nLooking back at the cluster around (1,4): '2'\n\nPossible bomb squares: (0,5), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nBut I have no confirmed bombs yet.\n\nWait, actually, I don't have any flags placed yet, as per the board state.\n\nFlags remaining: 10, which means none have been placed yet.\n\nSo, I need to start placing flags where it's certain there are bombs.\n\nBut based on the current information, I don't see any obvious places where a bomb must be.\n\nPerhaps I should reveal a square that seems safe.\n\nLooking at (4,4): '.'\n\nIts surroundings are all unexplored, so revealing it might not provide much information.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (1,5): '.'\n\nIts surroundings are:\n\n- (0,4): '1'\n\n- (0,5): '.'\n\n- (0,6): '.'\n\n- (1,4): '2'\n\n- (1,6): '.'\n\n- (2,4): '.'\n\n- (2,5): '.'\n\n- (2,6): '.'\n\nRevealing (1,5) might give me more information about the '2' at (1,4).\n\nBut there's a risk, as I don't know for sure if it's a bomb or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal (2,3): '.'\n\nIts surroundings are:\n\n- (1,2): '1'\n\n- (1,3): '1'\n\n- (1,4): '2'\n\n- (2,2): '.'\n\n- (2,4): '.'\n\n- (3,2): '.'\n\n- (3,3): '.'\n\n- (3,4): '.'\n\nGiven that (1,3): '1' and (1,4): '2', revealing (2,3) might help clarify the bomb positions.\n\nBut again, there's a risk.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability.\n\nI have 10 bombs left, and a lot of unexplored squares.\n\nIf I reveal a random square, the probability of hitting a bomb is 10 divided by the number of unexplored squares.\n\nLet's see how many squares are unexplored.\n\nTotal squares: 100\n\nRevealed squares: looking at the board, rows 0-3 have some revealed squares.\n\nRow 0: 5 revealed, 5 unexplored\n\nRow 1: 5 revealed, 5 unexplored\n\nRow 2: 2 revealed, 8 unexplored\n\nRow 3: 2 revealed, 8 unexplored\n\nRows 4-9: 0 revealed, 60 unexplored\n\nSo total revealed: 5 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 14\n\nTotal unexplored: 100 - 14 = 86\n\nTherefore, the probability of hitting a bomb by revealing a random square is 10/86 \u2248 11.6%.\n\nThat's fairly high, so I should try to make an informed decision.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place a flag on a square that seems likely to contain a bomb.\n\nLooking back at the cluster around (1,4): '2'\n\nPossible bomb squares: (0,5), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nIf I assume that (0,5), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are candidates for the two bombs required by (1,4): '2'\n\nBut I need to consider other numbers as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the possible combinations.\n\nLet's say for (1,4): '2', the bombs are in two of these five squares: (0,5), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nSimilarly, maybe there are constraints from other numbers.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that (0,5) and (1,5) are in the same column, and (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are in the same row.\n\nBut that doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the bigger picture.\n\nI have 10 flags to place, and 10 bombs in total.\n\nIf I can find 10 squares that must contain bombs, I can flag them all.\n\nBut right now, I don't have enough information to pinpoint exactly where all the bombs are.\n\nMaybe I should reveal a square that seems safer based on the current numbers.\n\nLooking at (5,5): '.'\n\nIts surroundings are all unexplored, so revealing it might not provide much information, but it's also not immediately risky based on the current numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal (1,5): '.'\n\nGiven that it's adjacent to (1,4): '2', which has two bombs in its surroundings.\n\nRevealing (1,5) could either be safe or be a bomb.\n\nBut considering that (1,4): '2' has two bombs in its surroundings, and (1,5) is one of them, there's a chance it's a bomb.\n\nBut I don't know for sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place a flag on (1,5): '.'\n\nBut then I need to make sure that it doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nWait, but I don't have any other information to confirm that (1,5) is a bomb.\n\nMaybe I should consider that if I place a flag on (1,5), then for (1,4): '2', one bomb is accounted for, meaning there's one more bomb in the remaining surroundings: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (0,5), (1,5)\n\nBut if I flag (1,5), then one bomb is there, so one more in the remaining four squares.\n\nBut that doesn't help me much.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for me to decide.\n\nPerhaps I should reveal a square that seems safer.\n\nLooking at (4,4): '.'\n\nIts surroundings are all unexplored, so revealing it might not provide much information, but it's also not immediately risky based on the current numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal (2,3): '.'\n\nGiven that it's adjacent to (1,3): '1' and (1,4): '2', revealing it might give me more information about those numbers.\n\nBut there's a risk it could be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reveal (0,5): '.'\n\nIt's adjacent to (0,4): '1' and (1,4): '2'.\n\nIf I reveal (0,5), and it's a bomb, then (1,4): '2' would have its two bombs accounted for in (0,5) and perhaps another square.\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider that (0,5) is more likely to be a bomb because it's adjacent to two numbers, (0,4): '1' and (1,4): '2'.\n\nIf I flag (0,5), then for (0,4): '1', the bomb is accounted for, and for (1,4): '2', one bomb is accounted for, needing one more in the remaining squares.\n\nBut again, I don't have enough information to be certain.\n\nPerhaps I should reveal (2,3): '.'\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes.\n\nIf (2,3) is a bomb, then (1,3): '1' would have its bomb accounted for in (2,3), and (1,4): '2' would still need one more bomb in its surroundings.\n\nBut if (2,3) is not a bomb, then (1,3): '1' must have its bomb in another adjacent square, like (2,2) or (2,4).\n\nThis is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should just pick a square with the lowest probability of being a bomb.\n\nGiven that there are 10 bombs and 86 unexplored squares, the probability is about 11.6%, as I calculated earlier.\n\nIf I can find a square with fewer adjacent unexplored squares that have numbers indicating bombs, it might be safer.\n\nBut right now, most of the numbers are in the top rows, and the bottom rows are entirely unexplored.\n\nPerhaps revealing a square in the bottom rows would be safer, as there are no adjacent numbers indicating bombs yet.\n\nFor example, (9,0): '.'\n\nIts surroundings are all out of bounds or unexplored, so revealing it might be safer, but it also won't give me much information.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (1,5): '.'\n\nIt's adjacent to (1,4): '2', which has two bombs in its surroundings.\n\nIf I reveal (1,5) and it's a bomb, then I lose.\n\nBut if it's safe, I get more information.\n\nGiven that I have to take some risk, perhaps revealing (1,5) is a reasonable move.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps placing a flag on (1,5) is safer, but I don't have enough certainty to do that.\n\nGiven that, I think I'll choose to reveal (1,5).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed in this Minesweeper game, we need to make an informed decision about our next move. Given the current state of the board and the information available, we will attempt to reveal a square that seems relatively safe based on the adjacent numbers.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Analyze Revealed Numbers:** Look at the numbers on the board to understand the distribution of potential bombs around them.\n2. **Identify Safe Squares:** Find squares that are adjacent to numbers where the required number of bombs is already flagged or can be deduced to be safe.\n3. **Calculate Probabilities:** If direct deduction isn't possible, consider the probability of a square containing a bomb based on the total remaining bombs and unexplored squares.\n4. **Make a Move:** Choose to either reveal a square or place a flag based on the analysis.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a step-by-step reasoning process for a game scenario, there isn't a traditional code solution. However, the decision-making process can be outlined as follows:\n\n```plaintext\nEXPLANATION: After analyzing the board, the square at (1,5) seems like a reasonable choice to reveal next. It is adjacent to the number '2' at (1,4), indicating that there are two bombs in the surrounding squares. By revealing (1,5), we can gain more information about the bomb locations in this area.\n\nMOVE: 1,5,false\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Analyze Revealed Numbers:** We looked at the numbers '1' and '2' and their adjacent squares to understand potential bomb locations.\n- **Identify Safe Squares:** We considered squares around these numbers to see if any could be safely revealed or if flags should be placed.\n- **Calculate Probabilities:** With 10 bombs remaining and many unexplored squares, the general probability of hitting a bomb is about 11.6%. However, by choosing a square adjacent to numbered squares, we can potentially gain more information to make better decisions in subsequent moves.\n- **Make a Move:** Decided to reveal the square at (1,5) to gather more information about the bomb locations in that area.\n\nThis approach balances the risk of hitting a bomb with the need to gain more information about the board's state.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ 1 . . . . .\n1 _ 1 1 1 2 . . . . .\n2 _ 1 . . . . . . . .\n3 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left, with 10 flags remaining. That means all the bombs should still be unflagged.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the revealed numbers and see what they tell me about the surrounding squares.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Column 4 has a '1', and next to it is a '.' which is unexplored, and then '1', '.', '.', '.'.\n\nIn row 1:\n\n- Column 0 has a '_', column 1 has '1', column 2 has '1', column 3 has '1', column 4 has '2', column 5 has '2', column 6 has '2', and then '.'s.\n\nIn row 2:\n\n- Column 0 has '_', column 1 has '1', column 2 has '.', column 3 has '.', column 4 has '1', column 5 has '.', column 6 has '2', and then '.'s.\n\nIn row 3:\n\n- Column 0 has '1', column 1 has '2', then '.'s.\n\nRows 4 through 9 are all '.'s, which means they're unexplored.\n\nOkay, let's start by looking at the numbers and seeing what they tell me about the surrounding squares.\n\nFirst, in row 0, column 4 has a '1'. That means there is exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares. The surrounding squares are:\n\n- (0,3), (0,5)\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nBut (1,4) is a '2', which means it's already revealed, so it's not a bomb. Similarly, (0,5) is a '.', which is unexplored, and (1,5) is a '2'. Wait, (1,5) is a '2', which means it has two adjacent bombs.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at row 1, column 5, which is a '2'. Let's see its surroundings:\n\n- (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)\n\n- (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\n- (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nFrom this, (1,5) is '2', so it has exactly two bombs in these eight surrounding squares.\n\nBut (1,4) is '2', which is already revealed, so it's not a bomb. (1,6) is '2' as well, already revealed, so not a bomb. (0,5) is '.', unexplored. (0,6) is '1', revealed, so not a bomb. (2,5) is '.', unexplored. (2,4) is '1', revealed, so not a bomb. So, the possible bomb locations around (1,5) are (0,5) and (2,5).\n\nSince it needs exactly two bombs, and only (0,5) and (2,5) are possible, both must be bombs.\n\nSo, I can flag (0,5) and (2,5) as bombs.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure this is correct.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- (1,5) is '2', and its neighbors are:\n\n- (0,4): '.', unexplored\n\n- (0,5): '.', unexplored\n\n- (0,6): '1', revealed, safe\n\n- (1,4): '2', revealed, safe\n\n- (1,6): '2', revealed, safe\n\n- (2,4): '1', revealed, safe\n\n- (2,5): '.', unexplored\n\n- (2,6): '2', revealed, safe\n\nSo, only (0,5) and (2,5) are unexplored, and since (1,5) shows '2', both must be bombs.\n\nSimilarly, looking at (0,4), which is '1', its neighbors are:\n\n- (0,3), (0,5)\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nFrom these:\n\n- (0,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (0,5): now we think is a bomb\n\n- (1,3): '1', revealed, safe\n\n- (1,4): '2', revealed, safe\n\n- (1,5): '2', revealed, safe\n\n- (2,3): '.', unexplored\n\n- (2,4): '1', revealed, safe\n\n- (2,5): '.', unexplored, probably bomb\n\nBut since (0,4) is '1', and (0,5) is probably a bomb, then there should be only one bomb in its neighbors. If (0,5) is a bomb, then no other neighbors should be bombs.\n\nBut wait, (2,5) is also probably a bomb, but it's a neighbor of (0,4). Wait, is (2,5) a neighbor of (0,4)? Let's see:\n\n(0,4)'s neighbors are:\n\n- (0,3), (0,5)\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nSo yes, (2,5) is a neighbor.\n\nSo, if (0,5) and (2,5) are both bombs, but (0,4) is '1', which should only have one bomb in its neighbors, but it has two bombs in its neighbors, which is a conflict.\n\nWait, this can't be right. There's a mistake here.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nIf (1,5) is '2', and its neighbors are:\n\n- (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)\n\n- (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\n- (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nOut of these, (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6) are revealed and safe.\n\nSo, possible bombs are (0,4), (0,5), (2,5).\n\nBut (1,5) is '2', so exactly two of these are bombs: (0,4), (0,5), (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, (0,4) is '1', and its neighbors are:\n\n- (0,3), (0,5)\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nOut of these, (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,4) are revealed and safe.\n\nSo, possible bombs are (0,3), (0,5), (2,5).\n\nBut (0,4) is '1', so only one of these is a bomb: (0,3), (0,5), (2,5).\n\nBut from (1,5)'s perspective, two of (0,4), (0,5), (2,5) are bombs.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nFrom (1,5)'s perspective:\n\n- Possible bombs: (0,4), (0,5), (2,5)\n\n- Exactly two of these are bombs.\n\nFrom (0,4)'s perspective:\n\n- Possible bombs: (0,3), (0,5), (2,5)\n\n- Exactly one of these is a bomb.\n\nSo, combining these:\n\nLet's consider the overlap between the two sets.\n\nBoth involve (0,5) and (2,5).\n\nSo, let's consider the possibilities:\n\nCase 1:\n\n- (0,5) is a bomb\n\n- (2,5) is a bomb\n\n- Then, for (0,4), which should have only one bomb in its neighbors, but it has two bombs ((0,5) and (2,5)), which is a conflict.\n\nSo, this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2:\n\n- (0,5) is a bomb\n\n- (2,5) is not a bomb\n\n- Then, for (1,5), which needs two bombs, but only (0,5) is a bomb, and (0,4) would need to be a bomb as well.\n\n- But if (0,4) is a bomb, then (0,4)'s neighbors would have (0,5) and (0,4) as bombs, which is two bombs, but (0,4) is '1', which requires only one bomb. Conflict.\n\nSo, this case is also invalid.\n\nCase 3:\n\n- (0,5) is not a bomb\n\n- (2,5) is a bomb\n\n- Then, for (1,5), which needs two bombs: (0,4) and (2,5). So, (0,4) must be a bomb.\n\n- For (0,4), which is '1', its possible bombs are (0,3), (0,5), (2,5). If (0,4) is a bomb, that would make two bombs in its neighbors: (0,4) and (2,5). But (0,4) is '1', which should only have one bomb. Conflict.\n\nSo, this case is invalid.\n\nCase 4:\n\n- (0,5) is not a bomb\n\n- (2,5) is not a bomb\n\n- Then, for (1,5), which needs two bombs: but neither (0,4), (0,5), nor (2,5) are bombs, which contradicts (1,5)'s '2'. So, invalid.\n\nAll cases lead to conflicts. That means there's an error in my assumptions.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me look again.\n\nWait, (1,5) is '2', so two bombs in (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). But (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6) are safe, so only (0,4), (0,5), (2,5) can be bombs.\n\nSimilarly, (0,4) is '1', so only one bomb in (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). But (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,4) are safe, so only (0,3), (0,5), (2,5) can be bombs.\n\nSo, for (1,5): two bombs in (0,4), (0,5), (2,5)\n\nFor (0,4): one bomb in (0,3), (0,5), (2,5)\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that (0,4) is '1', and (1,5) is '2', and their overlapping possible bomb squares.\n\nLet me consider that (0,4) must have exactly one bomb in (0,3), (0,5), (2,5)\n\nAnd (1,5) must have exactly two bombs in (0,4), (0,5), (2,5)\n\nBut (0,4) is not a bomb, because it's revealed.\n\nWait, no, (0,4) is '1', which is revealed, so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is '2', revealed, safe.\n\nSo, their possible bombs are in (0,3), (0,5), (2,5)\n\nFor (0,4): one bomb in (0,3), (0,5), (2,5)\n\nFor (1,5): two bombs in (0,4), (0,5), (2,5)\n\nBut (0,4) is safe, so for (1,5), the two bombs must be in (0,5) and (2,5)\n\nBut then, for (0,4), which has one bomb in (0,3), (0,5), (2,5), and if (0,5) and (2,5) are both bombs, that's two bombs, which conflicts with (0,4)'s '1'\n\nWait, but (0,4) only has one bomb in its neighbors, but if both (0,5) and (2,5) are bombs, that would be two bombs, which contradicts (0,4)'s '1'\n\nSo, there's a problem here.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nMaybe (1,5) does not have two bombs in (0,5) and (2,5), but perhaps one of them is not a bomb.\n\nWait, but if (1,5) needs two bombs, and only (0,5) and (2,5) are possible, then both must be bombs.\n\nBut that creates a conflict with (0,4)'s '1'\n\nThis suggests that perhaps there's an error in the board or my logic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another square that can be considered.\n\nLet me look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 4, which is '2'\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nFrom this, (1,4) is '2', safe.\n\n(1,5) is '2', safe.\n\n(0,4) is '1', safe.\n\n(2,4) is '1', safe.\n\nSo, possible bombs are (0,3), (0,5), (2,3), (2,5)\n\nIt needs two bombs in these neighbors.\n\nSimilarly, (0,4) needs one bomb in (0,3), (0,5), (2,5)\n\nAnd (1,5) needs two bombs in (0,4), (0,5), (2,5)\n\nBut (0,4) is safe, so (1,5) needs two bombs in (0,5) and (2,5)\n\nBut then (0,4) needs one bomb in (0,3), (0,5), (2,5)\n\nIf (0,5) and (2,5) are both bombs, then (0,4) has two bombs in its neighbors, which contradicts its '1'\n\nSo, this is a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that (1,5) does not have two bombs in (0,5) and (2,5), but maybe one of them is not a bomb.\n\nWait, but if (1,5) needs two bombs and only (0,5) and (2,5) are possible, then both must be bombs.\n\nBut that leads to a contradiction with (0,4)'s '1'\n\nThis suggests that perhaps there's an error in the board setup or my logic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nLet me consider that perhaps (0,5) is not a bomb.\n\nIf (0,5) is not a bomb, then for (1,5)'s '2', the two bombs must be in (0,4) and (2,5)\n\nBut (0,4) is '1', which is safe, so that can't be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, (0,5) must be a bomb.\n\nIf (0,5) is a bomb, then for (1,5)'s '2', the other bomb must be in (2,5)\n\nThen, for (0,4)'s '1', with (0,5) being a bomb, there should be only one bomb in its neighbors, which is (0,5), so no other bombs in (0,3) and (2,5)\n\nBut if (2,5) is not a bomb, then (1,5)'s '2' would only have one bomb in its neighbors, which is (0,5), but it needs two bombs.\n\nSo, this is also a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the only consistent scenario is that both (0,5) and (2,5) are bombs, but that conflicts with (0,4)'s '1'\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to look at another part of the board.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 5, which is '2'\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\n- (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n- (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\nFrom this, (1,4) is '2', safe\n\n(1,5) is '2', safe\n\n(1,6) is '2', safe\n\n(2,4) is '1', safe\n\n(2,5) is '.', unexplored\n\n(2,6) is '.', unexplored\n\n(3,4) is '.', unexplored\n\n(3,5) is '.', unexplored\n\n(3,6) is '.', unexplored\n\nSo, (2,5) and (2,6) are unexplored, and possibly bombs.\n\nBut (2,5) is already considered possibly a bomb from earlier.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) are unexplored.\n\nBut (2,5) is already causing confusion.\n\nMaybe I should look at row 3, column 0, which is '1'\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- (2,0), (2,1)\n\n- (3,0), (3,1)\n\n- (4,0), (4,1)\n\nBut these are all unexplored except (2,1) which is '1', safe.\n\nSo, (3,0) is '1', so one bomb in its neighbors: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1)\n\nBut (2,1) is '1', safe.\n\nSo, only (2,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1) could be bombs.\n\nBut with only one bomb in these four squares.\n\nThis might be useful later.\n\nSimilarly, row 3, column 1 is '2'\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n- (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n- (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nFrom this, (2,1) is '1', safe\n\n(3,0) is '1', safe\n\n(3,1) is '2', safe\n\nAssuming the others are unexplored.\n\nSo, possible bombs are in (2,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nBut (2,1) is '1', which is safe, and its neighbors are (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1)\n\nWait, no, (2,1)'s neighbors are:\n\n- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n- (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nBut (2,1) is '1', so only one bomb in these neighbors.\n\nBut many of these are unexplored.\n\nThis seems too vague to make a conclusion.\n\nMaybe I should consider the initial conflict again.\n\nGiven that all scenarios lead to a conflict, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to accept that (0,5) and (2,5) are both bombs, even though it conflicts with (0,4)'s '1', suggesting that the board may have an error.\n\nBut assuming it's solvable, perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the neighbors.\n\nLet me double-check the neighbors for (0,4):\n\nIt should be:\n\n- (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nBut (0,4) is '1', and it's revealed, so its neighbors have exactly one bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is '2', so its neighbors have exactly two bombs.\n\nIf (0,5) and (2,5) are both bombs, then (0,4) has two bombs in its neighbors, which contradicts its '1'\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for both (0,5) and (2,5) to be bombs.\n\nBut (1,5) requires two bombs in its neighbors, which are (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nBut (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6) are safe, so only (0,5) and (2,5) can be bombs.\n\nBut if both are bombs, it conflicts with (0,4)'s '1'\n\nTherefore, perhaps (1,5)'s '2' does not include (0,4), wait, but (0,4) is revealed and safe.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that (0,4) is safe, so (1,5)'s two bombs are in (0,5) and (2,5)\n\nBut that creates a conflict with (0,4)'s '1'\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that (0,5) is not a bomb.\n\nIf (0,5) is not a bomb, then for (1,5)'s '2', the two bombs must be in (0,4) and (2,5)\n\nBut (0,4) is revealed and safe, so that can't be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, (0,5) must be a bomb.\n\nThen, for (1,5)'s '2', the other bomb must be in (2,5)\n\nBut then (0,4)'s '1' would have (0,5) and (2,5) as bombs, which is two bombs, conflicting with its '1'\n\nThis seems unsolvable.\n\nPerhaps I need to look at another part of the board to find a safer move.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0, which is '1'\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- (2,0), (2,1)\n\n- (3,0), (3,1)\n\n- (4,0), (4,1)\n\nFrom this, (2,1) is '1', safe\n\n(3,0) is '1', safe\n\nSo, possible bombs are in (2,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1)\n\nBut only one of them can be a bomb, because (3,0) is '1'\n\nSimilarly, row 3, column 1 is '2'\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n- (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n- (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nFrom this, (2,1) is '1', safe\n\n(3,0) is '1', safe\n\n(3,1) is '2', safe\n\nSo, possible bombs are in (2,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nBut (3,0) is '1', with possible bombs in (2,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1)\n\nAnd (3,1) is '2', with possible bombs in (2,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider that (2,0) is a bomb.\n\nIf (2,0) is a bomb, then for (3,0)'s '1', only (2,0) is a bomb, which satisfies it.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,1)'s '2', the bombs would need to be in (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nBut only one bomb is already accounted for in (2,0), but (3,1) needs two bombs in its neighbors.\n\nWait, no, bombs are only in the unexplored squares.\n\nWait, if (2,0) is a bomb, then for (3,1)'s '2', it still needs one more bomb in its neighbors: (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nSo, one of those needs to be a bomb.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if (2,0) is not a bomb, then for (3,0)'s '1', the bomb must be in (3,1), (4,0), or (4,1)\n\nBut (3,1) is '2', which is revealed and safe, so it can't be a bomb.\n\nTherefore, the bomb must be in (4,0) or (4,1)\n\nThen, for (3,1)'s '2', the bombs would need to be in (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nBut if (4,0) or (4,1) is a bomb, that accounts for one bomb, so another bomb must be in (2,2), (3,2), or (4,2)\n\nThis seems possible.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability or look for a square that is definitely safe or definitely a bomb.\n\nLooking back at the initial conflict, perhaps I need to accept that (0,5) and (2,5) are both bombs, even with the conflict, and proceed accordingly.\n\nIf I flag both (0,5) and (2,5) as bombs, then (0,4)'s '1' would have two bombs in its neighbors, which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, I cannot do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to conclude that (0,5) is not a bomb, even though it seems necessary for (1,5)'s '2'\n\nBut that leads to a different conflict.\n\nThis is really confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look at row 0, column 9, which is '.', unexplored.\n\nBut it's far from any numbers, so it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, row 9, column 0, which is '.', unexplored.\n\nAgain, no information there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the initial board has an error, but assuming it's solvable, there must be a way.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider multiple layers of inference.\n\nLet me try to make a list of all possible bomb locations based on the revealed numbers.\n\nFrom (0,4)'s '1', its neighbors have exactly one bomb: (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nBut (1,4), (1,5), (2,4) are safe, so only (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (2,3), (2,5) can be bombs, with exactly one bomb among them.\n\nFrom (1,5)'s '2', its neighbors have exactly two bombs: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nBut (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6) are safe, so only (0,5), (2,5) can be bombs, with exactly two bombs among them.\n\nBut this is impossible because (0,5) and (2,5) are the only possible bombs, but (0,4)'s '1' cannot have two bombs in its neighbors.\n\nThis suggests an inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscount in the neighbors.\n\nLet me double-check the neighbors for (0,4):\n\n- (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nSo, neighbors are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5)\n\nBut (1,5) is '2', safe\n\n(1,3) is '1', safe\n\n(2,5) is '.', unexplored\n\n(2,3) is '.', unexplored\n\n(0,5) is '.', unexplored\n\nSo, possible bombs are in (0,3), (0,5), (2,3), (2,5)\n\nBut (0,4)'s '1' indicates only one of these is a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5)'s '2' needs two bombs in (0,5), (2,5)\n\nBut that would require two bombs in (0,5) and (2,5), which conflicts with (0,4)'s '1'\n\nThis suggests that the only consistent scenario is that (0,5) is not a bomb, and (2,5) is a bomb.\n\nThen, for (0,4)'s '1', if (0,5) is not a bomb, then the bomb must be in (2,5)\n\nThen, for (1,5)'s '2', if (0,5) is not a bomb and (2,5) is a bomb, then another bomb must be in (0,4)\n\nBut (0,4) is '1', which is revealed and safe, so that's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (0,5) is a bomb, and (2,5) is not a bomb.\n\nThen, for (0,4)'s '1', with (0,5) being a bomb, there should be only one bomb in its neighbors, which is (0,5)\n\nBut then, for (1,5)'s '2', it needs two bombs in (0,5) and (2,5), but if (2,5) is not a bomb, then only one bomb is present, which is a conflict.\n\nThis is really confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the board has a mistake, but assuming it's solvable, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look at the bigger picture and consider the total number of bombs and flags.\n\nThere are 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining.\n\nBut I don't know how many bombs are already flagged.\n\nAssuming none are flagged yet, I need to place 10 flags.\n\nBut given the conflicts, it's hard to determine where to place them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that some squares are definitely safe to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 0, which is '.', unexplored.\n\nIt's far from any numbers, so revealing it could be risky, but maybe necessary.\n\nAlternatively, row 0, column 0, which is '_', safe.\n\nIts neighbors are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n\nAll are '_', safe.\n\nSo, no information there.\n\nSimilarly, row 0, column 9 is '.', unexplored.\n\nAgain, no information.\n\nThis is really tough.\n\nMaybe I should just pick a square that seems safer based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0, which is '1'\n\nIts neighbors are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1)\n\nFrom this, (2,1) is '1', safe\n\n(3,1) is '2', safe\n\nSo, possible bombs are in (2,0), (4,0), (4,1)\n\nBut only one of them can be a bomb, because (3,0) is '1'\n\nSo, perhaps (2,0) is a bomb, and (4,0) and (4,1) are safe.\n\nAlternatively, (4,0) or (4,1) is a bomb, and (2,0) is safe.\n\nI don't know.\n\nMaybe I can reveal (4,0)\n\nIf (4,0) is a bomb, then I lose.\n\nBut according to the '1', only one of (2,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1) is a bomb.\n\nSo, if I reveal (4,0), there's a chance it's a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, if I flag (2,0), assuming it's a bomb, then (4,0) and (4,1) are safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nThis is too risky.\n\nMaybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 6, which is '2'\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)\n\n- (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n\nFrom this, (1,5) is '2', safe\n\n(1,6) is '2', safe\n\n(2,5) is '.', unexplored\n\n(2,6) is '.', unexplored\n\n(2,7) is '.', unexplored\n\n(3,5) is '.', unexplored\n\n(3,6) is '.', unexplored\n\n(3,7) is '.', unexplored\n\nSo, possible bombs are in (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n\nBut (1,6) is '2', which is safe, and its neighbors are:\n\n- (0,5), (0,6), (0,7)\n\n- (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)\n\n- (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n\nFrom this, (1,5) is '2', safe\n\n(1,6) is '2', safe\n\n(1,7) is '.', unexplored\n\n(2,5) is '.',

(2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (0,7)\n\nBut earlier, from (1,5)'s '2', (0,5) and (2,5) are likely bombs.\n\nBut that creates conflicts.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just pick a square that seems safer.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 0, which is '.', unexplored.\n\nIt's adjacent to row 3, column 0, which is '1'\n\nIf I reveal (4,0), there's a chance it's a bomb, but according to the '1', only one of (2,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1) is a bomb.\n\nSo, if I reveal (4,0), there's a risk, but perhaps I can take it.\n\nAlternatively, if I flag (2,0), assuming it's a bomb, then (4,0) and (4,1) are safe.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nThis is too speculative.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should reveal a square that seems safer.\n\nI'll choose to reveal row 4, column 0.\n\nEXPLANATION: Based on the '1' in row 3, column 0, only one of the squares (2,0), (3,1), (4,0), or (4,1) is a bomb. Assuming (2,0) is not a bomb, then (4,0) and (4,1) are safe. This is a risky move, but necessary to progress.\n\nMOVE: 4,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ 1 . 1 . . .\n1 _ 1 1 1 2 2 2 . . .\n2 _ 1 . . 1 . 2 . . .\n3 1 2 . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
