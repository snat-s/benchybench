Since these 1s are adjacent to each other, it's likely that the bomb is located at position (0,5) or (1,5). However, we can't be certain yet, so let's look for other clues.\n\nAnother area of interest is the bottom-left corner, where we have a revealed 1 at position (8,0). This 1 is adjacent to two unexplored spaces, so it's possible that the bomb is located at either position (7,0) or (8,1). However, we can't rule out the possibility that the bomb is located at a different position altogether.\n\nGiven the current state of the board, it seems like the safest move would be to flag one of the unexplored spaces adjacent to the revealed 1 at position (8,0).

However, we still need to verify that this flag doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nConsidering the remaining number of flags (9) and bombs (10), we should be cautious when placing new flags. We should look for spaces that are likely to be bombs based on the revealed numbers.\n\nOne such space is (6,0), which is adjacent to the flagged space at (7,0) and the number '1' at (5,0).

Since there is already a flag at position (6,0), we can conclude that the bomb adjacent to the '1' at position (5,0) is the one at position (6,0). Now, let's look at the '2' at position (7,7).
