{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let's see, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs left, with 10 flags remaining. Right now, the board is completely unexplored\u2014all dots. That means I have to start from scratch.\n\nHmm, where do I begin? Well, usually, in Minesweeper, you start by revealing a tile, but since the board is completely empty, I don't have any clues yet. Maybe I should just pick a random spot to start. But wait, if I reveal a bomb, the game ends, so I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere. But since I don't have any numbers yet, it's hard to know where the bombs are. Wait, the critical flag placement rules say that I should check all revealed numbers against existing flags, but since there are no numbers yet, maybe I can't place any flags confidently.\n\nSo, perhaps the best move is to reveal a tile. Let's think about where. Maybe the center? Or maybe a corner? I remember that sometimes starting in the middle can give more information, but in a 10x10 board, the center is around (5,5). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: since all tiles are unexplored, maybe I should start by revealing a tile that's likely to be safe. But without any information, it's a gamble. Alternatively, I could place a flag somewhere, but without any clues, it's just a guess.\n\nLet me recap the rules. The goal is to reveal all safe squares or flag all bombs. Numbers show adjacent bombs. I can reveal a square or place/remove a flag. I have to make sure that placing a flag doesn't conflict with any numbers I can see. But since there are no numbers yet, maybe it's safer to reveal a tile.\n\nI think I'll choose to reveal a tile. Let's say (0,0), the top-left corner. But wait, maybe that's risky. Alternatively, maybe (5,5) is a safer bet, but I don't know. Since all squares are the same, maybe it doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere, but without any information, it's just a guess. So perhaps revealing a tile is better.\n\nWait, another approach: since there are 10 bombs and 10 flags left, I might need to place flags as I go. But without any revealed numbers, I can't know where the bombs are. So maybe I should reveal a tile first.\n\nOkay, I think I'll go with revealing (0,0). Let's see what happens. But wait, in the initial state, revealing (0,0) could be a bomb. Oh, that's a risk. Maybe I should pick a different spot.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a tile that's more likely to be safe. But without any information, it's a 10% chance of hitting a bomb. Maybe I should just go for a corner. Let's say (0,0). If it's a bomb, I lose. But if it's a number, I can start deducing from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should pick (4,4), which is near the center. But again, it's a 10% chance.\n\nWait, another thought: since there are 10 bombs, and 10 flags, I need to place 10 flags. But without any information, I can't place them accurately. So, I think I should reveal a tile first.\n\nAlright, I'll go with revealing (0,0). Let's see. If it's a bomb, the game ends. If it's a number, I can start working from there. If it's empty, that's good too.\n\nWait, but maybe I should pick a different spot. Let me think\u2014maybe (0,5). Or (5,0). Hmm, but again, all spots are equally risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place a flag somewhere. But without any numbers, I can't be sure. The critical flag rules say that I should verify that placing a flag doesn't conflict with numbers, but since there are no numbers, maybe it's okay. But I don't want to place a flag where there's no bomb, which would waste a flag.\n\nSo, perhaps revealing a tile is better. Let's go with (0,0). If it's a bomb, I lose. If it's a number, I can proceed. If it's empty, that's good.\n\nWait, but I just thought about it\u2014maybe I should place a flag somewhere. Let's say I flag (0,0). But without any information, that's just a guess. It might not be a bomb. So, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I could place a flag on (9,9), but again, it's just a guess. I think I need to reveal a tile to get some information.\n\nAlright, I'll go with revealing (0,0). Let's see what happens.\n</think>\n\nI decide to reveal the top-left corner to start gathering information.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
