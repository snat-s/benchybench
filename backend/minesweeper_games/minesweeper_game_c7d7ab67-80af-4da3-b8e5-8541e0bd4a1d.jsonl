{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 2, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "To analyze the current state of the Minesweeper board, I'll start by assessing the revealed numbers and their adjacent spaces relative to the existing flags.\n\n### Analysis of Revealed Numbers and Flags:\n1. **Number 1 at (1,0)**: Has 1 adjacent empty space (1,1 - flag). This is consistent since there can be no other bombs adjacent.\n2. **Number 1 at (1,4)**: Has no adjacent flags. Thus, at least 1 bomb must be flagged in adjacent unexamined spaces.\n3. **Number 1 at (1,8)**: Has 1 adjacent flag already (1,9). No more adjacent bombs can be present here.\n4. **Number 2 at (5,0)**: Has no adjacent flags. Must have 2 bombs around it.\n5. **Number 2 at (5,4)**: Has 1 adjacent flag at (5,3). Needs 1 more bomb.\n6. **Number 1 at (5,8)**: It has no adjacent flags. Needs at least 1 bomb.\n7. **Number 1 at (6,9)**: Has 1 adjacent flag (7,9). No other bombs can be present.\n8. **Number 1 at (7,8)**: It has no adjacent flags. Needs 1 bomb.\n\n### Conflict Checking:\n- **Number 1 at (1,0)**: Okay.\n- **Number 1 at (1,4)**: Needs a flag but has none adjacent.\n- **Number 1 at (1,8)**: Okay.\n- **Number 2 at (5,0)**: Needs 2 flags but has none.\n- **Number 2 at (5,4)**: Needs 1 flag but has 1 adjacent.\n- **Number 1 at (5,8)**: Needs 1 flag but has none.\n- **Number 1 at (6,9)**: Okay.\n- **Number 1 at (7,8)**: Needs 1 flag.\n\n### Remaining Flags:\nWe have 10 flags remaining. However, based on the observed numbers alone, we may need to confirm the guesses in order to place flags correctly.\n\n### Decision:\nBased on the above analysis:\n- The position (1,4) needs a flag but requires careful attention to numbers adjacent.\n- The position (5,8) also needs a flag and the numbers around (6,9) imply a need for caution in adjacent tiles.\n  \n#### Move Decision:\nAfter careful observation, the best candidate to reveal without clear conflicts is (2,2):\n- The cell (2,2) is a blank space which is clear of adjacent bombs. It's a reasonable move given that revealing it won't conflict with adjacent numbers at this moment.\n  \nEXPLANATION: Revealing (2, 2) is a safe option as it is currently unexplored and does not have direct conflicts with adjacent numbered squares. It could potentially reveal new information about adjacent squares.\nMOVE: 2,2,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n2 . 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ 1 .\n3 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n4 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . 1 1 2 . 2 2 2 1 _\n6 . . . . . . . . 1 _\n7 . . . . 1 1 2 2 1 _\n8 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 5, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "To determine the next move, let's carefully analyze the board and the current numbers shown on revealed tiles.\n\n### Analysis of the Current Board State:\n- The revealed numbers and their adjacent unexplored spaces can tell us a lot about where bombs might be located.\n  \n1. **Row 1 (numbers: 1, 1, _, _, 1, 1, 1, _, 1, 1)**:\n   - There are numerous unknown squares (4 unexplored).\n   - The numbers suggest that flags are needed adjacent to these squares, especially considering the bomb counts need to satisfy each.\n  \n2. **Row 2 (numbers: 1, 1, _, _, 1, ., 1, _, 1, .)**:\n   - The number '1' at column 2 and 3 means there could be a flag between coordinates (1,1) and (1,3).\n\n3. **Row 3 (same as Row 2)**:\n   - Similar conclusions can be drawn about potential flag locations.\n  \n4. **Row 4 (numbers: ., 1, ., 1, 1, 1, _, _, _, _)**:\n   - Notice the pattern of numbers indicating need for flags adjacent to them.\n\n5. **Row 5 (1, 1, 2, ., . and so on)**:\n   - Here we see a number '2' indicating that two bombs are adjacent, meaning that at least one additional flag must be placed if not already.\n\n6. **Rows 7, 8, and 9**:\n   - They show considerable numbers indicating clear need for further analysis into adjacent tiles.\n  \n### Conclusion on Flagging:\nNext, I observe the row with some certainty:\n- In Row 4, specifically at (4,5), a '1' shows (from 4,4) and could indicate a flag for (5,5).\n\nBy monitoring other rows and checking neighboring numbers again, it appears that in position (4,3) and (4,4), we could potentially assign flags. However, we still have many existing unexplored tiles, which could lead to more safe reveals.\n\n### Safe Move:\nAfter weighing options, it is clear that:\n- (5, 4) is an unexplored square below a '2' (in Row 5) which implies a likely safe reveal or further exploration without risking a game-ending move.\n\nThus, I will decide to **reveal (5, 4)** as it would provide more context and help determine additional moves forward.\n\n### Next Move:\nEXPLANATION: Reveal the tile at coordinates (5,4) to provide additional information about the surrounding area and check for potential bombs safely.\nMOVE: 5,4,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 1 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n2 . 1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ 1 .\n3 . 1 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 1\n4 . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _\n5 . 1 1 2 . 2 2 2 1 _\n6 . . . . . . . . 1 _\n7 . . . . 1 1 2 2 1 _\n8 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _\n9 . . . . 1 _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": false}
