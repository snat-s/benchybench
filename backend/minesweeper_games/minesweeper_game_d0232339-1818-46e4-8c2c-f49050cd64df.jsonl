If a square is adjacent to multiple numbers, its status can sometimes be deduced by comparing the requirements of the adjacent numbers.\n\nFor example, let's examine the square at (5,5):\n\n- It is adjacent to:\n  - (4,4): Number 2\n  - (4,6): Number 1\n  - (5,4): Number 2\n  - (5,6): Number 2\n  - (6,4): Number 1\n  - (6,5): Number 1\n\nEach of these numbers imposes certain constraints on (5,5).\n\n**Analyzing (5,5):**\n\nIf we count the number of bombs adjacent to each numbered tile that includes (5,5):\n\n- For (4,4): Number 2\n- For (4,6): Number 1\n- For (5,4): Number 2\n- For (5,6): Number 2\n- For (6,4): Number 1\n- For (6,5): Number 1\n\nHowever, without additional information, it's challenging to determine the exact status of (5,5). We need to look for other clues.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the Number '2' at (4,4):**\n\nAdjacent squares: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nAll these squares are unexplored.\n\nSimilarly, the number '2' at (5,4), (5,5), and (5,6) have adjacent squares all unexplored.\n\n**Step 5: Look for Squares with Only One Possible Bomb Location**\n\nConsider the number '1' at (4,6):\n\nAdjacent squares: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n\nAll are unexplored, so we cannot determine the bomb's exact location yet.\n\nHowever, let's consider the number '1' at (6,4):\n\nAdjacent squares: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)\n\nIf we assume that (5,4) is a bomb (since it's adjacent to multiple '2's), let's see if that helps.\n\nBut since (5,4) is adjacent to (4,4): Number 2, (5,4) being a bomb would satisfy one of the two required bombs for (4,4). That would leave one more bomb adjacent to (4,4).\n\nHowever, without more information, this line of reasoning doesn't lead us to a definitive conclusion.\n\n**Step 6: Consider the Total Number of Bombs and Flags Remaining**\n\nThe game info states:\n- Board size: 10x10\n- Flags remaining: 10\n- Bombs: 10\n\nSince there are 10 bombs and 10 flags remaining, it's crucial to place flags only when confident to avoid running out of flags prematurely.\n\n**Step 7: Look for Patterns or Symmetries**\n\nExamining the board, there's a cluster of numbers around rows 4-6, columns 4-6. This region is the most active and likely contains multiple bombs.\n\nGiven that, it might be strategic to start revealing squares in less crowded areas to gain more information.\n\n**Step 8: Identify Safe Squares to Reveal**\n\nLooking at the boundaries of the revealed numbers:\n\n- **Row 3:** All squares are unexplored.\n- **Row 7:** All squares are unexplored.\n- **Column 3:** All squares are unexplored.\n- **Column 7:** All squares are unexplored.\n\nRevealing squares along these edges could provide more information without directly interacting with the high-density number area.\n\n**Step 9: Choose a Specific Square to Reveal**\n\nLet's choose a square that is not adjacent to any numbered tiles to minimize the risk of triggering a bomb.\n\nFor example, (0,0):\n\n- It's in the top-left corner.\n- It's not adjacent to any numbered tiles.\n\nHowever, since it's in the corner, it has only three adjacent squares, making it a low-risk move.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the analysis, the safest initial move is to reveal a square that is not adjacent to any numbered tiles, reducing the risk of hitting a bomb. Revealing (0,0) is a strategic choice as it provides new information about the board's edge, which can be used to infer the status of adjacent squares in subsequent moves.\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Revealing a corner square (0,0) that is not adjacent to any numbered tiles minimizes the risk of hitting a bomb and provides new information about the board's edge.\n\n**MOVE:** 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . 2 . 1 . . .\n5 . . . . 2 2 2 . . .\n6 . . . . 1 1 . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
