{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. The board is completely unexplored right now, with all squares as dots, meaning nothing has been revealed or flagged yet. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs placed somewhere on it. I have 10 flags remaining, which makes sense because there are 10 bombs. My goal is to either reveal all the safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs without hitting any.\n\nSince the board is completely empty, I don't have any numbers or flags to go by yet. That means I can't apply the critical flag placement rules because there's no information to base any decisions on. All the rules about making sure that a '1' doesn't have too many adjacent flags or that a '2' has exactly two bombs nearby don't apply here because I haven't revealed any numbers yet.\n\nSo, my first thought is that I should start by revealing a square to get some information. Revealing a square will either show me a number, which tells me how many bombs are adjacent to it, or it might reveal a bomb, which would end the game immediately. Since the game hasn't ended yet, I know that at least the first move won't be a bomb, but I can't be sure about that.\n\nI remember that in Minesweeper, the first click is always safe in some versions, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. The problem statement doesn't specify, so I can't assume that. Therefore, I have to proceed with caution.\n\nSince I don't have any flags placed yet, I don't have to worry about placing a flag incorrectly or removing any. My only options are to reveal a square or place a flag. But placing a flag without any information seems risky because I might be flagging a safe square, which would be a waste and could prevent me from correctly flagging actual bombs later on.\n\nTherefore, the logical step is to reveal a square to get some information. Once I reveal a square and see a number, I can start applying the rules to figure out where the bombs might be. But for now, without any data, revealing is the only way to proceed.\n\nI could choose any square to reveal, but perhaps starting from the top-left corner (0,0) is a good idea since it's a common starting point and might give me a number that could help me branch out to adjacent squares. Alternatively, maybe the center would be better because it has more adjacent squares, but in a 10x10 grid, the center is around (5,5), which is a bit far. Starting near the top might make it easier to expand.\n\nWait, but in Minesweeper, sometimes the edges have fewer adjacent squares, so maybe starting near the center would give me more information because each revealed number can affect more surrounding squares. However, since the board is empty, it might not matter much. Maybe I should just pick a random square, but perhaps (0,0) is as good as any.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to reveal a square. Let's say I choose (0,0). If it's a number, I can start deducing from there. If it's a bomb, the game ends, but I have to take that risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that since I have 10 flags, I could start by placing a flag somewhere, but without any information, that's just a guess and might be incorrect. So, it's better to reveal first.\n\nTherefore, my next move is to reveal the square at (0,0).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Since the board is completely unexplored, revealing a square will provide necessary information to proceed without risking incorrect flag placement.\n\nMOVE: 0,0,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 0, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me look at the board state provided. The board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs with 10 flags remaining. So, it's a standard setup where the number of flags equals the number of bombs.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that the top-left corner (0,0) is revealed as 1, and (0,1) is also 1. Then, (1,1) is 1 as well. The rest of the board is unexplored, all dots. So, the only revealed tiles are in the top-left area, with three 1's.\n\nFirst, I should check if there are any obvious conflicts with the existing flags. But wait, the board doesn't show any flags placed yet because all the revealed tiles are numbers, not flags. So, I don't have to worry about removing any flags right now.\n\nNext, I need to think about where to place a flag or reveal a tile. Since the goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all bombs, I should probably try to reveal more squares to get information.\n\nLooking at the revealed tiles: (0,0) is 1, which means it has exactly one adjacent bomb. Its adjacent squares are (0,1), which is 1, and (1,0), which is unexplored, and (1,1), which is 1. Wait, (0,0) is 1, so it must have exactly one bomb in its adjacent squares. Let's see: (0,1) is 1, so that's a number, not a bomb. (1,0) is unexplored, and (1,1) is 1. So, the bomb adjacent to (0,0) must be either (1,0) or another square not yet considered. But since (0,0) only has one bomb adjacent, and (0,1) is a 1, which is safe, the bomb must be in one of the other adjacent squares.\n\nSimilarly, (0,1) is 1, so it has exactly one adjacent bomb. Its adjacent squares are (0,0) which is 1, (0,2), (1,0), (1,1) which is 1, and (1,2). So, the bomb adjacent to (0,1) must be in one of these. But since (0,0) is already a 1, the bomb can't be there. So, maybe (1,0) is the bomb that satisfies both (0,0) and (0,1)'s counts.\n\nWait, but (1,1) is also 1. So, (1,1) has exactly one adjacent bomb. Its adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), and (2,1). So, the bomb adjacent to (1,1) must be in one of these. But (0,0) is 1, so it can't be a bomb. (0,1) is 1, so also not a bomb. So, the bomb could be in (1,0), (1,2), or (2,1).\n\nIf I consider that (0,0) needs a bomb adjacent, and (0,1) also needs a bomb adjacent, and (1,1) needs a bomb adjacent, perhaps the bomb is in (1,0). Because that would satisfy (0,0)'s count, (0,1)'s count, and (1,1)'s count. Let me check: If (1,0) is a bomb, then (0,0) has one bomb adjacent, which is correct. (0,1) would have (1,0) as a bomb adjacent, which is one, so that's correct. (1,1) would have (1,0) as a bomb adjacent, which is one, so that's correct. So, that seems to fit.\n\nSo, if (1,0) is a bomb, then I can flag it. That would use one of my flags, leaving me with 9 flags left, which matches the number of bombs remaining.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to reveal (1,0) to see if it's a bomb. But if I reveal it and it's a bomb, the game would end, which I don't want. So, it's safer to flag it if I'm confident.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider other possibilities. For example, maybe the bomb is in (1,2). Let's see: If (1,2) is a bomb, then (0,1) would have that as its adjacent bomb, which is one. Then, (0,0) would need a bomb adjacent, which would have to be somewhere else, maybe (1,0). But then (1,1) would have (1,2) as a bomb, which is one, so that's okay. But then (1,0) would be another bomb, which would mean that (0,0) is adjacent to two bombs: (1,0) and (1,1) is a 1, so that's a problem because (0,0) can only have one bomb adjacent. So, that scenario would cause a conflict because (0,0) would have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts it being a 1.\n\nTherefore, the only way for all the revealed 1's to be correct is if the bomb is in (1,0). So, I should place a flag there.\n\nWait, but I should also check the remaining flags. Since there are 10 bombs and 10 flags, and I'm about to place one flag, that leaves 9 flags. I need to make sure that this placement doesn't conflict with any other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a tile instead. For example, revealing (1,0) could confirm if it's a bomb, but if it is, the game ends. So, that's risky. Alternatively, I could reveal a tile that's more likely to be safe, like (2,0), but that's far from the revealed numbers.\n\nAnother approach is to look for tiles that are adjacent to multiple revealed numbers. For example, (1,0) is adjacent to both (0,0) and (0,1), which are both 1's. So, if (1,0) is a bomb, that would satisfy both. But if it's not, then those 1's would have their bombs elsewhere, which might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that (1,0) is the only tile that can satisfy all three 1's without causing conflicts. So, placing a flag there seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for other tiles to reveal. For example, revealing (0,2) could give me more information. If it's a number, that could help. But if it's a bomb, the game ends. So, it's a bit risky.\n\nI think the safest move is to place a flag at (1,0), as that seems to satisfy all the adjacent 1's without causing conflicts. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Placing a flag at (1,0) satisfies the adjacent 1's at (0,0), (0,1), and (1,1) without causing conflicts.\nMOVE: 1,0,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 . 1 . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 1, "y": 1, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the current board state and the game info.\n\nThe board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. I have 9 flags remaining, which means I can place one more flag. The board has some revealed tiles, some unexplored, and one flagged square at (1,1). \n\nLooking at the revealed tiles, I see that at (0,1) there's a 1, and at (1,0) there's an F, which is a flag. Wait, but (0,1) is a 1, so that means there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. The adjacent squares to (0,1) would be (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), and (1,1). \n\nWait, (1,0) is an F, which is a flag, so that counts as one bomb. So the 1 at (0,1) must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (1,0) is already flagged, that accounts for the one bomb, so the other adjacent squares (0,0), (0,2), and (1,1) must not have bombs. \n\nSo that means (0,0) is safe, (0,2) is safe, and (1,1) is safe. Wait, but (1,1) is currently unexplored. So maybe I can reveal that. Or perhaps I should check other areas.\n\nWait, but the flag at (1,0) is correct because the 1 at (0,1) is satisfied by that one bomb. So no conflict there. \n\nLooking elsewhere, I don't see any other numbers revealed, so maybe I should consider placing a flag somewhere else. But I have only one flag left. I need to make sure that placing a flag doesn't conflict with any revealed numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal a tile that's adjacent to a number to get more information. For example, revealing (1,1) would tell me if it's a number or not. If it's a number, that could help me figure out where other bombs are. If it's empty, that also gives me information.\n\nWait, but (0,1) is a 1, and its adjacent squares except (1,0) must be safe. So (1,1) is safe, so I can reveal that without worrying about hitting a bomb. Let me check: if I reveal (1,1), it should be safe because the 1 at (0,1) is already accounted for by the flag at (1,0). So revealing (1,1) would be safe and could give me more info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for other numbered tiles. But in the current board, only (0,1) and (1,0) are revealed. So perhaps the next step is to reveal (1,1) to see what's there. \n\nIf I reveal (1,1) and it's a number, say a 2, then I know that there are two bombs around it. But if it's empty, then I can explore further from there. Since I have flags remaining, maybe after revealing, I can place a flag elsewhere if needed.\n\nWait, but I have only one flag left, so I should be careful. Maybe I should check if any other squares could be bombs without conflicting with the existing numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total number of bombs. There are 10 bombs, and I've already placed one flag. So there are 9 bombs left to find, but I can only place one more flag. So perhaps revealing is better to get more info.\n\nSo, my plan is to reveal (1,1) because it's safe based on the 1 at (0,1). Let me see: (0,1) is a 1, and its adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), and (1,1). Since (1,0) is a flag, the other three must be safe. So (1,1) is definitely safe to reveal.\n\nTherefore, my next move is to reveal (1,1).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (1,1) is safe because the adjacent 1 at (0,1) is already satisfied by the flag at (1,0), so no other bombs are adjacent to (0,1). Revealing (1,1) will provide more information about the board without risking a mine.\n\nMOVE: 1,1,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 F 1 . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 2, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me look at the board state provided. \n\nThe board is 10x10, so it's a standard size. There are 10 bombs in total, and I've already placed one flag, leaving me with 9 flags remaining. The goal is to either reveal all safe squares or correctly flag all the bombs without hitting a mine.\n\nLooking at the current board, I see that the top row (row 0) has some revealed squares. At position (0,0), it's a 1, meaning there's one bomb adjacent to it. Next to it, (0,1) is also a 1. Then, starting from (0,2) onwards, everything is unexplored (dots). \n\nIn row 1, the first cell is an F, which is a flag I've placed. Then (1,1) is a 1, and the rest are unexplored. The rest of the rows from 2 to 9 are all unexplored, so nothing to go on there yet.\n\nI need to figure out where to place my next flag or which square to reveal. Let me think about the critical flag placement rules. \n\nFirst, I should check all the revealed numbers against existing flags for any conflicts. The number tiles must exactly match the number of bombs adjacent to them. For example, if a tile shows a 1, there must be exactly one bomb in the eight surrounding squares.\n\nLooking at (0,0) which is a 1. The adjacent squares would be (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). Since (0,1) is a 1 and (1,0) is a flag, that could mean that (1,0) is a bomb. But wait, (1,0) is a flag, so it's marked as a bomb. But (0,0) has a 1, which would mean there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. If (1,0) is a flag, then perhaps that's the bomb that (0,0) is indicating. But let me check the other adjacent squares.\n\n(0,1) is a 1, so it must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Its adjacent squares include (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2). Since (0,0) is a 1, it's already accounted for, but (1,0) is a flag. So if (1,0) is a bomb, then (0,1) would have two bombs adjacent: (1,0) and possibly another. Wait, that can't be because (0,1) is a 1. So maybe (1,0) isn't a bomb. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no. If (1,0) is a flag, it's supposed to be a bomb. But if (0,0) is a 1, then it can only have one bomb adjacent. Since (1,0) is a flag, that would be the one bomb, so (0,0)'s count is satisfied. Then (0,1) is a 1, so it must have one bomb adjacent. The possible bombs adjacent to (0,1) are (0,0), which is a 1 (so not a bomb), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2). Since (1,0) is a flag (bomb), that would make (0,1) have one bomb adjacent, which is correct. So that seems okay.\n\nBut wait, if (1,0) is a bomb, then (1,1) is a 1, which is adjacent to (1,0). So (1,1) would have a bomb in (1,0), but it's a 1, so that's correct. But then, what about (1,1)'s other adjacent squares? Let me check. (1,1) is at the second row, second column. Its adjacent squares are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2). But (0,0) and (0,1) are 1s, so they are safe. (1,0) is a flag, so a bomb. So (1,1) is a 1, meaning it has exactly one bomb adjacent. That's correct because (1,0) is the bomb.\n\nSo far, the flags and numbers seem consistent. Now, I need to decide where to go next. Since I have 9 flags left and 10 bombs, I need to place 9 more flags correctly.\n\nLooking at the board, the only revealed numbers are in the top two rows, so maybe I should focus there. Let's see, (0,0) is a 1, (0,1) is a 1, and (1,1) is a 1. The rest are unexplored.\n\nI think the next step is to reveal a square that could give me more information. Maybe revealing a square adjacent to the existing numbers could help me find where the bombs are. Alternatively, I could place a flag where I think a bomb is likely.\n\nWait, but I can't just place a flag anywhere. I have to make sure that the numbers don't contradict it. For example, if I place a flag in a square that a number says shouldn't have a bomb, that would be a conflict.\n\nLet me think about (0,2). It's unexplored. If I reveal it, maybe it's a number that can help. But if I reveal a bomb, the game ends. Alternatively, if I place a flag there, I need to make sure that the surrounding numbers allow it.\n\nWait, (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1), which is a 1. So if I place a flag at (0,2), then (0,1) would have two adjacent flags: (0,2) and (1,0) if that's a bomb. But (0,1) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. So if (1,0) is a bomb, I can't place a flag at (0,2) because that would make (0,1) have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts the 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (1,0) isn't a bomb. But I placed a flag there, so it's supposed to be a bomb. Wait, but I can remove a flag by making a move with flag=true on that square again. Maybe I made a mistake by placing a flag at (1,0). Let me check that.\n\nIf (1,0) is a flag, but the numbers around it don't support it, I might have to remove it. Let's see: (0,0) is a 1, and it's adjacent to (1,0). If (1,0) is a bomb, then (0,0) is correctly showing 1. But (0,1) is a 1, and it's adjacent to (1,0). So if (1,0) is a bomb, then (0,1) would have one bomb adjacent, which is correct. So maybe (1,0) is indeed a bomb, and my flag is correct.\n\nBut then, when I look at (1,1), which is a 1, it's adjacent to (1,0), so that's the one bomb. So that's consistent.\n\nSo perhaps I should look elsewhere. Maybe I should try to reveal a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers to get more info. For example, revealing (1,2) could help because it's adjacent to (0,1) and (1,1), both 1s.\n\nIf I reveal (1,2) and it's a number, say 2, that would indicate there are two bombs adjacent to it. But considering the current state, (1,2) is adjacent to (0,1) which is a 1, so it's safe, (1,1) which is a 1, and possibly other squares. Wait, no, (1,2) is in row 1, column 2. Its adjacent squares would be (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). But most of these are unexplored.\n\nAlternatively, revealing (2,1) might help because it's below (1,1). If (2,1) is a 1, that would mean there's a bomb adjacent to it, which could be in (2,0), (2,2), (1,0), (1,1), (3,0), (3,1), or (3,2). But since (1,0) is a flag (bomb), that might influence (2,1)'s number.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to place a flag somewhere else. Wait, I have 9 flags left, so I need to be careful. Maybe I should reveal a square that's adjacent to the existing numbers to get more clues.\n\nLet me think about the squares around the existing numbers. (0,0) is a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent. We think that's (1,0). (0,1) is a 1, which is adjacent to (1,0) as the bomb. (1,1) is a 1, adjacent to (1,0). So all these numbers are consistent with (1,0) being a bomb.\n\nSo, perhaps I should try to reveal (0,2). If I reveal it, and it's a 0, that means no bombs around it, but that's unlikely because (0,1) is a 1, so (0,2) could be a 1 or higher. Alternatively, if I reveal (0,2) and it's a 1, that would mean there's one bomb adjacent, which could be (1,2) or (0,3), etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reveal (1,2). If I reveal (1,2) and it's a 1, that would mean one bomb adjacent. But considering that (1,1) is a 1, and (1,0) is a flag, maybe (1,2) is a 1 because of a bomb in (1,3) or (2,2), etc.\n\nWait, but if I reveal (1,2) and it's a 1, that would mean one bomb adjacent. But since (1,1) is a 1, and (1,0) is a flag, perhaps (1,2) is a 1 because of a bomb in (0,2) or (2,2). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check (2,1). If I reveal (2,1) and it's a 1, that would indicate a bomb somewhere around it. But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach: since I have 10 bombs and 9 flags left, I need to find where the other bombs are. The flag at (1,0) is one bomb accounted for. So there are 9 more bombs to flag.\n\nLooking at the board, the top-left area has some numbers, but the rest is unexplored. Maybe I should try to reveal a square that's adjacent to the existing numbers to get more info.\n\nLet me consider revealing (0,2). If I click there, and it's a 1, that would mean one bomb adjacent. The possible bombs could be (0,3), (1,2), or (1,1) is a 1, but (1,1) is already a number, so it's safe. So if (0,2) is a 1, the bomb could be in (0,3) or (1,2). Alternatively, if (0,2) is a 2, that would mean two bombs adjacent, which could be (0,3) and (1,2), or (1,2) and something else.\n\nBut I don't know yet. Alternatively, revealing (1,2) could give me more info because it's adjacent to (0,1) and (1,1), both 1s.\n\nWait, if I reveal (1,2) and it's a 1, that would mean one bomb adjacent. The possible bombs could be (0,2), (1,3), (2,2), or (2,1). But (1,1) is a 1, so it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I reveal (1,2) and it's a 2, that would mean two bombs adjacent. But considering that (1,1) is a 1, which is already accounted for by (1,0), perhaps (1,2) is a 1 because of a bomb in (1,3) or (2,2).\n\nI'm not sure. Maybe I should take a different approach. Since I have flags remaining, perhaps I should look for a square that is likely to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nWait, let's think about the critical flag rules again. Rule 2 says that if a number shows '1', but already has an adjacent flag, there can't be another bomb adjacent. So, for example, (0,0) is a 1, and (1,0) is a flag. So (0,0) can't have any other bombs adjacent. That means (0,1) can't be a bomb because it's adjacent to (0,0). But (0,1) is a 1, so it's safe. Similarly, (1,1) is a 1, which is adjacent to (1,0), so that's the one bomb.\n\nSo, perhaps I can look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers, which could help me determine where the bombs are.\n\nAnother idea: since (0,0) is a 1 and (0,1) is a 1, and (1,0) is a flag, perhaps the next step is to reveal (0,2). If it's a 1, then the bomb is somewhere else, but if it's a 0, then it's safe, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to reveal (1,2). Let me think about the possible outcomes.\n\nIf I reveal (1,2) and it's a 0, that means no bombs around it, which would help me clear some squares. If it's a 1, that tells me there's one bomb around it. If it's a 2, two bombs, etc.\n\nBut I don't know yet. Maybe I should take the safer approach and reveal a square that's less likely to be a bomb, to get more info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag somewhere else. But I need to make sure that it doesn't conflict with the existing numbers.\n\nWait, let me think about the squares adjacent to the existing numbers. For example, (0,0) is a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent, which is (1,0). So (0,1) can't be a bomb because (0,0) is a 1, and (0,1) is adjacent to (0,0). Wait, no, (0,1) is a 1, so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent, which is (1,0). So the squares around (1,1) can't have any other bombs because that would make (1,1) show a higher number.\n\nSo, perhaps I can look for squares that are adjacent to multiple numbers. For example, (1,2) is adjacent to (0,1) and (1,1), both of which are 1s. So if I reveal (1,2), it could tell me if there's a bomb nearby.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to reveal (0,2). Let's say I reveal (0,2) and it's a 1. That would mean there's one bomb adjacent. The possible bombs could be (0,3), (1,2), or (1,1) is a 1, so not a bomb. So if (0,2) is a 1, the bomb is either in (0,3) or (1,2).\n\nAlternatively, if (0,2) is a 2, that would mean two bombs adjacent, which could be (0,3) and (1,2), or (1,2) and (1,3), etc.\n\nBut without knowing, it's hard to say. Maybe I should try to reveal (0,2). Let's do that.\n\nWait, but if I reveal (0,2) and it's a bomb, the game ends, which I don't want. So maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, so that revealing it could give me more information. For example, (1,2) is adjacent to (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1). If I reveal (1,2) and it's a number, that could help me understand the surrounding area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to place a flag somewhere else. Let me think about the possible locations.\n\nWait, I have 9 flags left, and I've already placed one. So I need to place 9 more. But I don't know where the other bombs are. Maybe I should focus on the top-left area since that's where the revealed numbers are.\n\nAnother idea: since (0,0) is a 1 and (1,0) is a flag, perhaps the next bomb is somewhere else. Let me think about the possible positions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that (0,1) is a 1, so it has one bomb adjacent. The possible bombs are (0,2), (1,1), or (1,0). But (1,0) is a flag, so that's the one bomb. Therefore, (0,1) can't have any other bombs adjacent. So (0,2) can't be a bomb because that would make (0,1) have two bombs adjacent, which contradicts the 1.\n\nWait, no. (0,1) is a 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. If (1,0) is a bomb, then (0,1) is satisfied. So (0,2) could be a safe square or a bomb, but if it's a bomb, then (0,1) would have two bombs adjacent, which is not allowed. Therefore, (0,2) must be safe, because (0,1) is a 1 and already has (1,0) as the bomb. So (0,2) can't be a bomb because that would make (0,1) have two bombs adjacent.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So (0,2) must be a safe square because (0,1) is a 1 and already has (1,0) as the bomb. So revealing (0,2) would be safe because it's not a bomb. So I can reveal (0,2) without worrying about hitting a mine.\n\nSo, let me make that move. I'll reveal (0,2). Since it's safe, I won't hit a bomb, and it will either show a number or be empty.\n\nIf it's a number, say 1, then I know there's one bomb adjacent to (0,2). The possible bombs would be (0,3), (1,2), or (1,1). But (1,1) is a 1, so it's safe. So the bomb would have to be in (0,3) or (1,2).\n\nAlternatively, if (0,2) is a 0, then it's empty, and I can reveal more squares around it.\n\nBut since I'm not sure, I'll proceed with revealing (0,2).\n\nWait, but the user wants the next move in the format of x,y,flag. So x is the row, y is the column. (0,2) is row 0, column 2.\n\nSo the move would be x=0, y=2, flag=false (reveal). \n\nBut wait, I just thought that (0,2) must be safe because (0,1) is a 1 and already has (1,0) as the bomb. So revealing (0,2) is safe and won't hit a bomb. Therefore, it's a good move to make to get more information.\n\nSo, I think the next move should be to reveal (0,2).\n</think>\n\nTo gather more information about the board and ensure no conflict with existing numbers, I will reveal the square at (0,2). This move is safe because (0,1) is a 1, indicating that (0,2) cannot be a bomb without conflicting with the adjacent number.\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (0,2) is safe because (0,1) is a 1, meaning it already accounts for the bomb at (1,0). Revealing (0,2) will provide more information about adjacent bombs without risking a game over.\n\nMOVE: 0,2,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 . . . . . . . .\n1 F 1 . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 2, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move in this Minesweeper game. Let me start by looking at the board state and the game info provided.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, which is standard. There are 10 bombs in total, and I have 9 flags remaining. That means I can place up to 9 flags, but since there are 10 bombs, I might need to be careful with my flag placements to avoid conflicts.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that some squares are already revealed or flagged. Let me go row by row to see where I can get some clues.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 0: [1, 1, _, _, _, _, 1, ., . , .]\nSo, in row 0, columns 0 and 1 are revealed as 1s. Column 2 to 6 are mostly unexplored except for column 6 which is 1. So, the 1s in row 0 might indicate bombs adjacent to them.\n\nRow 1: [F, 1, _, _, _, 1, 2, ., . , .]\nHere, column 0 is flagged (F). Columns 1 is 1, column 5 is 1, column 6 is 2. So, the 2 in column 6 means there are two bombs adjacent to it. Since column 0 is already flagged, maybe that's one of them, so there must be another bomb nearby.\n\nRow 2: [1, 1, _, _, _, 1, ., . , . , .]\nColumns 0 and 1 are 1s, column 5 is 1. So, similar to row 0, these 1s indicate adjacent bombs.\n\nRow 3 to 5: All are unexplored except columns 5 which are 2 in rows 3,4,5. So, each of these 2s must have exactly two bombs adjacent.\n\nRow 6: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,.,.,.]\nThis row is interesting. All columns 0 to 6 are 1s. That suggests each of these has exactly one bomb adjacent. Since they are all in a row, the bombs are probably in row 7 or row 5 or maybe spread around.\n\nRows 7 to 9 are all unexplored.\n\nNow, let me think about possible moves. The goal is to either reveal a tile or place a flag. But since I have 9 flags left and 10 bombs, I might need to place flags carefully.\n\nLooking at row 0, columns 0 and 1 are 1s. Each of these must have exactly one bomb adjacent. The adjacent squares could be in row 1 or columns beyond. But in row 1, column 0 is already flagged, which could be the bomb for row 0, column 0's 1. Similarly, row 0, column 1's 1 could have a bomb in row 1, column 1 or 2, but row 1, column 1 is a 1, which can't be a bomb. So maybe the bomb is in row 0, column 2 or row 1, column 2.\n\nBut wait, row 1, column 2 is currently unexplored. So if row 0, column 0 is 1 and column 0 is flagged, that could be the bomb it's indicating. Then, row 0, column 1's 1 must have a bomb adjacent. The possible spots are row 0, column 2; row 1, column 1 or 2. But row 1, column 1 is a 1, so it can't be a bomb. So the bomb must be in row 1, column 2 or row 0, column 2.\n\nBut row 1, column 2 is unexplored, so maybe I should check that. Alternatively, maybe I can look for other clues.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 6 is 2, which means it has two bombs adjacent. Since column 0 is flagged, that's one bomb. So there must be another bomb adjacent to row 1, column 6. The adjacent squares could be row 0, column 5 or 6; row 1, column 5 or 7; or row 2, column 5 or 6 or 7. But row 0, column 6 is 1, which can't be a bomb. So maybe the other bomb is in row 1, column 5 or 7, or row 2, column 5 or 6.\n\nBut row 1, column 5 is 1, so it can't be a bomb. So the other bomb must be in row 1, column 7 or row 2, column 5 or 6.\n\nBut row 2, column 5 is 1, so that can't be a bomb. So maybe row 2, column 6 is a possible spot. Let me check row 2, column 6: it's unexplored. So perhaps that's a bomb.\n\nWait, but row 2, column 6 is adjacent to row 1, column 6's 2, so if that's a bomb, then row 1, column 6 would have two bombs: one at column 0 and one at row 2, column 6. That would satisfy the 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me look elsewhere for more clues.\n\nLooking at row 6, all columns 0-6 are 1s. That's a lot of 1s. Each of these must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since they are in row 6, the bombs could be in row 5, row 7, or the same row (columns beyond 6). But row 7 is unexplored, so maybe the bombs are in row 5 or row 7.\n\nWait, rows 3,4,5 have column 5 as 2. So in row 3, column 5 is 2, meaning two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares could be row 2, column 4 or 5 or 6; row 3, column 4 or 6; or row 4, column 4 or 5 or 6. But row 4, column 5 is also 2, so maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nHmm, maybe I should focus on row 6, since all the 1s there could indicate a line of bombs in row 5 or 7. But row 5, column 5 is 2, so that might have two bombs around it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a spot where revealing it would give me more information. For example, if I reveal a square that's surrounded by numbers, I can get more clues.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 6 is 2, which I mentioned earlier. If I could find where the second bomb is, that would help. Maybe I can check row 2, column 6. If I reveal that, and it's a 1 or something, that could help. But if it's a bomb, the game would end, so that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's only adjacent to one number, making it safer to reveal. For example, in row 6, all the 1s are in a row. If I reveal one of them, maybe I can see if it's a bomb or not, but that's also risky.\n\nWait, another approach: since I have 9 flags left and 10 bombs, I need to place flags carefully. But maybe I can check if any of the current flags are conflicting with the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0 is flagged. Let's see if that's consistent with the numbers around it. The adjacent squares to (1,0) are:\n\n- (0,0): 1\n- (0,1): 1\n- (1,1): 1\n- (2,0): 1\n- (2,1): 1\n\nWait, that's a lot of 1s around a flag. Each of these 1s must have exactly one bomb adjacent. But if (1,0) is a flag (bomb), then each of these 1s should have that as their only bomb. But let's check:\n\n(0,0) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. Since (1,0) is a bomb, that's the one. So (0,0)'s 1 is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, (0,1) is 1. Its adjacent bombs could be (1,0) and maybe others. Wait, (0,1) is 1, so it can only have one bomb adjacent. But (1,0) is a bomb, so that's the one. So (0,1)'s 1 is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is 1. It's adjacent to (1,0), which is a bomb, so that's the one. So (1,1)'s 1 is satisfied.\n\n(2,0) is 1. It's adjacent to (1,0), which is a bomb, so that's the one. So (2,0)'s 1 is satisfied.\n\n(2,1) is 1. It's adjacent to (1,0) and (1,1). But (1,0) is a bomb, so that's the one. So (2,1)'s 1 is satisfied.\n\nSo the flag at (1,0) seems to be correctly placed because all the surrounding 1s are satisfied by it. So that flag is okay.\n\nNow, looking at row 1, column 6 is 2. It has a flag at (1,0), which is one bomb, so it needs another bomb adjacent. The possible spots are (1,5), (1,7), (0,5), (0,6), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). But (1,5) is 1, so it can't be a bomb. (0,6) is 1, so it can't be a bomb. So the other bomb must be in (1,7), (2,6), or (2,7).\n\nIf I could reveal one of these, maybe I can find the bomb. But revealing (1,7) is risky because if it's a bomb, the game ends. Alternatively, maybe I can look for other clues.\n\nLooking at row 6, all columns 0-6 are 1s. Each of these must have exactly one bomb adjacent. Since they are in row 6, the bombs could be in row 5 or row 7. But row 5, column 5 is 2, so maybe that's a clue.\n\nWait, row 5, column 5 is 2. So it has two bombs adjacent. The adjacent squares are row 4,4-6; row 5,4 and 6; row 6,4-6. But row 6,4-6 are 1s, so they can't be bombs. So the bombs must be in row 4 or 5, columns 4,5,6.\n\nBut row 5, column 5 is 2, so two bombs around it. Let me check row 5, columns 4,5,6. Column 5 is 2, so the bombs could be in row 4,5 or row 6,5. But row 6,5 is 1, so it can't be a bomb. So maybe row 4,5 is a bomb, and another one in row 5,4 or 6.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a square that's only adjacent to one number, making it safer to reveal.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 2 is unexplored, adjacent to (0,0) which is 1 and (0,1) which is 1. If I reveal (0,2), it could be a bomb or a number. If it's a number, it might help. But if it's a bomb, the game ends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 6, column 7. It's unexplored, and adjacent to row 6,6 which is 1. So if I reveal (6,7), it might be a bomb or a number. But again, risky.\n\nWait, another idea: since row 6 has all 1s from 0-6, maybe the bombs are in row 7, columns 0-6. But row 7 is unexplored, so I can't confirm that yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's surrounded by multiple numbers, so that revealing it would give me more info. For example, row 1, column 6 is 2, and it's adjacent to row 1,5 (1), row 2,5 (1), and row 2,6 (unexplored). If I reveal row 2,6, and it's a 1, that could help. But again, it's risky.\n\nWait, maybe I can place a flag somewhere. Since I have 9 flags left, and 10 bombs, I need to be careful. But perhaps I can find a spot where a flag must be placed based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0 is 1, and (1,0) is flagged. So that's good. Similarly, row 0, column 1 is 1, and the bomb is probably at (1,1) or (0,2). But (1,1) is 1, so it can't be a bomb. So the bomb must be at (0,2). Wait, but (0,2) is unexplored. So maybe I can place a flag there? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should reveal it.\n\nBut revealing (0,2) could be a bomb, which would end the game. So maybe that's not the best move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 2, column 6. If I reveal it, and it's a 1, that could help with row 1, column 6's 2. But again, it's risky.\n\nWait, another approach: let's count the number of bombs accounted for. So far, I have one flag at (1,0), so that's one bomb. There are 10 bombs in total, so 9 left. But I have 9 flags left, so I can potentially flag all the remaining bombs.\n\nBut I need to make sure that placing a flag doesn't conflict with any numbers. For example, if I place a flag where a number indicates there should be zero bombs, that's a conflict.\n\nLooking at row 6, all the 1s. Each of these must have exactly one bomb adjacent. If I could find where those bombs are, maybe I can place flags.\n\nBut without more info, it's hard. Maybe I should look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, so that revealing it would give me more info.\n\nFor example, row 1, column 6 is 2. If I could find the second bomb, that would help. The possible spots are (1,7), (2,6), (2,7). If I could reveal one of these, maybe I can find the bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 5, column 5 is 2, so it needs two bombs adjacent. The possible spots are row 4,5; row 5,4; row 5,6; row 6,5. But row 6,5 is 1, so it can't be a bomb. So the bombs must be in row 4,5 or row 5,4 or 6.\n\nWait, but row 4,5 is 2, so that's another 2. So maybe row 4,5 is a bomb, and another one nearby.\n\nThis is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should focus on a specific area where I can get more info with less risk.\n\nLooking back at row 0, columns 0 and 1 are 1s, and (1,0) is flagged. So the bomb for (0,1)'s 1 must be in (0,2) or (1,1) or (1,2). But (1,1) is 1, so it can't be a bomb. So the bomb is either (0,2) or (1,2).\n\nIf I could reveal (0,2), I could confirm if it's a bomb or not. But revealing it is risky. Alternatively, maybe I can look at (1,2). If I reveal (1,2), and it's a 1, that might help. But again, it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 6, column 7. It's adjacent to row 6,6 which is 1. So if I reveal (6,7), and it's a bomb, the game ends. But if it's a number, that could help.\n\nWait, another idea: since row 6 has all 1s from 0-6, maybe the bombs are in row 7, columns 0-6. So each of these 1s in row 6 must have exactly one bomb in row 7. So, for example, (6,0) is 1, so (7,0) must be a bomb. Similarly, (6,1) is 1, so (7,1) is a bomb, and so on up to (6,6) which would have (7,6) as a bomb.\n\nBut that would mean 7 bombs in row 7, columns 0-6. But there are only 10 bombs in total, and we've already used one at (1,0), so 9 left. So 7 in row 7 would leave 2 more bombs elsewhere. That could be possible.\n\nIf that's the case, then I can place flags in row 7, columns 0-6. But I can't place all 7 flags at once, but maybe I can start placing them one by one.\n\nBut wait, I have 9 flags left, and if I place 7 in row 7, that would leave 2 more flags. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should test this hypothesis.\n\nIf I place a flag at (7,0), but I can't be sure if it's a bomb. If I place a flag there, and it's not a bomb, that would be a conflict because (6,0) is 1, expecting exactly one bomb adjacent. So if (7,0) is not a bomb, then the bomb must be elsewhere, like (5,0) or (6,1), but (6,1) is 1, so it can't be a bomb.\n\nWait, no, (6,1) is 1, so it needs exactly one bomb adjacent. So if (7,0) is a bomb, then (6,0)'s 1 is satisfied, and (6,1)'s 1 would need a bomb adjacent, which could be (7,1) or (5,1) or (6,0) or (6,2). But (6,0) is 1, not a bomb, so the bomb for (6,1) must be elsewhere.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to find a square that's adjacent to multiple numbers, so that revealing it would give me more info.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 6 is 2. It's adjacent to (1,5)=1, (1,7), (0,5), (0,6)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,6), (2,7). So, the two bombs must be among these, but (1,5) and (0,6) are 1s, so they can't be bombs. So the bombs must be in (1,7), (2,6), or (2,7).\n\nIf I could reveal (2,6), and it's a 1, that would mean it's adjacent to one bomb. But (2,6) is adjacent to (1,6)=2, which already has one bomb at (1,0), so if (2,6) is a 1, then the other bomb for (1,6) must be at (1,7) or (2,5) or (2,7). But (2,5) is 1, so it can't be a bomb. So the bomb would be at (1,7) or (2,7).\n\nAlternatively, if (2,6) is a bomb, then (1,6)'s 2 is satisfied with (1,0) and (2,6). But then (2,6) being a bomb would affect the numbers around it, like (2,5)=1, which would have to have exactly one bomb adjacent. So (2,5)=1 would need a bomb at (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (3,5), or (3,4). But (2,6) is a bomb, so that's one. So (2,5)=1 is satisfied.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to reveal (2,6). If it's a bomb, game over. If it's a number, I get more info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's only adjacent to one number, making it safer to reveal. For example, row 3, column 5 is 2. It's adjacent to row 2,4-6; row 3,4 and 6; row 4,4-6. Maybe revealing one of these could help, but it's still risky.\n\nWait, another idea: since row 6 has all 1s, maybe the bombs are in row 7. So, for example, (6,0)=1 must have a bomb in (7,0). Similarly, (6,1)=1 must have a bomb in (7,1), and so on up to (6,6)=1 needing a bomb in (7,6). That would account for 7 bombs. Plus the one at (1,0), that's 8 bombs. So there are 2 more bombs somewhere.\n\nIf that's the case, then I can start placing flags in row 7, columns 0-6. But I have 9 flags left, so I can place 7 there and have 2 more. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bombs in row 7 are not all in columns 0-6, but spread out. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nMaybe I should take a chance and place a flag somewhere. Let's see, if I place a flag at (7,0), but I'm not sure if it's a bomb. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's adjacent to a 1 and see if it's a bomb.\n\nWait, row 0, column 2 is adjacent to two 1s: (0,0) and (0,1). So if I reveal (0,2), it could be a bomb or a number. If it's a bomb, the game ends. If it's a number, say 2, that would mean there are two bombs adjacent, which would have to be somewhere else.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 6 is 2. It needs two bombs. One is at (1,0), so the other must be nearby. If I could find where that other bomb is, it would help.\n\nWait, row 2, column 6 is adjacent to row 1,6=2 and row 2,5=1. So if row 2,6 is a bomb, then row 1,6's 2 is satisfied (with (1,0) and (2,6)), and row 2,5=1 would have its bomb at (2,6). That makes sense.\n\nSo maybe (2,6) is a bomb. If I place a flag there, that would satisfy both row 1,6's 2 and row 2,5's 1. But I'm not sure if (2,6) is a bomb. Alternatively, I could reveal it, but that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 3, column 5=2. It needs two bombs. The possible spots are row 2,4-6; row 3,4 and 6; row 4,4-6. Maybe one of these is a bomb.\n\nBut without more info, it's hard. Maybe I should focus on row 6 again. If I place a flag at (7,0), and it's a bomb, then (6,0)=1 is satisfied. But if it's not a bomb, then I've made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is only adjacent to one number, so that revealing it would be safer. For example, row 9, column 9 is unexplored, but it's only adjacent to row 8,8 and 9,8. Since those are unexplored, revealing (9,9) might not give much info, but it's safer.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should take a chance and reveal a square that could give me more info, even if it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that is adjacent to multiple numbers, so that revealing it would affect multiple counts. For example, row 1, column 6=2 is adjacent to several squares. If I reveal (2,6), and it's a bomb, then row 1,6's 2 is satisfied, and row 2,5=1 is also satisfied. But if it's a number, say 1, then I know there's another bomb nearby.\n\nBut again, it's risky because if it's a bomb, the game ends.\n\nWait, another approach: let's count the number of bombs that must be placed based on the numbers.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Row 0: two 1s\n- Row 1: three 1s and one 2\n- Row 2: three 1s\n- Rows 3-5: three 2s\n- Row 6: seven 1s\n\nEach number indicates the count of bombs in adjacent squares. So, for example, each 1 in row 0 must have exactly one bomb adjacent.\n\nBut it's hard to count all the bombs without more info.\n\nMaybe I should try to place a flag where it's most likely to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at row 6, all 1s. If each of these must have a bomb adjacent, and considering that row 7 is unexplored, maybe the bombs are in row 7. So, for example, (6,0)=1 must have a bomb at (7,0). Similarly, (6,1)=1 must have a bomb at (7,1), etc.\n\nIf that's the case, then placing flags in row 7, columns 0-6 would satisfy the 1s in row 6. But I can't be sure, but maybe I can try placing one flag there and see.\n\nSo, for example, placing a flag at (7,0). If it's a bomb, then (6,0)=1 is satisfied. If not, then I have to remove the flag, but according to the rules, I can remove a flag by making a move with flag=true on an already flagged square.\n\nBut since I don't know, maybe I can try that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a square that's only adjacent to one number, making it safer to reveal.\n\nWait, row 0, column 9 is unexplored, and it's only adjacent to row 0,8 and row 1,8 and 9. But since those are unexplored, revealing (0,9) might not help much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at row 9, column 0. It's only adjacent to row 8,0 and row 9,1. But again, unexplored.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should take a chance and reveal a square that's adjacent to a 1, to see if it's a bomb or not.\n\nFor example, revealing (0,2). It's adjacent to (0,0)=1 and (0,1)=1. If it's a bomb, the game ends. If it's a number, say 2, that would mean there are two bombs adjacent, which would have to be in other squares.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can reveal (2,6). If it's a bomb, then row 1,6=2 is satisfied, and row 2,5=1 is satisfied. If it's a number, then I can get more info.\n\nI think I'll go with revealing (2,6) because it's adjacent to two numbers: row 1,6=2 and row 2,5=1. If it's a bomb, the game ends, but if it's a number, it could help.\n\nSo, my move would be to reveal (2,6).\n</think>\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealing (2,6) to check if it's a bomb, which would satisfy row 1,6's 2 and row 2,5's 1. If it's a number, it provides more information about adjacent bombs.\n\nMOVE: 2,6,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n1 F 1 _ _ _ 1 2 . . .\n2 1 1 _ _ _ 1 . . . .\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 2 . . . .\n4 _ _ _ _ _ 2 . . . .\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 2 . . . .\n6 1 1 1 1 1 1 . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
