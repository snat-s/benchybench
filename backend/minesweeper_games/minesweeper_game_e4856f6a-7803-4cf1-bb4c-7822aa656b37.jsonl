Since no squares have been revealed yet, my first move should be to reveal a square. With a 10\u00d710 board and only 10 bombs, there's a 90% chance any given square is safe.\n\nA good strategy for the first move in Minesweeper is to click near the center of the board, as this maximizes the chances of opening up a large area if we hit an empty square.\n\nEXPLANATION: The board is completely unexplored. I'll make my first move near the center of the board (position 4,4) to maximize the chances of opening up a large area.

In row 8, column 6, there's a '2' with only one adjacent unexplored square at (8,7), which must contain a bomb. Also, in row 7, column 7, there's a '3' with exactly three unexplored adjacent squares at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,9), meaning all three must contain bombs. Looking at row 6, column 8, there's a '2' which already has bombs at (7,8) and (6,9) accounted for.
