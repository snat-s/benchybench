{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 0, "y": 1, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "To analyze the current board state, let's look at the revealed numbers and their adjacent spaces. Here's the relevant information based on what we have:\n\n1. Numbers on the board:\n   - (0, 0): 1 (Adjacent to (1,0), (1,1))\n   - (1, 0): 2 (Adjacent to (0,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1))\n   - (1, 1): 2 (Adjacent to (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2))\n\n2. Current flag placements: There are no flags placed yet.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- For (0, 0) with 1 adjacent bomb, the adjacent tiles are (0, 1) and (1, 0). Since (1, 0) has '2', this means there is one bomb at (1, 0) or (0, 1).\n- For (1, 0) indicating '2', it means there are exactly two bombs in adjacent tiles, which are (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), and (2, 1). Since (0, 0) is already revealed, the bombs must come from (1, 1) and one of (2, 0) or (2, 1).\n- Similarly, (1, 1) also indicates '2' and is adjacent to many tiles, solidifying our flags in the area.\n\nNext, we analyze if we should place flags or reveal tiles. Revealing (0, 1) will provide more information, but let\u2019s check for necessary flags.\n\n1. The numbers show there are 2 bombs adjacent to (1, 0) and (1, 1). Since they need to account for the 1s and must be placed adjacent to them, we can assume that (1, 1) and (2, 1) are strong candidates.\n2. At least 1 flag will be necessary to satisfy (1, 0), (1, 1) and possibly others in (2, 0) or (2, 1).\n\nHowever, although we could assert some flags here, the current board's situation tends to lean towards revealing (0, 1). So, let's reveal that space first.\n\nEXPLANATION: I will reveal (0, 1) to gain more information and clarify the situation regarding potential bomb placements.\nMOVE: 0,1,false", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 1 . . . . . . . . .\n1 2 2 . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
