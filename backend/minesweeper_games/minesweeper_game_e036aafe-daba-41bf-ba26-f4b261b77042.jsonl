Looking at the board, we can see that the tile at (8,0) has a high probability of being safe because it is adjacent to a tile with a number '1' and there is already a flag nearby. However, we can't be certain about this tile. A safer option would be to reveal a tile that is farther away from the flags and has no adjacent numbers indicating a bomb. The tile at (8,9) seems like a good option.\n\nMOVE: 8,9,false", "flags_remaining": 0, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 F 1 2 F 1 _ _ _ F _\n3 F 1 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 1\n4 F 1 F 2 1 F _ _ 1 F\n5 1 2 .
