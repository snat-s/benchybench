{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 4, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a Minesweeper game board. Let me analyze the current state of the board to determine my next move.\n\nFirst, let me make some observations about the board:\n- The board is 10x10 \n- 10 bombs total, 10 flags remaining (so I haven't used any flags yet)\n- There are no flags currently placed on the board\n\nLet me analyze the revealed numbers and see if I can determine any safe moves or where I should place flags:\n\nStarting from the top-left of the revealed area:\n\nRow 0: We have a \"1\" at (0,2), which means there's 1 bomb in the 8 adjacent cells. The cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) are already revealed and don't have bombs (they're either empty or have numbers). The cells (0,3), (1,3) are unexplored. At least one of these must contain a bomb.\n\nRow 1: We have a \"1\" at (1,2) and a \"1\" at (1,6), and a \"2\" at (1,7). The \"1\" at (1,2) is adjacent to the same unexplored cells as the \"1\" at (0,2) above. The \"1\" at (1,6) means one of its adjacent cells has a bomb. The \"2\" at (1,7) means two of its adjacent cells have bombs.\n\nRow 2: We have a \"2\" at (2,1), a \"1\" at (2,2), and a \"1\" at (2,6). \n\nRow 3: We have a \"1\" at (3,1) and a \"2\" at (3,6).\n\nRow 4: We have a \"1\" at (4,1) and a \"1\" at (4,6).\n\nRow 5: We have a \"1\" at (5,1), two \"1\"s at (5,2) and (5,3), and a \"1\" at (5,6).\n\nRow 6: We have a \"1\" at (6,3), a \"1\" at (6,5), and a \"2\" at (6,6).\n\nRow 7: We have a \"2\" at (7,3), a \"1\" at (7,4), and a \"2\" at (7,5).\n\nLet me try to find some definite bomb locations based on the number constraints:\n\nLooking at (0,2) and (1,2), both have a value of \"1\", and they share two unexplored cells at (0,3) and (1,3). Since both numbers are \"1\", and they share these two unexplored cells, one of these unexplored cells must contain a bomb. But we can't determine which one yet.\n\nLet's look at (2,1) with a value of \"2\". The adjacent unexplored cells are (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0). Since the value is \"2\", and there are 3 unexplored cells, at least two of these must contain bombs.\n\nLet's look at (3,1) with a value of \"1\". The adjacent unexplored cells are (2,0), (3,0), and (4,0). Since (2,1) already indicates that at least two of (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0) contain bombs, if we assume (2,0) and (3,0) are the ones with bombs (to satisfy (2,1)), then (3,1) with a value of \"1\" would be inconsistent. So, it's more likely that the two bombs for (2,1) are at (1,0) and (3,0).\n\nLet's look at (4,1) with a value of \"1\". The adjacent unexplored cells are (3,0), (4,0), and (5,0). If (3,0) already has a bomb (as reasoned above), then (4,0) and (5,0) cannot have bombs to satisfy (4,1).\n\nLet's look at (5,1) with a value of \"1\". The adjacent unexplored cells are (4,0), (5,0), and (6,0). If neither (4,0) nor (5,0) has a bomb (as reasoned above), then (6,0) must have a bomb.\n\nBut wait, this is getting a bit complex and I might be making mistakes. Let me revisit and do a more systematic analysis:\n\nI'll focus on the unexplored cells at the boundary and see if I can determine their safety or danger.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nFor (0,3), it's adjacent to the revealed cells (0,2) and (1,2), both with a value of \"1\", and they don't have any other unexplored adjacent cells except (1,3). So, one of (0,3) or (1,3) must have a bomb.\n\nFor (1,3), it's adjacent to the revealed cells (1,2) and (2,2), which have values of \"1\", and also the revealed cells (0,2) and (0,3), which have a value of \"1\". As mentioned above, one of (0,3) or (1,3) must have a bomb.\n\nActually, this approach is also getting complex.\n\nLet me focus on a simple heuristic: if a revealed number has exactly the right number of unexplored adjacent cells as its value, then all those unexplored cells must contain bombs.\n\nLet's see if there are any such cases:\n\nThe \"1\" at (0,2) has two unexplored adjacent cells: (0,3) and (1,3). Since 1 < 2, I can't determine yet.\n\nThe \"1\" at (1,2) also has these same two unexplored cells. Since 1 < 2, I can't determine yet.\n\nThe \"1\" at (1,6) has unexplored cells (0,5), (0,6), (1,5), and (2,5). Since 1 < 4, I can't determine yet.\n\nLet me continue this analysis...\n\nActually, I'm going to take a different approach. Let me examine regions of the board where there's a convergence of revealed numbers and see if I can deduce any safe or unsafe tiles.\n\nLooking at the region around (3,3) and (3,4), I see:\n- (3,2) is unexplored\n- (2,3) and (2,4) are unexplored\n- (3,3) and (3,4) are unexplored\n- (4,3) and (4,4) are unexplored\n- (5,4) is unexplored\n\nThe revealed numbers nearby are:\n- (2,2) with a value of \"1\"\n- (3,1) with a value of \"1\"\n- (4,1) with a value of \"1\"\n- (5,3) with a value of \"1\"\n- (3,5) with a value of \"2\"\n\nSince (2,2) has a value of \"1\", and the only unexplored adjacent cells are (1,3), (2,3), and (3,2), one of these must have a bomb. But (1,3) is also adjacent to (1,2) with a value of \"1\", and to (0,2) with a value of \"1\". This suggests (1,3) might have a bomb.\n\nOh wait, another approach is to look at chorded cells. If a revealed number has exactly the same number of unexplored adjacent cells as its value, I can flag all of them.\n\nLet me see if I can identify any clear safe zones or certain bomb locations:\n\nActually, I think (2,0) is a bomb for sure. Why? Because:\n- (2,1) has a value of \"2\", adjacent to unexplored cells (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0).\n- (3,1) has a value of \"1\", adjacent to unexplored cells (2,0), (3,0), and (4,0).\n\nIf (2,0) and (3,0) are both bombs, then (3,1) would be adjacent to 2 bombs, but it's a \"1\". If (1,0) and (3,0) are both bombs, then (3,1) would still be adjacent to 1 bomb, which is consistent. If (1,0) and (2,0) are both bombs, then (3,1) would be adjacent to 1 bomb, which is also consistent.\n\nActually, I think I've been overcomplicating this. Let me review the rules and try to make a move based on the clear constraints.\n\nIt looks like we have some 1 values near the top-right of the board, specifically at (0,7) and (2,6). The \"1\" at (0,7) is adjacent to the unexplored cell (0,6), so there's a bomb there.\n\nHmm, but (0,6) is also adjacent to (1,6), which has a value of \"1\". And the unexplored cells adjacent to (1,6) are (0,5), (0,6), (1,5), and (2,5). If (0,6) is a bomb, then none of (0,5), (1,5), or (2,5) can be bombs to satisfy (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, the \"1\" at (2,6) is adjacent to the unexplored cell (2,5), and the unexplored cells adjacent to (2,6) are (1,5), (2,5), and (3,5). So, (2,5) might be a bomb.\n\nActually, wait, let me pivot again. I think I'm overcomplicating things by looking at adjacent tiles with the same number. \n\nI think a more methodical approach would be:\n1. Identify constraints (revealed numbers and their adjacent unexplored cells).\n2. Work out possible combinations of bomb positions that satisfy these constraints.\n3. If all combinations place a bomb in a specific position, then that position definitely has a bomb. If no combinations place a bomb in a specific position, then that position is safe.\n\nI think there's a bomb at (0,3). The \"1\" at (0,2) indicates there's one bomb in the adjacent cells, and the only unexplored cells adjacent to it are (0,3) and (1,3). If (1,3) were the bomb, then the \"1\" at (1,2) would have two adjacent bombs (at (1,3) and elsewhere), which is inconsistent. So, (0,3) must be the bomb.\n\nOn second thought, I think I've overcomplicated my analysis. Let's simplify.\n\nI think (0,3) might be a safe reveal. Why? Because if (0,3) were a bomb, then the \"1\" at (0,2) would be satisfied. But then, the \"1\" at (1,2) would only be satisfied if there's a bomb at (1,3) or elsewhere. But if there's a bomb at (1,3), then the \"1\" at (0,2) would have two adjacent bombs, which is inconsistent. So, (0,3) cannot be a bomb and is safe to reveal.\n\nWait, I think I'm making logical errors. Let me restart and be more methodical:\n\nIf (0,3) is a bomb, then:\n- The \"1\" at (0,2) is satisfied.\n- The \"1\" at (1,2) would need another bomb in its adjacent unexplored cells, which are (1,3), (2,3), and (2,4).\n\nIf (1,3) is a bomb, then:\n- The \"1\" at (0,2) is satisfied through its adjacency to (1,3).\n- The \"1\" at (1,2) is satisfied.\n\nSo both scenarios seem consistent, and I can't determine for sure which one is correct.\n\nLet's analyze another part of the board.\n\nI'm going to focus on the bottom-right revealed region, around (7,3), (7,4), and (7,5). The \"2\" at (7,3) is adjacent to the unexplored cells (6,2), (7,2), and (8,2), (8,3), and (8,4). Two of these must be bombs. The \"1\" at (7,4) is adjacent to the unexplored cells (6,4), (8,3), (8,4), and (8,5). One of these must be a bomb. The \"2\" at (7,5) is adjacent to the unexplored cells (6,4), (6,5), (8,4), (8,5), and (8,6). Two of these must be bombs.\n\nGiven the constraints, I think (8,4) is a bomb. Why? If (8,4) is not a bomb, then the \"2\" at (7,3) would need two bombs from (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), and (8,3). Similarly, the \"2\" at (7,5) would need two bombs from (6,4), (6,5), (8,5), and (8,6). But then, the \"1\" at (7,4) would be inconsistent because it would have bombs from both sides. So, (8,4) is very likely a bomb.\n\nI think flagging (8,4) is a reasonable move.\n\nActually, wait. I think there's a bomb at (6,4). Let's see the contraints:\n- The \"1\" at (6,3) is adjacent to the unexplored cells (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), and (7,2).\n- The \"1\" at (6,5) is adjacent to the unexplored cells (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), and (7,6).\n- The \"2\" at (6,6) is adjacent to the unexplored cells (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), and (7,6).\n\nThe \"1\" at (6,3) and the \"1\" at (6,5) share only one unexplored cell: (6,4). For both to be satisfied without exceeding the \"1\" constraint, (6,4) must be a bomb. So, I'm very confident that (6,4) is a bomb. I think this is the most robust move, to flag (6,4). So I'm going to flag (6,4).\n\nMOVE: 6,4,true\n</think>\n# Analysis of Minesweeper Board\n\nLooking at the current board state, I need to find a safe move or identify a definite bomb location.\n\nI'm focusing on the area around coordinates (6,3) and (6,5), which both have a value of \"1\". These two numbered tiles share only one common unexplored neighbor: the square at (6,4).\n\n- The \"1\" at (6,3) indicates exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells\n- The \"1\" at (6,5) also indicates exactly one bomb in its adjacent cells\n- These two numbered tiles share only one unexplored cell at (6,4)\n\nSince both tiles need to have exactly one bomb adjacent to them, and they only share one unexplored cell, that cell at (6,4) must contain a bomb. Otherwise, we'd create a contradiction where at least one of these \"1\" tiles would end up adjacent to either zero bombs or more than one bomb.\n\nEXPLANATION: The tile at (6,4) must be a bomb because it's the only common unexplored neighbor between two \"1\" tiles at (6,3) and (6,5).\nMOVE: 6,4,true", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 . .\n2 . 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . . .\n3 . 1 _ _ _ _ 2 . . .\n4 . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n5 . 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . .\n6 . . . 1 _ 1 2 . . .\n7 . . . 2 1 2 . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 6, "y": 2, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "<think>\nLet me analyze the current board state and find the safest move.\n\nFirst, I need to identify and check all revealed numbers against existing flags to ensure there are no conflicts.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see:\n- Number 1 at (0,2): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (1,2): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (1,6): No adjacent flags\n- Number 2 at (1,7): No adjacent flags\n- Number 2 at (2,1): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (2,2): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (2,6): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (3,1): No adjacent flags\n- Number 2 at (3,6): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (4,1): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (4,6): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (5,1): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (5,2): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (5,3): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (5,6): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (6,3): Adjacent to one flag at (6,4)\n- Number 1 at (6,5): Adjacent to one flag at (6,4)\n- Number 2 at (6,6): No adjacent flags\n- Number 2 at (7,3): No adjacent flags\n- Number 1 at (7,4): No adjacent flags\n- Number 2 at (7,5): No adjacent flags\n\nLooking at the positions with flags:\n- Flag at (6,4): Adjacent to (6,3) with number 1 and (6,5) with number 1, so this is consistent\n\nSo far, there don't appear to be any conflicts with the existing flag.\n\nNow, let's look for positions where we can be certain about bombs or safe spaces:\n\n1. Let's look at the number 2 at (6,6):\n   - Adjacent unexplored spaces: (5,5), (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7)\n   - It needs 2 bombs nearby but has no flags yet, so I need to be careful.\n\n2. Similarly, the number 2 at (7,3):\n   - Adjacent unexplored spaces: (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)\n   - It needs 2 bombs nearby but has no flags yet.\n\n3. Number 2 at (7,5):\n   - Adjacent unexplored spaces: (6,7), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n   - It needs 2 bombs nearby but has no flags yet.\n\n4. Number 2 at (1,7):\n   - Adjacent unexplored spaces: (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,7), (2,8)\n   - It needs 2 bombs nearby but has no flags yet.\n\nLet me try to find some safe moves by looking at satisfied numbers:\n\n1. The number 1 at (6,3) and the number 1 at (6,5) both have their bombs accounted for with the flag at (6,4). So their other adjacent unexplored cells should be safe.\n   - For (6,3), that would be (5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (7,2)\n   - But (5,2) and (5,3) are already revealed and have numbers 1 each\n   - So (6,2) and (7,2) should be safe\n\n2. The number 1 at (7,4) has adjacent unexplored spaces at (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). Based on the information so far, I don't know which one might contain a bomb.\n\nI also need to consider that there are 10 bombs total, and only 1 has been flagged. So we still have 9 bombs to identify.\n\nLet me check for more constrained scenarios:\n\nLooking at the boundary between revealed and unexplored cells, I notice:\n- In the top-left region, there's a revealed number 1 at (0,2). It has adjacent unexplored spaces at (0,1) and possibly (0,0) and (1,1). I don't have enough information to determine which one has a bomb.\n\nGiven that (6,2) and (7,2) should be safe based on the numbers at (6,3) and (6,5) already accounting for the flagged bomb at (6,4), I think the safest move is to reveal either (6,2) or (7,2).\n\nLet's go with revealing (6,2).\n\nActually, I should double-check this logic:\n- The number 1 at (6,3) has adjacent cells: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n- Of these, (6,4) is already flagged, and (5,2), (5,3), (7,3), and (7,4) are revealed\n- So the only unexplored, unflagged cells are (5,4), (6,2), and (7,2)\n- Since (6,3) shows a 1 and we already have 1 flag adjacent to it, none of these unexplored cells should contain a bomb\n\nSo revealing (6,2) should be safe.\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let me check the adjacency of (6,3) more precisely:\n- The number 1 at (6,3) has adjacent cells: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n- Looking at the board, (5,2) shows a 1, (5,3) shows a 1, (6,4) is flagged, (7,3) shows a 2, and (7,4) shows a 1\n- So (5,4), (6,2), and (7,2) are unexplored and unflagged\n\nSince (6,3) shows a 1 and already has one flagged bomb adjacent to it (at (6,4)), the cells (5,4), (6,2), and (7,2) must be safe.\n\nSo revealing (6,2) is indeed a safe move.\n\nActually, let me double-check the adjacency one more time, carefully:\n- Position (6,3) with number 1 is adjacent to:\n  - (5,2): Revealed with number 1\n  - (5,3): Revealed with number 1\n  - (5,4): Unexplored\n  - (6,2): Unexplored\n  - (6,4): Flagged\n  - (7,2): Unexplored\n  - (7,3): Revealed with number 2\n  - (7,4): Revealed with number 1\n\nSince (6,3) shows a 1 and already has one flag adjacent to it (at (6,4)), the cells (5,4), (6,2), and (7,2) must be safe.\n\nSo revealing (6,2) is a safe move.\n\nActually, I think I've been misreading the board. Let me try to understand it again.\n\nThe board is:\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 . .\n2 . 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . . .\n3 . 1 _ _ _ _ 2 . . .\n4 . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n5 . 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . .\n6 . . . 1 F 1 2 . . .\n7 . . . 2 1 2 . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n\nLet me parse this carefully. The first coordinate is the row, and the second is the column.\n\nSo position (6,3) means the cell in row 6, column 3, which has a value of 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n- (5,2): value 1\n- (5,3): value 1\n- (5,4): unexplored\n- (6,2): unexplored\n- (6,4): flagged\n- (7,2): unexplored\n- (7,3): value 2\n- (7,4): value 1\n\nThe number 1 at (6,3) means there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. There's already a flag at (6,4), which means that's where the bomb is. Therefore, the other adjacent unexplored cells\u2014(5,4), (6,2), and (7,2)\u2014must be safe.\n\nSo revealing (6,2) is a safe move.\n\nActually, let me double check one more time with the correct adjacency:\n- Position (6,3) with number 1 is adjacent to:\n  - (5,2): This is actually out of bounds for (6,3), as it's not adjacent\n  - (5,3): value 1\n  - (5,4): unexplored\n  - (6,2): unexplored\n  - (6,4): flagged\n  - (7,2): unexplored\n  - (7,3): value 2\n  - (7,4): value 1\n\nWait, I'm getting confused by the coordinates. Let me use a different approach.\n\nI'll use (row, column) coordinates to refer to the board, where row 0 is at the top and column 0 is at the left.\n\nLooking at the cell with a number 1 at row 6, column 3:\n- Adjacent cells are:\n  - (5,2): value 1\n  - (5,3): value 1\n  - (5,4): unexplored\n  - (6,2): unexplored\n  - (6,4): flagged\n  - (7,2): unexplored\n  - (7,3): value 2\n  - (7,4): value 1\n\nThe cell at (6,3) has a value of 1, meaning there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. There's already a flag at (6,4), which means all other adjacent unexplored cells must be safe.\n\nSo revealing (6,2) is a safe move.\n\nActually, I realize I should be looking at the board from another perspective to better understand the adjacency.\n\nLet's rewrite the board with coordinates:\n```\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0   . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1   . . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 . .\n2   . 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . . .\n3   . 1 _ _ _ _ 2 . . .\n4   . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n5   . 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . .\n6   . . . 1 F 1 2 . . .\n7   . . . 2 1 2 . . . .\n8   . . . . . . . . . .\n9   . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n\nFocusing on the cell at (6,3) (row 6, column 3) which has a value of 1:\n- Adjacent cells are:\n  - (5,2): This is outside the adjacency of (6,3)\n  - (5,3): This is adjacent and has a value of 1\n  - (5,4): This is adjacent and is unexplored\n  - (6,2): This is adjacent and is unexplored\n  - (6,4): This is adjacent and is flagged\n  - (7,2): This is adjacent and is unexplored\n  - (7,3): This is adjacent and has a value of 2\n  - (7,4): This is adjacent and has a value of 1\n\nActually, wait. Let me be even more explicit. The cells adjacent to (6,3) are:\n- (5,2): This is NOT adjacent to (6,3) because it's not in a neighboring row and column\n- (5,3): This is adjacent and has a value of 1\n- (5,4): This is NOT adjacent to (6,3) because it's not in a neighboring column\n- (6,2): This is adjacent and is unexplored\n- (6,4): This is adjacent and is flagged\n- (7,2): This is NOT adjacent to (6,3) because it's not in a neighboring column\n- (7,3): This is adjacent and has a value of 2\n- (7,4): This is NOT adjacent to (6,3) because it's not in a neighboring row and column\n\nSo the adjacent cells to (6,3) are (5,3), (6,2), (6,4), and (7,3). Of these, (6,4) is flagged, which accounts for the 1 bomb indicated by the number 1 at (6,3). So (5,3), (6,2), and (7,3) must be safe.\n\nBut wait, (5,3) and (7,3) are already revealed with values 1 and 2 respectively, which means they're safe anyway. So the only unexplored, adjacent cell to (6,3) that must be safe is (6,2).\n\nSo revealing (6,2) is a safe move.\n\nActually, I think I misunderstood adjacency. Adjacent means neighboring cells in any of the 8 directions: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals.\n\nSo for the cell at (6,3), the adjacent cells are:\n- (5,2): This is adjacent diagonally (up-left)\n- (5,3): This is adjacent (up)\n- (5,4): This is adjacent diagonally (up-right)\n- (6,2): This is adjacent (left)\n- (6,4): This is adjacent (right) and is flagged\n- (7,2): This is adjacent diagonally (down-left)\n- (7,3): This is adjacent (down)\n- (7,4): This is adjacent diagonally (down-right)\n\nNow I need to check the values of these cells on the board:\n- (5,2): This contains a 1\n- (5,3): This contains a 1\n- (5,4): This is unexplored\n- (6,2): This is unexplored\n- (6,4): This is flagged\n- (7,2): This is unexplored\n- (7,3): This contains a 2\n- (7,4): This contains a 1\n\nThe cell at (6,3) has a value of 1, meaning there's exactly one bomb adjacent to it. There's already a flag at (6,4), which means all other adjacent unexplored cells must be safe.\n\nSo the cells (5,4), (6,2), and (7,2) must be safe.\n\nTherefore, revealing (6,2) is a safe move.\n</think>\n# Minesweeper Analysis\n\nLooking at the board carefully, I can identify a safe move by analyzing the positions where numbers have their adjacent bombs fully accounted for.\n\nThe key insight is at position (6,3) which shows a \"1\", meaning it has exactly one bomb in its eight adjacent cells. This bomb is already flagged at position (6,4). Since the cell at (6,3) has exactly one adjacent bomb and that bomb is already flagged, all other adjacent unexplored cells must be safe.\n\nThe unexplored cells adjacent to (6,3) are:\n- (5,4)\n- (6,2)\n- (7,2)\n\nAny of these would be safe to reveal, but I'll choose (6,2).\n\nEXPLANATION: Position (6,3) shows \"1\" and already has its one bomb flagged at (6,4), making all other adjacent unexplored cells safe.\nMOVE: 6,2,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . .\n1 . . 1 _ _ _ 1 2 . .\n2 . 2 1 _ _ _ 1 . . .\n3 . 1 _ _ _ _ 2 . . .\n4 . 1 _ _ _ _ 1 . . .\n5 . 1 1 1 _ _ 1 . . .\n6 . . . 1 F 1 2 . . .\n7 . . . 2 1 2 . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": false}
