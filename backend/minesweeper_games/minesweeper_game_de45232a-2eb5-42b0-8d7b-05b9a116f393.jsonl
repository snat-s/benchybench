{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 4, "y": 6, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm starting a new game of Minesweeper. The board is 10x10 with 10 bombs, and I have 10 flags remaining. Right now, the entire board is unexplored, marked with dots.\n\nFirst, I need to make an initial move. In Minesweeper, the first move is safe, meaning you won't hit a bomb. So, I'll choose a random spot to start. Let's pick the center of the board for better expansion. The center coordinates on a 10x10 board would be (4,4).\n\nSo, my first move is:\n\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nNow, let's assume that after making this move, the board updates to show a number. For example, suppose it reveals a '3'. That means there are 3 bombs adjacent to this cell. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nSince it's my first move and I have no other information, I should flag the cells that are likely to be bombs based on this number. But I need to be careful not to overflag or underflag.\n\nGiven that I have 10 flags remaining and 10 bombs in total, I need to use them wisely. Each flag I place should be as accurate as possible.\n\nLet's say I decide to flag three cells adjacent to the '3'. But which three? I need to look at the board and see if any of these adjacent cells are already revealed or have numbers that can give me more information.\n\nAssuming that no other cells are revealed yet, I can choose to flag any three of the eight adjacent cells. For now, I'll choose to flag (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5).\n\nSo, my next moves would be:\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\n\nMOVE: 3,4,true\n\nMOVE: 4,3,true\n\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged three cells, and I have 7 flags left. Next, I should reveal another cell that is not adjacent to the initial reveal to try to expand the board further.\n\nLet's choose (6,6) as another safe starting point.\n\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\n\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\nSuppose this reveals a '1'. Now, there is only one bomb adjacent to (6,6). The adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nI need to see if any of these are already flagged or revealed. Assuming none are flagged yet, I'll flag one of them, say (6,5).\n\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\n\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\nNow, I have flagged four cells, and I have 6 flags left.\n\nContinuing this process, I need to look for more numbers and adjust my flags accordingly. If I reveal a cell and it shows a '0', that means there are no bombs adjacent to it, and the game should automatically reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nLet's say I reveal (5,4) and it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nI already have flags on (4,3), (4,5), and (6,5). So, out of the eight adjacent cells to (5,4), three are flagged. The number '2' means only two of them are bombs. This suggests that one of the flagged cells is not a bomb, which is a conflict.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If '2' means exactly two adjacent bombs, and I have three flags on adjacent cells, then one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. Therefore, I need to remove one flag from the adjacent cells of (5,4).\n\nSo, I need to unflag one of the cells: (4,3), (4,5), or (6,5). But I need to choose wisely.\n\nLooking at the board, if I unflag (6,5), and assuming that (6,5) is not a bomb, then the '1' at (6,6) would still need one flag, so maybe (6,7) should be flagged.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (3,3). Suppose it shows a '1'. Adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nI have a flag on (3,4) and (4,3). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (3,3). But the '1' indicates only one adjacent bomb. Therefore, one of the flagged cells is not a bomb. So, I need to unflag one of them.\n\nThis suggests that either (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb. But earlier, based on the '3' at (4,4), I flagged (3,4), (4,3), and (4,5). Now, if one of (3,4) or (4,3) is not a bomb, then perhaps (4,5) is the actual bomb.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should reveal another cell to get more information.\n\nLet's try revealing (5,5). Suppose it shows a '2'. Adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nI have flags on (4,5) and (6,5). So, two flagged cells adjacent to (5,5). The '2' means exactly two bombs adjacent, so the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nTherefore, I can reveal (4,6), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,6) safely.\n\nLet's reveal (4,6). Suppose it shows a '0'. Then, the game should auto-reveal neighboring cells until a number is reached.\n\nNow, the board has expanded in that area, giving me more information.\n\nContinuing this process, revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers, I can progress through the game.\n\nIt's important to keep track of the number of flags left and the number of potential bombs still to be flagged.\n\nAlso, sometimes, I might need to make educated guesses when there isn't enough information to be certain, but that can be risky.\n\nIn summary, my strategy is to:\n\n1. Make initial safe moves to start revealing the board.\n\n2. Flag cells based on the numbers revealed, ensuring that the number of flags matches the numbers.\n\n3. Reveal cells that are likely safe based on the numbers and existing flags.\n\n4. Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n5. Continue this process until all bombs are flagged or all safe cells are revealed.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this Minesweeper problem, we need to methodically reveal safe cells and flag bombs based on the numbers revealed, which indicate how many bombs are adjacent to each cell. Here is a step-by-step approach to playing the game:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - The first move is safe, so choose a central cell to maximize the area revealed.\n   - Based on the number revealed, flag the appropriate number of adjacent cells as bombs.\n\n2. **Expand the Board**:\n   - Choose another safe cell away from the initial move to further expand the revealed area.\n   - Continue flagging cells based on the numbers revealed.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If a number indicates fewer bombs than the flags placed, remove flags accordingly.\n   - Ensure that the number of flags around each numbered cell matches the number shown.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, automatically reveal all adjacent cells as they are safe.\n\n5. **Progression**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust flags if there are conflicts between the numbers and the flags.\n\n6. **Completion**:\n   - The game is won by either revealing all safe cells or correctly flagging all bombs.\n\n### Solution Code Structure\n\nSince Minesweeper is an interactive problem, the solution involves a series of moves based on the board's state, which is updated after each move. Therefore, the solution is presented as a sequence of moves with explanations.\n\n### Example Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\n# Move 1: Initial safe move at center\nEXPLANATION: First move is safe; choosing center to maximize reveal area.\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '3'\n# Flag three adjacent cells\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '3' at (4,4), need to flag 3 adjacent cells.\nMOVE: 3,4,true\nMOVE: 4,3,true\nMOVE: 4,5,true\n\n# Move 2: Another safe move away from initial reveal\nEXPLANATION: Choosing another central but non-adjacent cell to expand the board.\nMOVE: 6,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '1'\n# Flag one adjacent cell\nEXPLANATION: Revealed '1' at (6,6), flagging one adjacent cell.\nMOVE: 6,5,true\n\n# Move 3: Reveal another cell to get more information\nEXPLANATION: Revealing another cell to expand the known board.\nMOVE: 5,4,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '2'\n# Adjust flags based on the '2'\nEXPLANATION: Adjust flags around (5,4) based on the '2'.\n# If conflict arises, unflag one of the adjacent cells.\nMOVE: 4,5,false  # Unflag if necessary\n\n# Move 4: Reveal a safe cell based on the numbers\nEXPLANATION: Revealing a safe cell adjacent to numbered cells.\nMOVE: 4,6,false\n\n# Assume reveals a '0'\n# Auto-reveal neighboring cells\nEXPLANATION: '0' means no adjacent bombs; auto-revealing neighbors.\n# The game should automatically reveal adjacent cells.\n\n# Continue this process until the game is won or lost.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Moves**:\n   - Start with a safe move at the center to maximize reveal.\n   - Flag adjacent cells based on the number revealed.\n\n2. **Expanding the Board**:\n   - Make another safe move away from the initial reveal to get more information.\n   - Flag cells accordingly based on new revelations.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - If flags exceed the number indicated, remove flags from safe cells.\n   - Ensure consistency between flags and revealed numbers.\n\n4. **Auto-Reveal Zeros**:\n   - When a '0' is revealed, the game automatically reveals adjacent cells, helping to expand the known board area quickly.\n\n5. **Progressive Revelation**:\n   - Continue revealing safe cells and flagging bombs based on the numbers and existing flags.\n   - Adjust strategies as new information is uncovered to avoid conflicts and progress towards winning the game.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 9, "y": 7, "is_flag": true}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10 with 10 bombs left, and I have 10 flags remaining. That means there are still 10 bombs hidden on the board.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the numbers and see where the bombs might be. Let's start from the top-left corner and work our way across.\n\nLooking at row 0, it's all unexplored, so nothing to go on there yet.\n\nRow 1: positions (1,0) to (1,4) are 1,1,1,_,_ and the rest are unexplored. So, positions (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2) all show '1'. That means each of these has exactly one bomb adjacent to them.\n\nSimilarly, in row 2: positions (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2) are all '.', which means unexplored, then (2,3) is '_', which is empty, then (2,4) is '1', (2,5) is '1', (2,6) is '1', and the rest are unexplored.\n\nWait, actually, row 2 shows: '.', '.', '1', '_', '1', '1', '1', '_', '_', '_'\n\nSo, positions (2,2) is '1', which means one adjacent bomb, and positions (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) are all '1's.\n\nRow 3: '.', '.', '2', '_', '1', '.', '1', '_', '_', '_'\n\nHere, position (3,2) is '2', which means two adjacent bombs, (3,4) is '1', (3,6) is '1', and (3,5) is '.', which is unexplored.\n\nRow 4: '.', '.', '1', '_', '1', '1', '1', '_', '_', '_'\n\nSimilar to row 2.\n\nRow 5: '.', '.', '3', '1', '_', '_', '_', '_', '_', '_'\n\nHere, position (5,2) is '3', which means three adjacent bombs, and (5,3) is '1'.\n\nRow 6: '.', '.', '.', '3', '1', '1', '_', '_', '_', '_'\n\nPosition (6,3) is '3', and (6,4) and (6,5) are '1's.\n\nRow 7: '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '1', '_', '_', '_', '_'\n\nPosition (7,5) is '1'.\n\nRow 8: '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '2', '1', '_', '_', '_'\n\nPosition (8,5) is '2', and (8,6) is '1'.\n\nRow 9: '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '1', '_', '_', '_'\n\nPosition (9,6) is '1'.\n\nAlright, so I need to look for areas where I can deduce the exact locations of the bombs based on the numbers.\n\nLet's look at row 5, position (5,2) which is '3'. It has three adjacent bombs. Let's see its neighbors:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nBut since (5,3) is '1', which already suggests one bomb adjacent to it, and (6,3) is '3', which needs three bombs adjacent to it.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the cluster around row 5 and 6.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board better.\n\nRows 5 and 6:\n\nRow 5: . . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 6: . . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _\n\nSo, position (5,2) is '3', and position (6,3) is '3'. Let's see their adjacent cells.\n\nFor (5,2):\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nFor (6,3):\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\nNow, (5,2) needs three bombs in its neighbors, and (6,3) needs three bombs in its neighbors.\n\nBut they share some neighbors: (5,3), (6,2), and (5,2) is already counted for (6,3).\n\nWait, no, (5,2) is already a number, so it's not a bomb.\n\nSo, for (5,2)=3, it needs three bombs in: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nFor (6,3)=3, it needs three bombs in: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\nBut (5,2) is already a number, so not a bomb.\n\nSo, for (5,2)=3, the potential bomb cells are: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nFor (6,3)=3, the potential bomb cells are: (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\nNow, let's see if there are any overlaps or if we can deduce anything.\n\nWait, position (5,3) is '1', which means only one adjacent bomb.\n\nLet's list the neighbors of (5,3):\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nBut (5,2) is '3', which is not a bomb, so only one of the remaining neighbors is a bomb.\n\nBut (6,3) is '3', which is not a bomb.\n\nSo, for (5,3)=1, the potential bomb neighbors are: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4)\n\nBut (4,2) is '.', (4,3) is '.', (4,4) is '_', (5,4) is '_', (6,2) is '.', (6,4) is '_'\n\nSo, only one of these is a bomb.\n\nBut (6,3)=3 needs three bombs in its neighbors: (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\nWait, but (5,3) is '1', which we just saw has only one adjacent bomb.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at another part of the board.\n\nLet's look at row 1 and row 2, which have some '1's and empty spaces.\n\nRow 1: 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 2: . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 3: . . 2 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 4: . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 5: . . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 6: . . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _\n\nRow 7: . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n\nRow 8: . . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n\nLooking at columns 0 and 1, they are mostly unexplored, so maybe not helpful right now.\n\nLet's look at column 2:\n\nRow 0: _\n\nRow 1: 1\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 6: .\n\nRow 7: .\n\nRow 8: .\n\nRow 9: .\n\nHmm, mostly unexplored except for row 1 with '1'.\n\nSo, position (1,2) is '1', which means one adjacent bomb.\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\nBut (1,1) is '1', which is not a bomb, and (1,3) is '_', which is empty, so no bomb there.\n\n(2,2) is '.', unexplored, (2,3) is '_', empty, so no bomb there.\n\n(0,2) is '_', empty, so no bomb there.\n\nSo, potential bomb neighbors are: (0,1), (0,3), (2,1)\n\nBut position (1,1) is '1', which also has one adjacent bomb.\n\nPosition (1,1) neighbors:\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nWe already know from (1,2) that (0,1), (0,3), (2,1) could be bombs.\n\nWait, but (1,1)=1, and its potential bomb neighbors are: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nBut (0,2) is '_', no bomb, (1,2) is '1', not a bomb, (2,2) is '.', possible bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0) is '.', possible bomb, (2,0) is '.', possible bomb.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a place where I can safely reveal a tile or place a flag with certainty.\n\nLet's look at row 7:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n\nPosition (7,5) is '1', which means one adjacent bomb.\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nBut (6,5) is '1', not a bomb, (6,6) is '_', empty, no bomb, (7,6) is '_', empty, no bomb, (8,5) is '2', not a bomb, (8,6) is '1', not a bomb.\n\nSo, potential bomb neighbors are: (6,4), (7,4), (8,4)\n\nBut position (6,4) is '_', unexplored, (7,4) is '_', unexplored, (8,4) is '_', unexplored.\n\nSo, only one of these three is a bomb.\n\nBut I have no further information to determine which one is the bomb.\n\nSimilarly, position (8,5)=2, which needs two adjacent bombs.\n\nNeighbors of (8,5):\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nBut (7,5) is '.', unexplored, (7,6) is '_', no bomb, (8,4) is '_', unexplored, (8,6) is '1', not a bomb, (9,4) is '_', unexplored, (9,5) is '_', unexplored, (9,6) is '1', not a bomb.\n\nSo, for (8,5)=2, the potential bomb neighbors are: (7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,5), (7,5)\n\nBut we already know from (7,5)=1 that it has one adjacent bomb, which could be connected to this.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's consider row 9.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . 1 _ _ _\n\nPosition (9,6)=1, which means one adjacent bomb.\n\nIts neighbors are:\n\n- (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7), (10,5), (10,6), (10,7)\n\nBut since the board is 10x10, row 10 doesn't exist, so only neighbors are: (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7)\n\nNow, (8,5)=2, not a bomb, (8,6)=1, not a bomb, (8,7)= '_', no bomb, (9,5)= '_', no bomb, (9,7)= '_', unexplored.\n\nSo, the only potential bomb neighbor is (9,7).\n\nBut position (9,6)=1 requires exactly one bomb adjacent to it, which would be (9,7).\n\nTherefore, (9,7) must be a bomb.\n\nSo, I can place a flag at (9,7).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that this doesn't conflict with any other numbers.\n\nLet's check the neighbors of (9,7):\n\n- (8,6)=1, not a bomb\n\n- (8,7)= '_', no bomb\n\n- (8,8)= '_', unexplored\n\n- (9,6)=1, not a bomb\n\n- (9,8)= '_', unexplored\n\n- (10,6)= invalid\n\n- (10,7)= invalid\n\n- (10,8)= invalid\n\nSo, placing a bomb at (9,7) would satisfy (9,6)=1.\n\nAlso, (8,6)=1 would have one adjacent bomb at (9,7), which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, (8,5)=2 needs two bombs adjacent to it.\n\nWait, position (8,5)=2, neighbors:\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nBut (8,6)=1, not a bomb, (9,6)=1, not a bomb, (7,6)= '_', no bomb, (8,4)= '_', unexplored, (9,4)= '_', unexplored, (9,5)= '_', unexplored, (7,5)= '.', unexplored.\n\nSo, for (8,5)=2, with (9,7) being a bomb, does that help?\n\nWait, (9,7) is not a neighbor of (8,5), so placing a bomb at (9,7) doesn't directly affect (8,5).\n\nBut (8,5)=2 needs two bombs in its neighbors: (7,4), (7,5), (8,4), (9,4), (9,5), (7,6), (8,6)=1, (9,6)=1.\n\nBut (8,6)=1 and (9,6)=1 are not bombs.\n\nSo, the potential bomb neighbors for (8,5)=2 are: (7,4), (7,5), (8,4), (9,4), (9,5)\n\nBut we already have (9,7) as a bomb, which is not adjacent to (8,5).\n\nSo, I need to place two bombs among (7,4), (7,5), (8,4), (9,4), (9,5)\n\nBut I don't have enough information to determine which ones are bombs.\n\nPerhaps placing a flag at (9,7) is safe for now.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nPosition (9,7) is only adjacent to (8,7), (8,8), (9,6), (9,8)\n\n(8,7)= '_', no bomb, (8,8)= '_', unexplored, (9,6)=1, not a bomb, (9,8)= '_', unexplored\n\nSo, placing a bomb at (9,7) satisfies (9,6)=1.\n\nNo conflicts with other numbers.\n\nTherefore, I can place a flag at (9,7).\n\n**Final Solution**\nTo proceed safely in this Minesweeper game, we need to carefully analyze the board state and make logical deductions to avoid revealing a bomb. Given the current board configuration, the best next move is to place a flag at position (9,7).\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Identify Key Positions:**\n   - Look for positions with numbers that indicate the exact count of adjacent bombs.\n   - Focus on areas where the number of unexplored squares matches the number of remaining bombs needed.\n\n2. **Analyze Row 9:**\n   - Position (9,6) shows '1', indicating exactly one adjacent bomb.\n   - Neighbors of (9,6): (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7)\n   - Known safe neighbors: (8,6)='1', (8,7)='_', (9,5)='_'\n   - Unexplored neighbors: (8,5)='2', (9,7)='_' \n\n3. **Determine Bomb Location:**\n   - Since (9,6)='1' requires exactly one adjacent bomb, and considering the neighbors:\n     - (8,5) is '2', which is a number, not a bomb.\n     - Therefore, the only unexplored neighbor is (9,7), which must be a bomb.\n\n4. **Verify Consistency:**\n   - Placing a bomb at (9,7) does not conflict with other number indications.\n   - Position (8,5)='2' has its own set of potential bomb neighbors, but (9,7) is not adjacent to it, so no conflict.\n\n5. **Make the Move:**\n   - Place a flag at (9,7) to mark it as a bomb.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are making a logical and safe decision based on the current board state, minimizing the risk of revealing a bomb.\n\n**MOVE: 9,7,true**", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n3 . . 2 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n4 . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n5 . . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n8 . . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n9 . . . . . . 1 _ _ _", "sucess": true}
{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 8, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see that there's a flagged space at (9,7), which is the only flag on the board right now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. The board has numbers indicating how many bombs are adjacent to each revealed cell. Unrevealed cells are marked with '.', and revealed empty spaces are marked with '_'. Bombs are represented by 'F' if flagged or '*' if revealed and detonated.\n\nLet's start by examining the areas where I have some numbers and see if I can deduce the positions of the bombs.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 2:\n\n. . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 3:\n\n. . 2 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 4:\n\n. . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 5:\n\n. . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 6:\n\n. . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _\n\nRow 7:\n\n. . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n\nRow 8:\n\n. . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 9:\n\n. . . . . . 1 F _ _\n\nOkay, let's focus on the area around the flagged cell at (9,7). There's a '1' at (7,5), and the flagged cell is at (9,7). Let's see what's going on there.\n\nAt (7,5), there's a '1', which means one of the eight surrounding cells has a bomb. The surrounding cells are:\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n- (7,4), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nNow, looking at (8,6), there's a '1', which means one of its eight surrounding cells has a bomb. Its surrounding cells are:\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n- (8,5), (8,7)\n\n- (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\nWait, (9,7) is already flagged, so that's one bomb accounted for in both (7,5)'s and (8,6)'s adjacent cells.\n\nSo, for (7,5)'s '1', since (9,7) is already flagged, that means there are no other bombs in its adjacent cells. So, all other adjacent cells to (7,5) should be safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,6)'s '1', since (9,7) is flagged, there should be no other bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nWait, but (8,6) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (9,7) which is a bomb, so indeed, no other adjacent cells to (8,6) should have bombs.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal the other adjacent cells to (7,5) and (8,6), except for (9,7), which is already flagged.\n\nLet's list the adjacent cells for (7,5):\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n- (7,4), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nBut (8,6) is already a number, so we don't need to do anything with it. Similarly, (9,7) is flagged, which is not adjacent to (7,5). Wait, (9,7) is not adjacent to (7,5); the furthest it is is two rows down and two columns to the right.\n\nWait a minute, let's check the adjacency again.\n\nWait, (7,5) has adjacent cells:\n\n- Up-left: (6,4)\n\n- Up: (6,5)\n\n- Up-right: (6,6)\n\n- Left: (7,4)\n\n- Right: (7,6)\n\n- Down-left: (8,4)\n\n- Down: (8,5)\n\n- Down-right: (8,6)\n\nNone of these are (9,7), which is further down at (9,7). So, (9,7) is not adjacent to (7,5). Hmm, that means the flag at (9,7) doesn't directly affect the '1' at (7,5).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet me look at row 5:\n\n. . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nAt (5,2), there's a '3', which means three of its adjacent cells have bombs.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, looking at these cells:\n\n- (4,1): '.'\n\n- (4,2): '.'\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\n- (6,1): '.'\n\n- (6,2): '3'\n\n- (6,3): '1'\n\nSo, among these, (5,3) is a '1', which means one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is a '1', which also indicates one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nAnd (6,2) is a '3', indicating three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler deduction.\n\nLet's look at row 8:\n\n. . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n\nAt (8,5), there's a '2', which means two of its adjacent cells have bombs.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,6)\n\n- (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nNow, looking at these cells:\n\n- (7,4): '.'\n\n- (7,5): '1'\n\n- (7,6): '_'\n\n- (8,4): '.'\n\n- (8,6): '1'\n\n- (9,4): '.'\n\n- (9,5): '.'\n\n- (9,6): '.'\n\nSo, among these, (7,5) is a '1', which we've already considered, and (8,6) is a '1'.\n\nWait, (8,6) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (9,7), which is flagged.\n\nWait, (9,7) is flagged, which is adjacent to (8,6).\n\nWait, (8,6) is adjacent to (9,7), which is flagged, so that counts as one bomb for (8,6)'s '1'. Therefore, there should be no other bombs in (8,6)'s adjacent cells.\n\nSo, for (8,6), the adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n- (8,5), (8,7)\n\n- (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\nOut of these, (9,7) is flagged, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nSo, (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6) should all be safe to reveal.\n\nLet's check if any of these are already revealed.\n\n(7,5) is a '1', (7,6) is '_', (7,7) is '_', (8,5) is '.', (8,7) is '.', (9,5) is '.', (9,6) is '.'.\n\nSo, (7,6) and (7,7) are already revealed as empty, and the others are unexplored.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), and (9,6).\n\nBut before doing that, let's see if there's a better move or if there's a risk involved.\n\nWait, but according to the rule, since (8,6) is a '1' and (9,7) is already flagged, the other adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nSo, I can reveal (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), and (9,6).\n\nLet me choose one of these to reveal. Maybe (8,5).\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's a better move elsewhere.\n\nLooking back at row 5:\n\n. . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nAt (5,2), there's a '3', which has three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, (5,3) is a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is a '1', which also has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nAnd (6,2) is a '3', which has three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nThis seems like a cluster with multiple numbers, which could be tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider placing flags in some of these cells.\n\nLet's see, for (5,2)'s '3', which has eight adjacent cells, and three of them have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2)'s '3' has three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nLet's list the adjacent cells for both:\n\n(5,2)'s adjacent cells:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\n(6,2)'s adjacent cells:\n\n- (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nSo, overlapping cells are:\n\n- (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, (5,2) is '3', so three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\n(6,2) is '3', so three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nBut their adjacent cells overlap, so we need to consider the shared cells.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe unique cells for (5,2)'s '3' are:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (6,1), (6,3)\n\nPlus the shared cells: (5,1), (5,3), (6,2)\n\nBut (6,2) is the cell itself, so not counted.\n\nWait, in Minesweeper, a numbered cell counts the bombs in its adjacent cells, not including itself.\n\nSo, for (5,2)'s '3', the adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2)'s '3', the adjacent cells are:\n\n- (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nSo, the overlapping cells are:\n\n- (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nBut (5,2) and (6,2) are the numbered cells themselves, so they don't contain bombs.\n\nSo, for (5,2)'s '3', the three bombs are in:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2)'s '3', the three bombs are in:\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nSo, the common cells between the two are:\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\nNow, since both '3's point to these cells, and each '3' needs three bombs in their adjacent cells, but some of those cells are shared, it's a bit tricky.\n\nLet's see how many bombs are required in total.\n\nLet me try to set up equations.\n\nLet's denote:\n\nA: (4,1)\n\nB: (4,2)\n\nC: (4,3)\n\nD: (5,1)\n\nE: (5,3)\n\nF: (6,1)\n\nG: (6,3)\n\nH: (7,1)\n\nI: (7,2)\n\nJ: (7,3)\n\nNow, (5,2)'s '3' requires A + B + C + D + E + F + G = 3\n\nAnd (6,2)'s '3' requires D + E + F + G + H + I + J = 3\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because each '3' should have exactly three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nWait, but actually, in Minesweeper, the number indicates exactly how many bombs are in the adjacent cells.\n\nSo, for (5,2)'s '3', A + B + C + D + E + F + G = 3\n\nAnd for (6,2)'s '3', D + E + F + G + H + I + J = 3\n\nBut we don't know the values of these variables; they are either 0 or 1, representing no bomb or bomb.\n\nThis seems like a system of equations, but it's a bit complex to solve without more information.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the '1's in this area.\n\nAt (5,3), there's a '1', which means one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n- (5,2), (5,4)\n\n- (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nNow, among these, (5,2) is a '3', which is not a bomb, and (6,2) is a '3', also not a bomb.\n\nSo, the possible bomb locations are:\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (6,3), (6,4)\n\nBut (6,3) is a '1', which means one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)\n\n- (6,2), (6,4)\n\n- (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\nAgain, (5,2) and (6,2) are numbers, not bombs.\n\nSo, for (6,3)'s '1', the bomb is in one of:\n\n- (5,3), (5,4)\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\nBut (5,3) is adjacent to (5,2)'s '3' and (6,2)'s '3'.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different area of the board.\n\nLet's look back at the bottom right corner where there's a flagged cell at (9,7).\n\nWe've already determined that the adjacent cells to (8,6) can be safely revealed because (8,6) is a '1' and (9,7) is flagged.\n\nSo, I can reveal (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), and (9,6).\n\nLet me choose to reveal (8,5).\n\nBut before doing that, let's see if revealing any of these cells might give me more information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a flag in one of the unexplored cells based on the numbers I have.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n. . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nAt (2,2), there's a '1', which means one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\n- (2,1), (2,3)\n\n- (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nNow, (1,1) is '1', (1,2) is '1', (1,3) is '1', all revealed numbers.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is '.', (2,3) is '1', (3,1) is '.', (3,2) is '2', (3,3) is '1'.\n\nSo, for (2,2)'s '1', the only possible bomb is in (3,2), which is a '2'.\n\nWait, but (3,2) is a '2', which means it's a number, not a bomb.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, (2,2) is a '1', and its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (1,1): '1'\n\n- (1,2): '1'\n\n- (1,3): '1'\n\n- (2,1): '.'\n\n- (2,3): '1'\n\n- (3,1): '.'\n\n- (3,2): '2'\n\n- (3,3): '1'\n\nAmong these, the only unexplored cells are (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2) is a '2'.\n\nBut (3,2) is a '2', which is a number, not a bomb.\n\nSo, the bomb must be in (2,1) or (3,1).\n\nBut (2,2)'s '1' indicates only one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nSo, either (2,1) or (3,1) has a bomb, but not both.\n\nWait, but (3,1) is adjacent to (3,2)'s '2'.\n\nWait, (3,2) is a '2', which needs two bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\n- (3,1), (3,3)\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nNow, (2,2) is a '1', which we've already considered.\n\nSo, for (3,2)'s '2', it needs two bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nCurrently, possible bomb locations are (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nBut (2,2)'s '1' indicates that only one of (2,1) and (3,1) has a bomb.\n\nSo, if (2,1) has a bomb, then (3,1) doesn't, and vice versa.\n\nBut (3,2)'s '2' needs two bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nSo, if (2,1) has a bomb, then another bomb needs to be in one of (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nBut (3,1) can't have a bomb if (2,1) does, because (2,2)'s '1' only allows one bomb.\n\nTherefore, if (2,1) has a bomb, then the other bomb for (3,2)'s '2' must be in (4,1), (4,2), or (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, if (3,1) has a bomb, then (2,1) doesn't, and the other bomb for (3,2)'s '2' must be in (4,1), (4,2), or (4,3).\n\nThis is getting too complicated.

Bombs are represented by 'F' if flagged or '*' if revealed and detonated.\n\nLet's start by examining the areas where I have some numbers and see if I can deduce the positions of the bombs.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 2:\n\n. . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 3:\n\n. . 2 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 4:\n\n. . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 5:\n\n. . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 6:\n\n. . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _\n\nRow 7:\n\n. . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n\nRow 8:\n\n. . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 9:\n\n. . . . . . 1 F _ _\n\nOkay, let's focus on the area around the flagged cell at (9,7). There's a '1' at (7,5), and the flagged cell is at (9,7). Let's see what's going on there.\n\nAt (7,5), there's a '1', which means one of the eight surrounding cells has a bomb. The surrounding cells are:\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n- (7,4), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nNow, looking at (8,6), there's a '1', which means one of its eight surrounding cells has a bomb. Its surrounding cells are:\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n- (8,5), (8,7)\n\n- (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\nWait, (9,7) is already flagged, so that's one bomb accounted for in both (7,5)'s and (8,6)'s adjacent cells.\n\nSo, for (7,5)'s '1', since (9,7) is already flagged, that means there are no other bombs in its adjacent cells. So, all other adjacent cells to (7,5) should be safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,6)'s '1', since (9,7) is flagged, there should be no other bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nWait, but (8,6) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (9,7) which is a bomb, so indeed, no other adjacent cells to (8,6) should have bombs.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal the other adjacent cells to (7,5) and (8,6), except for (9,7), which is already flagged.\n\nLet's list the adjacent cells for (7,5):\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n- (7,4), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nBut (8,6) is already a number, so we don't need to do anything with it. Similarly, (9,7) is flagged, which is not adjacent to (7,5). Wait, (9,7) is not adjacent to (7,5); the furthest it is is two rows down and two columns to the right.\n\nWait a minute, let's check the adjacency again.\n\nWait, (7,5) has adjacent cells:\n\n- Up-left: (6,4)\n\n- Up: (6,5)\n\n- Up-right: (6,6)\n\n- Left: (7,4)\n\n- Right: (7,6)\n\n- Down-left: (8,4)\n\n- Down: (8,5)\n\n- Down-right: (8,6)\n\nNone of these are (9,7), which is further down at (9,7). So, (9,7) is not adjacent to (7,5). Hmm, that means the flag at (9,7) doesn't directly affect the '1' at (7,5).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet me look at row 5:\n\n. . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nAt (5,2), there's a '3', which means three of its adjacent cells have bombs.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, looking at these cells:\n\n- (4,1): '.'\n\n- (4,2): '.'\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\n- (6,1): '.'\n\n- (6,2): '3'\n\n- (6,3): '1'\n\nSo, among these, (5,3) is a '1', which means one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is a '1', which also indicates one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nAnd (6,2) is a '3', indicating three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler deduction.\n\nLet's look at row 8:\n\n. . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n\nAt (8,5), there's a '2', which means two of its adjacent cells have bombs.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,6)\n\n- (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nNow, looking at these cells:\n\n- (7,4): '.'\n\n- (7,5): '1'\n\n- (7,6): '_'\n\n- (8,4): '.'\n\n- (8,6): '1'\n\n- (9,4): '.'\n\n- (9,5): '.'\n\n- (9,6): '.'\n\nSo, among these, (7,5) is a '1', which we've already considered, and (8,6) is a '1'.\n\nWait, (8,6) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (9,7), which is flagged.\n\nWait, (9,7) is flagged, which is adjacent to (8,6).\n\nWait, (8,6) is adjacent to (9,7), which is flagged, so that counts as one bomb for (8,6)'s '1'. Therefore, there should be no other bombs in (8,6)'s adjacent cells.\n\nSo, for (8,6), the adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n- (8,5), (8,7)\n\n- (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\nOut of these, (9,7) is flagged, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nSo, (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6) should all be safe to reveal.\n\nLet's check if any of these are already revealed.\n\n(7,5) is a '1', (7,6) is '_', (7,7) is '_', (8,5) is '.', (8,7) is '.', (9,5) is '.', (9,6) is '.'.\n\nSo, (7,6) and (7,7) are already revealed as empty, and the others are unexplored.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), and (9,6).\n\nBut before doing that, let's see if there's a better move or if there's a risk involved.\n\nWait, but according to the rule, since (8,6) is a '1' and (9,7) is already flagged, the other adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nSo, I can reveal (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), and (9,6).\n\nLet me choose one of these to reveal. Maybe I'll choose (8,5).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the '1' at (8,6) and the flagged bomb at (9,7), the adjacent cells to (8,6) except (9,7) should be safe.

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 8, "y": 5, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see that there's a flagged space at (9,7), which is the only flag on the board right now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. The board has numbers indicating how many bombs are adjacent to each revealed cell. Unrevealed cells are marked with '.', and revealed empty spaces are marked with '_'. Bombs are represented by 'F' if flagged or '*' if revealed and detonated.\n\nLet's start by examining the areas where I have some numbers and see if I can deduce the positions of the bombs.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 2:\n\n. . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 3:\n\n. . 2 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 4:\n\n. . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 5:\n\n. . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 6:\n\n. . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _\n\nRow 7:\n\n. . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n\nRow 8:\n\n. . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 9:\n\n. . . . . . 1 F _ _\n\nOkay, let's focus on the area around the flagged cell at (9,7). There's a '1' at (7,5), and the flagged cell is at (9,7). Let's see what's going on there.\n\nAt (7,5), there's a '1', which means one of the eight surrounding cells has a bomb. The surrounding cells are:\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n- (7,4), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nNow, looking at (8,6), there's a '1', which means one of its eight surrounding cells has a bomb. Its surrounding cells are:\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n- (8,5), (8,7)\n\n- (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\nWait, (9,7) is already flagged, so that's one bomb accounted for in both (7,5)'s and (8,6)'s adjacent cells.\n\nSo, for (7,5)'s '1', since (9,7) is already flagged, that means there are no other bombs in its adjacent cells. So, all other adjacent cells to (7,5) should be safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,6)'s '1', since (9,7) is flagged, there should be no other bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nWait, but (8,6) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (9,7) which is a bomb, so indeed, no other adjacent cells to (8,6) should have bombs.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal the other adjacent cells to (7,5) and (8,6), except for (9,7), which is already flagged.\n\nLet's list the adjacent cells for (7,5):\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n- (7,4), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nBut (8,6) is already a number, so we don't need to do anything with it. Similarly, (9,7) is flagged, which is not adjacent to (7,5). Wait, (9,7) is not adjacent to (7,5); the furthest it is is two rows down and two columns to the right.\n\nWait a minute, let's check the adjacency again.\n\nWait, (7,5) has adjacent cells:\n\n- Up-left: (6,4)\n\n- Up: (6,5)\n\n- Up-right: (6,6)\n\n- Left: (7,4)\n\n- Right: (7,6)\n\n- Down-left: (8,4)\n\n- Down: (8,5)\n\n- Down-right: (8,6)\n\nNone of these are (9,7), which is further down at (9,7). So, (9,7) is not adjacent to (7,5). Hmm, that means the flag at (9,7) doesn't directly affect the '1' at (7,5).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet me look at row 5:\n\n. . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nAt (5,2), there's a '3', which means three of its adjacent cells have bombs.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, looking at these cells:\n\n- (4,1): '.'\n\n- (4,2): '.'\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\n- (6,1): '.'\n\n- (6,2): '3'\n\n- (6,3): '1'\n\nSo, among these, (5,3) is a '1', which means one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is a '1', which also indicates one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nAnd (6,2) is a '3', indicating three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler deduction.\n\nLet's look at row 8:\n\n. . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n\nAt (8,5), there's a '2', which means two of its adjacent cells have bombs.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,6)\n\n- (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nNow, looking at these cells:\n\n- (7,4): '.'\n\n- (7,5): '1'\n\n- (7,6): '_'\n\n- (8,4): '.'\n\n- (8,6): '1'\n\n- (9,4): '.'\n\n- (9,5): '.'\n\n- (9,6): '.'\n\nSo, among these, (7,5) is a '1', which we've already considered, and (8,6) is a '1'.\n\nWait, (8,6) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (9,7), which is flagged.\n\nWait, (9,7) is flagged, which is adjacent to (8,6).\n\nWait, (8,6) is adjacent to (9,7), which is flagged, so that counts as one bomb for (8,6)'s '1'. Therefore, there should be no other bombs in (8,6)'s adjacent cells.\n\nSo, for (8,6), the adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n- (8,5), (8,7)\n\n- (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\nOut of these, (9,7) is flagged, so that's one bomb. Therefore, the other adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nSo, (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6) should all be safe to reveal.\n\nLet's check if any of these are already revealed.\n\n(7,5) is a '1', (7,6) is '_', (7,7) is '_', (8,5) is '.', (8,7) is '.', (9,5) is '.', (9,6) is '.'.\n\nSo, (7,6) and (7,7) are already revealed as empty, and the others are unexplored.\n\nTherefore, I can safely reveal (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), and (9,6).\n\nBut before doing that, let's see if there's a better move or if there's a risk involved.\n\nWait, but according to the rule, since (8,6) is a '1' and (9,7) is already flagged, the other adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nSo, I can reveal (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), and (9,6).\n\nLet me choose one of these to reveal. Maybe (8,5).\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's a better move elsewhere.\n\nLooking back at row 5:\n\n. . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nAt (5,2), there's a '3', which has three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, (5,3) is a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is a '1', which also has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nAnd (6,2) is a '3', which has three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nThis seems like a cluster with multiple numbers, which could be tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider placing flags in some of these cells.\n\nLet's see, for (5,2)'s '3', which has eight adjacent cells, and three of them have bombs.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2)'s '3' has three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nLet's list the adjacent cells for both:\n\n(5,2)'s adjacent cells:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\n(6,2)'s adjacent cells:\n\n- (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nSo, overlapping cells are:\n\n- (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, (5,2) is '3', so three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\n(6,2) is '3', so three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nBut their adjacent cells overlap, so we need to consider the shared cells.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe unique cells for (5,2)'s '3' are:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (6,1), (6,3)\n\nPlus the shared cells: (5,1), (5,3), (6,2)\n\nBut (6,2) is the cell itself, so not counted.\n\nWait, in Minesweeper, a numbered cell counts the bombs in its adjacent cells, not including itself.\n\nSo, for (5,2)'s '3', the adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2)'s '3', the adjacent cells are:\n\n- (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nSo, the overlapping cells are:\n\n- (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nBut (5,2) and (6,2) are the numbered cells themselves, so they don't contain bombs.\n\nSo, for (5,2)'s '3', the three bombs are in:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2)'s '3', the three bombs are in:\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nSo, the common cells between the two are:\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\nNow, since both '3's point to these cells, and each '3' needs three bombs in their adjacent cells, but some of those cells are shared, it's a bit tricky.\n\nLet's see how many bombs are required in total.\n\nLet me try to set up equations.\n\nLet's denote:\n\nA: (4,1)\n\nB: (4,2)\n\nC: (4,3)\n\nD: (5,1)\n\nE: (5,3)\n\nF: (6,1)\n\nG: (6,3)\n\nH: (7,1)\n\nI: (7,2)\n\nJ: (7,3)\n\nNow, (5,2)'s '3' requires A + B + C + D + E + F + G = 3\n\nAnd (6,2)'s '3' requires D + E + F + G + H + I + J = 3\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because each '3' should have exactly three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nWait, but actually, in Minesweeper, the number indicates exactly how many bombs are in the adjacent cells.\n\nSo, for (5,2)'s '3', A + B + C + D + E + F + G = 3\n\nAnd for (6,2)'s '3', D + E + F + G + H + I + J = 3\n\nBut we don't know the values of these variables; they are either 0 or 1, representing no bomb or bomb.\n\nThis seems like a system of equations, but it's a bit complex to solve without more information.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the '1's in this area.\n\nAt (5,3), there's a '1', which means one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n- (5,2), (5,4)\n\n- (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nNow, among these, (5,2) is a '3', which is not a bomb, and (6,2) is a '3', also not a bomb.\n\nSo, the possible bomb locations are:\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (6,3), (6,4)\n\nBut (6,3) is a '1', which means one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)\n\n- (6,2), (6,4)\n\n- (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\nAgain, (5,2) and (6,2) are numbers, not bombs.\n\nSo, for (6,3)'s '1', the possible bomb locations are:\n\n- (5,3), (5,4)\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\nBut (5,3) is adjacent to (5,2)'s '3' and (6,2)'s '3'.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different area of the board.\n\nLet's look at the top part of the board.\n\nRow 0:\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 1:\n\n1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 2:\n\n. . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _

_\n\nSimilarly, '1's indicate one adjacent bomb each.\n\nLet's focus on row 1 and row 2.\n\nAt (1,0): '1', adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n\n- (1,1), (1,2)\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nSimilarly, (1,1): '1', adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n\n- (1,0), (1,2)\n\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nAnd (1,2): '1', adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)\n\n- (1,1), (1,3)\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\nNow, looking at these, there are overlapping adjacent cells.\n\nLet me see if I can find any bombs in this area.\n\nGiven that each '1' has exactly one adjacent bomb, and these '1's are adjacent to each other, perhaps I can find a pattern.\n\nBut this seems time-consuming, and I might not find an immediate solution here.\n\nMaybe I should consider revealing a cell that seems safe based on the current information.\n\nLooking back at (8,5), which is adjacent to (8,6)'s '1', and since (9,7) is already flagged, perhaps revealing (8,5) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should flag another cell based on the '3's in row 5.\n\nThis is getting too complicated, and I don't want to make a mistake.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nI know there are 10 bombs in total, and 9 flags remaining, meaning one flag has already been placed at (9,7).\n\nSo, only one bomb is not yet flagged.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because the total number of bombs is 10, and if one is already flagged, there should be 9 more to be flagged.\n\nBut the game says \"Flags remaining: 9\", which probably means you can place 9 more flags, implying that one flag has already been placed.\n\nSo, total flags that can be placed is 10, matching the number of bombs.\n\nSo, you have to place all 10 flags on the bombs.\n\nNow, if I can find a cell that is definitely a bomb, I should flag it.\n\nAlternatively, if I can confirm that a cell is safe, I can reveal it.\n\nLooking back at the '3's in row 5, perhaps I can deduce where the bombs are.\n\nLet me consider the adjacent cells to (5,2)'s '3' and (6,2)'s '3'.\n\nFrom earlier, the adjacent cells are:\n\nFor (5,2)'s '3':\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\nFor (6,2)'s '3':\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nSo, the overlapping cells are:\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\nNow, (5,2)'s '3' needs three bombs in its adjacent cells, and (6,2)'s '3' also needs three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nSo, in total, there are seven cells that are adjacent to either '3':\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nBut some of these are shared, so perhaps there are only certain configurations that satisfy both '3's.\n\nThis seems too complex for me to figure out right now.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different area.\n\nLooking at row 8:\n\n. . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n\nAt (8,5), there's a '2', which has two bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nAdjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,6)\n\n- (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nNow, (7,5) is a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\n(8,6) is a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\n(9,7) is flagged, but it's not adjacent to (8,5).\n\nWait, (9,7) is at (9,7), and (8,5) is at (8,5), so they are two rows down and two columns to the right, which is not adjacent.\n\nSo, for (8,5)'s '2', two bombs are in its adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells:\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,6)\n\n- (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nNow, (7,5) is a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\n(8,6) is a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nBut (9,7) is flagged, which is not adjacent to (8,5).\n\nWait, (9,7) is not adjacent to (8,5), so it doesn't directly affect (8,5)'s '2'.\n\nSo, for (8,5)'s '2', two bombs are in:\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,6)\n\n- (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nNow, (7,5) is a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6) is a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nBut (9,7) is flagged, which is adjacent to (8,6), so that bomb is already accounted for in (8,6)'s '1'.\n\nWait, (8,6) is adjacent to (9,7), which is flagged, so that's one bomb for (8,6)'s '1'.\n\nTherefore, no other bombs are adjacent to (8,6).\n\nSo, for (8,5)'s '2', the two bombs must be in:\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,6)\n\n- (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nBut since (8,6) is not a bomb, and its other adjacent cells are safe, that means the two bombs for (8,5)'s '2' must be in:\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4)\n\n- (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nBut (7,5) is a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing.\n\nMaybe I should consider that (8,5)'s '2' requires two bombs in its adjacent cells, and since (8,6) is not a bomb, and (9,7) is already flagged and not adjacent to (8,5), perhaps one of (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6) contains the two bombs.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to pinpoint their locations.\n\nMaybe I should reveal one of the unflagged cells around (8,5) and see what happens.\n\nFor example, reveal (9,5).\n\nBut I'm not sure if it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at another part of the board.\n\nLooking back at row 3:\n\n. . 2 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n\nAt (3,2), there's a '2', which has two bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nAdjacent cells are:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\n- (3,1), (3,3)\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nNow, looking at these cells:\n\n- (2,1): '.'\n\n- (2,2): '1'\n\n- (2,3): '_'\n\n- (3,1): '.'\n\n- (3,3): '.'\n\n- (4,1): '.'\n\n- (4,2): '.'\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\nSo, (2,2) is a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is a '1', which has one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nThis seems like another complex area.\n\nMaybe I should consider that (3,2)'s '2' has two bombs in its adjacent cells, and try to find a configuration that fits.\n\nBut again, it's too time-consuming.\n\nPerhaps I should just pick a cell that seems safe to reveal.\n\nLooking back at (8,5), which is adjacent to (8,6)'s '1', and since (9,7) is already flagged, perhaps revealing (8,5) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should flag a cell that seems likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at the '3's in row 5, perhaps one of the adjacent cells is a bomb.\n\nBut I don't want to make a mistake and flag a wrong cell.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the safest move is to reveal a cell that is probably safe.\n\nSo, I'll choose to reveal (8,5).\n\n**EXPLANATION:** Based on the analysis of the '1's and '2's in the lower part of the board, particularly around the flagged cell at (9,7), it seems that revealing (8,5) should be safe.\n\n**MOVE:** 8,5,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

{"type": "move", "move": {"x": 7, "y": 4, "is_flag": false}, "explanation": "Alright, I'm looking at this Minesweeper board. Let's see what I can figure out. So, the board is 10x10, and there are 10 bombs in total. Currently, there are 9 flags remaining, which means one flag has already been placed. Looking at the board, I see that there's a flagged space at (9,7), which is the only flag on the board right now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. The board has numbers indicating how many bombs are adjacent to each revealed cell. Unrevealed cells are marked with '.', and revealed empty spaces are marked with '_'. Bombs are represented by 'F' if flagged or '*' if revealed and detonated.\n\nLet's start by examining the areas where I have some numbers and see if I can deduce the positions of the bombs.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 2:\n\n. . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 3:\n\n. . 2 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 4:\n\n. . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 5:\n\n. . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRow 6:\n\n. . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _\n\nRow 7:\n\n. . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n\nRow 8:\n\n. . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n\nRow 9:\n\n. . . . . . 1 F _ _\n\nOkay, let's focus on the area around the flagged cell at (9,7). There's a '1' at (7,5), and the flagged cell is at (9,7). Let's see what's going on there.\n\nAt (7,5), there's a '1', which means one of the eight surrounding cells has a bomb. The surrounding cells are:\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n- (7,4), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nNow, looking at (8,6), there's a '1', which means one of its eight surrounding cells has a bomb. Its surrounding cells are:\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n- (8,5), (8,7)\n\n- (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\nWait, (9,7) is already flagged, so that's one bomb accounted for in both (7,5)'s and (8,6)'s adjacent cells.\n\nSo, for (7,5)'s '1', since (9,7) is already flagged, that means there are no other bombs in its adjacent cells. So, all other adjacent cells to (7,5) should be safe to reveal.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,6)'s '1', since (9,7) is flagged, there should be no other bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nWait, but (8,6) is a '1', and it's adjacent to (9,7) which is a bomb, so indeed, no other adjacent cells to (8,6) should have bombs.\n\nSo, I can safely reveal the other adjacent cells to (7,5) and (8,6), except for (9,7), which is already flagged.\n\nLet's list the adjacent cells for (7,5):\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n- (7,4), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nBut (8,6) is already a number, so we don't need to do anything with it. Similarly, (9,7) is flagged, which is not adjacent to (7,5). Wait, (9,7) is not adjacent to (7,5); the furthest it is is two rows down and two columns to the right.\n\nWait a minute, let's check the adjacency again.\n\nWait, (7,5) has adjacent cells:\n\n- Up-left: (6,4)\n\n- Up: (6,5)\n\n- Up-right: (6,6)\n\n- Left: (7,4)\n\n- Right: (7,6)\n\n- Down-left: (8,4)\n\n- Down: (8,5)\n\n- Down-right: (8,6)\n\nNone of these are (9,7), which is further down at (9,7). So, (9,7) is not adjacent to (7,5). Hmm, that means the flag at (9,7) doesn't directly affect the '1' at (7,5).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLet me look at row 5:\n\n. . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nAt (5,2), there's a '3', which means three of its adjacent cells have bombs.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, looking at these cells:\n\n- (4,1): '.'\n\n- (4,2): '.'\n\n- (4,3): '_'\n\n- (5,1): '.'\n\n- (5,3): '1'\n\n- (6,1): '.'\n\n- (6,2): '3'\n\n- (6,3): '1'\n\nSo, among these, (5,3) is a '1', which means one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is a '1', which also indicates one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nAnd (6,2) is a '3', indicating three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler deduction.\n\nLet's look at row 8:\n\n. . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n\nAt (8,5), there's a '2', which means two of its adjacent cells have bombs.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,6)\n\n- (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nNow, looking at these cells:\n\n- (7,4): '.'\n\n- (7,5): '1'\n\n- (7,6): '_'\n\n- (8,4): '.'\n\n- (8,6): '1'\n\n- (9,4): '.'\n\n- (9,5): '.'\n\n- (9,6): '.'\n\nSo, among these, (7,5) is a '1', which we've already considered, and (8,6) is a '1'.\n\nGiven that (9,7) is flagged, which is not adjacent to (8,5), does that provide any information here?\n\nWait, (9,7) is not adjacent to (8,5); it's two cells down and two to the right. So, it doesn't directly affect the '2' at (8,5).\n\nMaybe I need to look at the '3' at (5,2) more carefully.\n\nAt (5,2), '3', with adjacent cells:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, (5,3) is a '1', and (6,2) is a '3', and (6,3) is a '1'.\n\nLet's consider the '3' at (6,2).\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nNow, (5,2) is a '3', (5,3) is a '1', (6,3) is a '1'.\n\nThis seems interconnected; maybe I need to consider multiple cells together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a cell that can only be a bomb or safe based on the numbers.\n\nLet's consider the '1' at (7,5).\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n- (7,4), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nNone of these are flagged yet, except (9,7), which isn't adjacent.\n\nSo, for the '1' at (7,5), only one of these eight cells has a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6) is a '1', so only one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to pinpoint exactly where the bomb is.\n\nMaybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at row 2:\n\n. . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n\nAt (2,2), there's a '1', with adjacent cells:\n\n- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\n- (2,1), (2,3)\n\n- (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nNow, (1,1) is '1', (1,2) is '1', (1,3) is '1', (2,1) is '.', (2,3) is '1', (3,1) is '.', (3,2) is '2', (3,3) is '_'\n\nSo, for (2,2)'s '1', considering the adjacent cells, there should be one bomb among them.\n\nBut many of these are numbers already, which might help in deducing.\n\nWait, perhaps this area is too interconnected and not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a cell that's definitely safe to reveal.\n\nLet's consider the '1' at (7,5) again.\n\nSince only one of its adjacent cells has a bomb, and none are currently flagged, I can consider revealing one of them, but that's risky because I don't know which one has the bomb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a cell that's surrounded by numbers in a way that indicates it's safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, it's all unexplored, which might not help much right now.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find a cell where the number of unknowns matches the number of remaining bombs needed for that number.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has only one unflagged adjacent cell, then that cell must be a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, if a '2' has two unflagged adjacent cells and no flags, then both must be bombs.\n\nBut in this board, I don't see such straightforward scenarios.\n\nLet's look at (5,2)'s '3'.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNone of these are currently flagged, and all are unrevealed except (5,3) which is a '1'.\n\nWait, (5,3) is a '1', which means one of its adjacent cells has a bomb.\n\n(5,3)'s adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n- (5,2), (5,4)\n\n- (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nNow, (5,2) is a '3', which needs three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\n(5,3) is a '1', which needs one bomb in its adjacent cells.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possibility of placing a flag in a cell that must be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at (5,2)'s '3', which has eight adjacent cells, none of which are flagged yet.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2)'s '3' has eight adjacent cells, none flagged.\n\nPerhaps I need to look for a cell that is the only possible location for a bomb based on multiple numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the total number of flags remaining.\n\nThere are 9 flags remaining, and 10 bombs in total, meaning one bomb has already been flagged at (9,7).\n\nSo, there are 9 bombs left to be flagged.\n\nNow, I need to be careful not to place flags on cells that are actually safe.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a cell that, if it were a bomb, would satisfy multiple numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a cell that cannot be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, if a '1' already has a flagged adjacent cell, then the other adjacent cells cannot be bombs.\n\nWait, let's check if any '1's have already been flagged.\n\nLooking at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7)\n\nNone of these have adjacent flags except for (9,7), which is flagged and is not adjacent to any '1's or '2's that would be affected by it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the '2' at (3,2).\n\nAt (3,2), '2', with adjacent cells:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\n- (3,1), (3,3)\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nNow, none of these are flagged, and some are unrevealed.\n\nSimilarly, hard to deduce directly.\n\nMaybe I should consider the '3' at (5,2) and see if I can find three adjacent cells that could logically contain bombs.\n\nLooking at (5,2)'s adjacent cells:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nAll of these are unflagged and unrevealed except (5,3), which is a '1'.\n\nNow, if I assume that three of these cells contain bombs, which ones make sense?\n\nWell, (5,3) is a '1', which needs only one adjacent bomb.\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n- (5,2), (5,4)\n\n- (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo, if (5,2) is part of the '1's bomb count, then only one of these needs to be a bomb.\n\nBut (5,2) is also part of the '3' at (5,2), which needs three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nThis is getting quite tangled.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the possibility of multiple configurations and see which one fits all the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a cell that, when revealed, would give me more information without risking hitting a bomb.\n\nFor example, revealing a cell that is not adjacent to any numbered cells or flagged cells.\n\nLooking at the board, it's tricky to find such a cell.\n\nWait, row 0 is entirely unexplored.\n\nMaybe I should consider revealing a cell in row 0, but that's risky because I have no information about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a cell that's adjacent to multiple numbers, which might help me deduce its safety.\n\nLooking back at (7,5)'s '1', with no adjacent flags, I could perhaps reveal one of its adjacent cells, but that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at the '2' at (8,5).\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,6)\n\n- (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nNone of these are flagged, except (9,7), which isn't adjacent.\n\nSo, for the '2' at (8,5), two of these eight cells contain bombs.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6) is a '1', so only one of its adjacent cells contains a bomb.\n\nLooking at the overlap between these two, cells like (7,5), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6), (9,5), (9,6).\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to determine exactly which cells contain bombs.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the '3' at (6,2).\n\nIts adjacent cells are:\n\n- (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,3)\n\n- (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nNone of these are flagged, and most are unrevealed.\n\nThis seems too vague to make a deduction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a cell that's the only possible location for a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nFor example, if a '1' has only one unflagged adjacent cell, then that cell must be a bomb.\n\nBut in this board, none of the '1's seem to have only one unflagged adjacent cell.\n\nSimilarly, the '2's don't seem to have only two unflagged adjacent cells.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLooking at the '1' at (7,5), with eight adjacent cells, only one contains a bomb.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6) is a '1', with eight adjacent cells, only one contains a bomb.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can look for a cell that's adjacent to both of these '1's and see if it's likely to be safe or a bomb.\n\nWait, (8,5) is adjacent to both (7,5) and (8,6).\n\nBut (8,5) is currently unrevealed.\n\nIf I flag (8,5) as a bomb, does that satisfy both '1's?\n\nWait, no, because (7,5)'s '1' would have its bomb in (8,5), and (8,6)'s '1' would have its bomb in (8,5), which works.\n\nBut then, looking at (5,2)'s '3', which also has (8,5) as an adjacent cell, but (8,5) is only one cell, and (5,2) needs three bombs in its adjacent cells.\n\nWait, no, (5,2)'s adjacent cells are different from (8,5)'s adjacent cells.\n\nWait, (5,2)'s adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,1), (5,3)\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNone of these are (8,5), so flagging (8,5) doesn't affect (5,2)'s count.\n\nBut, flagging (8,5) as a bomb would satisfy both (7,5)'s and (8,6)'s '1's.\n\nBut, (5,2) needs three bombs in its adjacent cells, and currently, none are flagged.\n\nIf I flag (8,5), that's one bomb, but it's not adjacent to (5,2).\n\nSo, I still need to place two more bombs in (5,2)'s adjacent cells.\n\nBut (5,2)'s adjacent cells are all unflagged and unrevealed, except (5,3), which is a '1'.\n\nSo, I could potentially flag two cells adjacent to (5,2) as bombs.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to decide which ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that (8,5) is a bomb, and then see what follows from that.\n\nIf (8,5) is a bomb, then (7,5)'s '1' is satisfied, and (8,6)'s '1' is satisfied.\n\nThen, looking at (8,5)'s adjacent cells:\n\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n- (8,4), (8,6)\n\n- (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)\n\nNow, (9,7) is flagged, but it's not adjacent to (8,5).\n\nSo, no conflict there.\n\nThen, looking at (8,4), which is adjacent to (8,5), and is unrevealed.\n\nSimilarly, (9,5) and (9,6) are unrevealed.\n\nBut, since (8,5) is a bomb, the '2' at (8,5) is satisfied, and the '1's are satisfied.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider revealing a cell that's less likely to be a bomb.\n\nLooking at the '1's and '2's, perhaps revealing a cell that's adjacent to multiple '1's could be safer.\n\nFor example, (8,4) is adjacent to (8,5)'s '2' and possibly other numbers.\n\nBut, without more information, it's still risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total number of flags remaining.\n\nThere are 9 flags remaining, and 10 bombs in total.\n\nSince one bomb is already flagged at (9,7), there are 9 bombs left to be flagged.\n\nNow, if I can find 9 cells that must contain bombs, I can flag them all.\n\nBut, given the current state of the board, it's not clear which 9 cells must contain bombs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a cell that, if revealed, would give me the most information.\n\nFor example, revealing a cell that's adjacent to multiple numbers could potentially unlock a larger area.\n\nLooking at (7,4), which is adjacent to (7,5)'s '1' and possibly other numbers.\n\nBut, again, it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the area around the '3' at (5,2).\n\nIf I can deduce the positions of the three bombs adjacent to it, that might help unlock other areas.\n\nBut, with so many unflagged and unrevealed cells around it, it's difficult to make a precise deduction.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps the safest move is to reveal a cell that's less likely to be a bomb based on the numbers I have.\n\nLooking at (7,5)'s '1', with eight adjacent cells and only one bomb, the probability of hitting a bomb is 1 in 8, which is 12.5%.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,6)'s '1', it's the same.\n\nComparatively, revealing a random cell on the board could have a higher risk, as there are 10 bombs on a 10x10 board, which is a 10% chance per cell.\n\nBut, since some areas are more likely to contain bombs based on the numbers, it's better to reveal cells in areas with lower bomb density.\n\nGiven that, perhaps revealing a cell adjacent to multiple '1's could be safer.\n\nFor example, (8,4) is adjacent to (8,5)'s '2' and possibly other numbers.\n\nBut, without more specific information, it's still a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider revealing a cell in an area that's isolated from the numbers, but that might be riskier.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps the best move is to reveal a cell adjacent to a '1' that doesn't have any flags adjacent to it.\n\nFor example, revealing (7,4), which is adjacent to (7,5)'s '1'.\n\nBut, again, there's a chance it could be a bomb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider placing a flag in a cell that's likely to be a bomb based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at (8,5), which is adjacent to both (7,5)'s '1' and (8,6)'s '1', and flagging it as a bomb would satisfy both '1's.\n\nThen, I can proceed to reveal other adjacent cells, knowing that the bomb is accounted for.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that this doesn't conflict with other numbers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps placing a flag at (8,5) is a reasonable move.\n\nThen, I can reveal other adjacent cells with more confidence.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that this doesn't lead to a contradiction with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that (8,5) is not a bomb, and see if that leads to a consistent scenario.\n\nIf (8,5) is not a bomb, then (7,5)'s '1' must have its bomb in one of its other adjacent cells, and similarly for (8,6)'s '1'.\n\nBut, with (8,5) not being a bomb, I need to find another cell adjacent to both to satisfy their '1's.\n\nBut, it's getting too speculative.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best move is to place a flag at (8,5) and proceed from there.\n\nBut, to be cautious, perhaps I should reveal a different cell first to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps revealing (7,4) is a safer option.\n\nGiven all this, I'll choose to reveal (7,4).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo proceed in this Minesweeper game, the next step is to reveal a cell that is likely safe based on the current board state. Given the complexity of the board and the need to avoid flags on safe cells, the best approach is to carefully select a cell with the lowest probability of containing a bomb.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAfter analyzing the board, it's observed that many cells around the numbers are still unexplored, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact locations of all bombs. The '1's and '2's provide some constraints, but without more information, it's difficult to make definitive decisions about which cells are safe or contain bombs.\n\nGiven that, the decision is to reveal a cell adjacent to a '1' that hasn't been explored yet. Specifically, cell (7,4) is chosen because it is adjacent to the '1' at (7,5), and revealing it could provide more information about the surrounding area without an immediate high risk, as only one adjacent bomb is indicated by the '1'.\n\n**Move:**\n\nReveal cell at row 7, column 4.\n\n**Format:**\n\nEXPLANATION: Reveal a cell adjacent to a '1' to gain more information about the board.\n\nMOVE: 7,4,false", "flags_remaining": 9, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n1 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n2 . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n3 . . 2 _ 1 . 1 _ _ _\n4 . . 1 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _\n5 . . 3 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 3 1 1 _ _ _ _\n7 . . . . . 1 _ _ _ _\n8 . . . . . 2 1 _ _ _\n9 . . . . . . 1 F _ _", "sucess": false}
