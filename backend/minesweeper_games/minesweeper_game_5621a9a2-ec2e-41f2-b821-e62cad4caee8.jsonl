In Minesweeper, the first move is typically a random or strategic selection to reveal an initial area.\n\nIn this case, a common strategy is to choose a central square that has a high probability of revealing multiple empty spaces. Since this is a 10x10 board, I'll choose the center.\n\nEXPLANATION: First move in the center to maximize the chance of revealing multiple empty squares and getting initial information about the board.\n\nMOVE: 4,4,false\n\nThis move targets the central square (4,4), which statistically has a good chance of being an empty space or revealing a low-numbered tile that can help guide subsequent moves.", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n9 . . . . . . . . . .", "sucess": true}

Around (4,1), there's a '3' which suggests multiple adjacent bombs. \n2. The surrounding area near (4,1) has some interesting number patterns.\n3. We know 10 bombs total are on the board, and we currently have 10 flags remaining.\n\nKey observations:\n- Around (4,1), the '3' suggests 3 bombs in the adjacent 8 squares\n- The area around (4,1) has some unexplored spaces that look promising for a safe reveal\n\nI'm going to reveal the tile at (5,1), which seems relatively safe based on surrounding numbers.\n\nMOVE: 5,1,false\n\nReasoning:\n- This tile is near the '3' at (4,1) but doesn't seem directly adjacent to suspected bomb areas\n- It's surrounded by low-numbered tiles, suggesting a lower probability of being a bomb\n- Revealing this will give us more information about the surrounding area", "flags_remaining": 10, "board_state": "  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 _ _ 1 . 1 _ _ 1 . .\n1 _ _ 1 . 1 _ 1 2 . .\n2 _ _ 1 1 1 _ 1 . 2 1\n3 1 1 _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _\n4 . 3 2 1 _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 . . . 2 _ _ _ _ _ _\n6 . . . 3 _ _ _ 1 1 1\n7 1 3 . 2 _ _ _ 1 . .\n8 _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ 1 1 1\n9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "sucess": false}
