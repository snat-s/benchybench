Since (0,5) is already identified as a bomb, (1,5) cannot have any bombs adjacent to (1,4) and (1,6).\n- The '2's at (1,6), (1,7), and (1,8) indicate that at least 2 of their adjacent cells must be bombs.\n- Reviewing these, we can clearly see that all flags currently placed do not violate any immediate adjacent number requirements, but we need to be cautious about the numbers around these areas.\n\n### Conflict Identification:\n- For the '2' at (1,7), there currently are 2 unexplored spaces at (2,7) and (1,8). Since (0,6) and (0,5) are already counted.\n- For the '1' at (2,8), it has two adjacent flags but could only have had one bomb; therefore, at (2,2) there\u2019s a conflict.\n- The '1' at (8,0) has a flag there. Likewise, there is a conflict involving these numbers.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1.
